1
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,300
Okay, so what's the next step?
那么，下一步是什么？

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,200
This is the most common subject line
在看了我先前的5个视频的人所发给我的数百封邮件中，

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,340
in the hundreds of emails that I receive from people who have watched the first five videos
这个是最常见的主题，

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,200
in the 'Teachings of Jesus' playlist.
在这个“耶稣的教导”的列表里。

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,120
They've seen the need to forsake all in obedience to Jesus
他们已经看到了在顺从耶稣的事情上，撇下所有的重要性。

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,480
but they all imagine that they'll be left standing on the side of the road
但是他们都在想像之后他们会被扔在路边，

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:34,920
with only the clothes on their backs, when it's all over, slowly starving to death and dying for lack of medicines.
只有他们的衣服在背后，这就完了，只能慢慢的死于饥饿，或者死于疾病，

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,380
Freezing from the cold.
或者死于寒冷。

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,480
Or facing some other miserable existence that will ultimately kill them and all their family.
或者是面对一些可悲的状况，导致最终会毁了他们和他们的家庭。


10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,900
The most common assumption is that the next step is to head off into the wild
最常见的假想中的下一步，是向着旷野前进

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,000
foraging for food and maybe eventually finding a little plot of ground in the mountains
去寻找食物，或许最终能在山上找到一小块地，

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,340
where they can grow their own food until Jesus returns.
在那里，他们可以种些食物自己吃，直到耶稣回来。

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,720
Now, the idea of dying, whether through starvation, the cold, or some illness, is probably not a bad one
现在，这个关于死亡的想法，无论是饿死，是冻死，或是病死，或许不是个坏想法，

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:13,560
because it forces us to face the ultimate consequence of living by faith in Jesus.
因为那会强迫我们面对最终极的结果：在基督里靠信心永远活着。

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,660
He says, "Take up your cross, and follow me."
他说，“背起你的十字架来跟随我。”

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,380
Until we get it into our heads that God is allowed to let us die
我们的头脑要明白，除非上帝许可我们死，

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,140
we are not really going to be ready for what is next.
我们不会真的死掉，下一步不会就绪。

18
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,900
Some of the excuses that people come up with for not obeying Jesus when he says to leave it all behind
有一些借口，在人们准备不顺从耶稣的话时被使用，他们说从永恒的角度来看，

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,540
can be pretty pathetic in the light of eternity.
撇下一切是一个非常没有价值的事情。

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,260
I have to ask myself, "Do these people believe there's a God at all?"
我必须得问我自己，“这些人是真相信有一位上帝吗？”

21
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,460
"Can't they see that he has the right to tell them to leave it all?"
“他们看不到他有着让他们撇下一切的权力吗？”

22
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,100
"And can't they see, that he has the power to provide whatever he thinks they need?"
“他们看不到他有能力提供一切他认为他们需要的吗？”

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,480
"So why are they making excuses?"
“所以他们为什么找借口？”

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,980
Nevertheless, the answer as to what is next
不管怎样，这个答案就像“下一步是什么”一样，

25
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,400
should be right there in our subconscious from the moment that we hear Jesus speaking to us and saying
当我们听到耶稣教导我们时，在我们的潜意识里出现，

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,820
"Leave it all for me."
当耶稣说“为我撇下一切”时。

27
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,600
At the end of Matthew's gospel, and at the end of Mark's gospel, are verses which had been referred to as
在马太福音的最后，还有在马可福音的最后，是一些被我们称为：

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,900
the Great Commission.
大使命，的经文。

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,500
They say, "Go into all the world, and preach the good news, to everyone."
那里说，“你们往普天下去，传福音给万民听”。

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,040
Matthew's version adds these words
在马太福音里添加了这些话：

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,980
"Teaching them to obey everything that I have told you to do."
凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，

32
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,940
So, imagine yourself sitting on a curb, with your face in your hands, praying about what to do next
所以，想像你在托着你的脸想这个问题，祷告询问着撇下所有之后干啥，

33
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,200
and then these words come to mind
之后，这个话会进入你的脑海，

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,520
"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to everyone
“你们往普天下去，传福音给万民听”。

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,520
"teaching them to obey everything that I've just told you to do."
凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，

36
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,340
Does that sound like heading off into the wilderness to forge for food?
这听起来像是走进旷野去寻找食物吗？

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,500
Does it sound like planting vegetables and getting a milk cow?
这听起来像是种菜或者挤牛奶吗？

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,620
Does it sound like moving in with your parents and letting them feed you?
这听起来像是搬去和你父母住去啃老吗？

39
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,620
Or does it sound like going out and finding a new job so you can take care of your wife and kids?
或者这听起来像是出去找个新工作来照顾你的妻子孩子吗？

40
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,560
No, to all of these questions.
不，这些都不是。

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,480
It sounds like you already have a job, and you need to get busy doing it.
这听起来像是你已经有这个工作了，现在你需要忙起来做这个工作。

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,200
There are any number of ways
有许多的方法，

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,740
that you might try to get others to see and hear what you have seen and heard from Jesus.
你可以使用，来让别人看到听到你从耶稣所看到听到的。

44
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:31,140
And the more you listen to Jesus, the more you will be able to share with others, in one way or another.
并且，你听耶稣的话越多，你能够和人分享的也越多，通过某种方法或其他的方法。

45
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:38,500
One way could be to hire a hall and fill it with people, so you can stand up on the stage and preach to them.
一个方法是租个大厅，招满人来听，然后你可以站在舞台上向他们讲道。

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,120
Another might be to ask the local church to let you preach.
另一个方法或许是找个教会请他们许可你讲道。

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,200
Do you think you would be successful with either of them?
你认为你能用上面任一种方法获得成功吗？

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,280
Probably not.
或许并不能。

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,520
The local church, in particular, doesn't want to you in the teachings of Jesus
在教会里，尤其是教会，不会想让你教导耶稣的话。

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,440
we can be pretty sure of that.
我们很确信这一点。

51
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,520
And filling a hall with listeners
租个大厅招满人？

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,420
in a world where thousands of other voices are screaming for their attention every day
在这个世界上，有着千万种声音在吸引着人们的注意力，

53
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,240
can be a huge ask for most of us as well.
让人来听对大部分人是个艰巨的要求。

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,600
I know I've never been able to do either with much success.
我知道，我不能用上面的任何一种方法获得什么成功。

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,560
But you could do like Jesus: go out into the marketplaces and talk to people.
但是你可以像耶稣那样做：去到市场上去，对人们传讲。

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
That should get you up off the curb and on to your feet.
这会使你脱离压抑，走出去。

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,240
Shouting a sermon may work for a few people
大声的喊叫传道或许对一些人有用，

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,380
but I found that pretty difficult too, because today's world is just too busy
但我发现那个也相当的困难，因为今天的世界实在太忙了，

59
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,020
to stop and listen to a proper sermon.
人们根本没有时间停下来听道。

60
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,460
So, it kind of comes down to one on one witnessing to every creature.
所以，一对一的向每个被造物见证耶稣或许可行，

61
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,720
This works best in places where people are sitting down
当人们在坐着的时候，这个效果最好，

62
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,800
possibly with a few seconds that they can give to hearing what you have to say.
人们或许会给你几秒钟来听你必须说的话。

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,980
In parks, at bus stops, almost anywhere that you can find a bench or a table.
你可以这样在公园里，在公交站点，在每一个你可以找到凳子或桌子的地方。

64
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,400
You may need to show some interest in them to get started.
或许你要对他们表现的有兴趣来开始。

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,320
But approaching such people is definitely
 a very good way to share the good news.
但是那样的靠近一些人，无疑是一个非常好的传福音的方法。

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,040
The more you talk to people, 
the more you will learn just from experience
随着你向更多的人传讲，你会从你的经历中学到更多，

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,180
about how to get their attention and how to keep their interest
你也会学到如何获得人们的注意力并且让他们保持兴趣，

68
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,160
as you share the good news of Jesus with them.
就像你学会如何向他们分享耶稣的福音一样。

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,500
However, thanks to the modern media, we are now able to print up thousands of what we call 'tracts'
但是在今天，感谢现代的媒体，我们现在可以打印数千份的小册子，

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,040
which are just mini sermons on paper.
上面只写一些迷你讲道的内容。（注：简短讲道）

71
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,480
You can write and even illustrate your own tracks
and offer them to people.
你可以写下你自己的小册子，向人们展示，送给人们。

72
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,360
This has, by far, been the most proven and most successful way I've ever found to preach the gospel
这一个方法，在很长的时间里成为我们能找到的最有效的传福音的方法。

73
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,680
well, until I discovered YouTube.
直到有天，我发现了Youtube。

74
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,440
Through videos here on A Voice in the Desert, I've been able to reach over 300,000 people a month.
通过这些在“旷野之声”里的视频，每个月我能够触及到30万的人。

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,280
Nevertheless, even on the streets, you can offer these same videos, or others that you can make yourself
当然，就算在大街上，你也可以提供同样的视频，或者其他的你自己做的，

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,520
if you would prefer to do it that way, 
to people everywhere
如果你愿意那样做的话，你可以在任何地方送给人，

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,780
just by getting a DVD replicator
 to burn a hundred or more of them for you.
只需要有一个光盘复制器来烧录数百份或更多的光盘。

78
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,940
Wait a minute.
等一下。

79
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,220
How are you going to pay for all this material?
你打算怎样去为这些东西付款呢？

80
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,600
What I usually find is that even people who say they don't have anything to forsake
我经常发现的一件事情是，即使有些人说他们没有什么东西能撇下的，

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,100
actually do find they have enough possessions lying around to sell, and get maybe fifty dollars from them all.
但确实能发现他们有着许多东西在他们身边堆着，那些或许值个50美元。

82
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,120
That's enough to print up about a thousand little tracts or hundred DVDs and before you know it
那已经足够打印数千份小册子或者数百份光盘了，在不知不觉中，

83
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,980
you're out there preaching the gospel.
你已经正在传福音了。

84
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,720
Of course, if you don't even have $50,
 you can still witness by word of mouth.
当然，即使你没有50美元，你仍然可以用你的口所说的话来见证耶稣。

85
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,660
Now, at this stage, you still don't know what you're going to do for breakfast, much less lunch
现在，在这个阶段，你仍然不知道如何搞到你的早饭，更不用说午饭了。

86
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,520
but remember, it's all about faith.
但是请记住，这些都关乎信心。

87
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,340
The important thing for us is to preach the gospel.
对我们来说重要的事情，是去传福音。

88
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,000
Jesus says, if we'll do the work he's given us to do,
 he'll provide the food.
耶稣说，如果我们去做他要我们做的工作，他会提供食物。

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,140
Nevertheless, even if you're going to starve to death,
 let's see how many thousands of people
再说了，即使你快要饿死了，我们却可以看到有那么多的人们，

90
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,060
we can witness to before we die.
听到了我们见证耶稣的福音。

91
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,300
Okay?
这足以。

92
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,240
I hope people are listening closely to what I'm saying here because
我希望人们能仔细的听我在这里说的，因为，

93
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,800
all this should be the natural flow on from forsaking all.
所有的这些是我们撇下一切后的很自然的走向。

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,600
You left your job, left your family, left the house, 
the car, your education, your friends


95
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,720
and you're in the process of laying down your life for God.

96
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,780
Right?

97
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,880
But what are you going to do
as you slowly starve or freeze to death?

98
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,280
You are going to obey the rest of what Jesus said.

99
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,900
You're going to obey the great commission.

100
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,440
You're going to go into all the world,
 or at least as much of it as you can reach

101
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,600
preaching the gospel to every person you see.

102
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,720
And here's when we come to an important crossroad.

103
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm saying, and I think Jesus was saying, that once you start doing this

104
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,400
once you start seeking first to build God's Kingdom-- he's going to move in and take care of your spiritual needs.

105
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,180
And this is where the devil comes with quite a radically different way to stop YOU from serving God.

106
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,520
Up to this point, he would be saying,"No! no! Don't do it! You'll die! It won't work!

107
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,020
"You're tempting God! You've cracked up!"

108
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,220
Isn't that right?

109
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,120
Aren't those the thoughts that to keep coming into your head to challenge you on this?

110
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,900
But now, after you've started actually doing something 
to share the gospel

111
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,860
he's going to takes a different approach.

112
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,840
Someone comes along--maybe another street person--and says, "You see that church over there?

113
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,500
"They give free clothes to street people in the hall next to the church, every Thursday."

114
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,380
Or someone will say, "There's a shelter just down the street where you can stay out of the cold tonight.

115
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,820
"Just go there before 7 p.m. and they'll give you a bed."

116
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,600
Or someone will say,
 "You see that grocery store?

117
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,880
"In the bin behind the store are a hundred loaves of bread they threw out this morning

118
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,400
"you can eat your fill, for free"

119
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,220
Or someone will say, "Hey those little tracks (or DVDS) are quite good, but they must cost you money to print.

120
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,760
"Why don't you just ask people for a few cents to help pay for them?

121
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,860
"I'm sure most people would be happy to do that."

122
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,700
And what do you suppose the Devil is going to say?

123
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,000
"You can't do that. You're living by Faith!

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,800
"God will take care of you without you having to humble yourselves and accept handouts from other people."

125
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,600
"The gospel should be free; you can't ask for donations!"

126
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,460
"It's stealing to take bread from a supermarket rubbish bin!"

127
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,820
You see what I mean?

128
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,080
You've actually done what Jesus told you to do, and in the process you've met people.

129
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,160
These same people have shown you there's plenty of food, warmth, clothing, even money around

130
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,760
that is yours for the asking.

131
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,240
Are you too proud to ask?

132
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,720
Jesus said to his disciples, when he sent them out with nothing but the clothes on their backs

133
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,840
"When you enter a town, ask who in that town is worthy

134
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,060
"and then stay with them and accept what they give you."

135
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,060
Doesn't sound so unbelievably supernatural when you put it that way, does it?

136
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,780
And that seems to be one of the reasons why
so many people miss it.

137
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:55,060
You just get out there, and you do the hard yards and then God uses other people to meet your needs.

138
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,960
Sometimes it does look like handouts.

139
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,980
They don't know that they're feeding God's servants, and in many cases, if they did know, they might throw you out.

140
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,580
But God uses them anyway.

141
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,560
Other times it looks like you're back on a paid job.

142
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,920
You give them a tract, they give you ten cents.

143
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,180
But in fact, you're prepared to give it 
for free, for as long as the tracts last.

144
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,800
It's just that they are doing what they do all the time

145
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,960
that is, giving you something to express their appreciation for what you have given them.

146
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:32,680
You feed them spiritually, and they feed you physically, even if it's only one cent that they give.

147
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,060
By the way, don't be afraid to refuse the donation

148
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,620
if it seems like the person giving it is not happy to be doing so.

149
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,980
We're not really selling the message, and we're not begging either.

150
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,420
We're just asking for free voluntary donations.

151
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,960
Is the picture starting to come together now?

152
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,280
Forsake all by all means, but don't stop there!

153
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,460
Go into all the world preaching the gospel.

154
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,120
If you have these two pieces to the puzzle,
you're well on your way.

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,420
A third piece is to work with other people.

156
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:13,240
You can learn more about that if you watch video number 5D in the 'Teachings of Jesus' playlist.

157
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Follow those three steps, and I think you'll discover it's not nearly as hard as you thought it would be.

158
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,860
And it could be many years before you or your family ever get around to starving to death.
