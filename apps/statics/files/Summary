summary of the book called "DaQinJingJiaoLiuXingBei".

Summary of chapter one: The cross of main land from Tang dynasty.

XiAn, which is the capital of Tang dynasty, was a great, and crowded city, but after the fall of the Tang dynasty, it was declined in the history. But beside of all these, there was a important discovery here: the big monument of Christianity which was buried in the earth through 1,000 years. And the name of this monument is called "DaQinJingJiaoLiuXingBei". 

And here is a story about this discovery: When people was digging the land, they found the solid stone buried in earth, after mopped the earth which adhered on it, they found some words there, so they decided to publish this discovery to others, and then, they got to know this is the monument called "DaQinJingJiaoLiuXingBei". And there was a cross sign on it. 

Because there was some worry about the monument, so they decided to move this to the temple called "JinSheng", and let it be managed by the monks who was living there. The name of this temple changed many times, but eventually, it was called "JinSheng" until Qing dynasty and kept as the biggest temple in XiAn. 

The discovery was soon known by many missionaries, and someone of them called "ZhangQingWu" was a Catholic, who can get the point of the monument that this monument is related to Catholicism. Thus, many missionaries got rubbings and sent those back to Rome, where the pope live in. By research, the meaning of the words on the monument was translated, that is "a monument to remember the huge influence of 'JingJiao' in Qin dynasty." The time of this monument was written on the tail said "JianZhong 2 years", it is AD 781. 

Because of the difficulty in the process of understanding the words of the monument, many Chinese scholars was confused with JingJiao duo to the knowledge lack of religion in western world, and thought it was another religion. However, it still proved that Christianity was preached in China. 

In the beginning of 20th century, a man named Holm, who was called "hunter of treasure", got a duplicate of this monument with the help his translator, and sent that to America. The original one was kept in "BeiLing museum" located in XiAn. And after that, the duplicate was sent to the court of pope in Vatican. Nowadays, there are many copies were made around the world. 

The religion of Christianity which called "JingJiao" in Tang dynasty, had been a recognized religion of Tang dynasty. In AD 618, Tang started to develop, with it's opened spirit, and in AD 638, July, JingJiao became a public religion with the certification of the emperor TaiZhong, who started to open his country to the foreign religions. 

The name of Christianity was called "DaQinJingJiao" in that period is because of the calling of Rome. From Han dynasty, Rome was well known in ancient China, and in that time, Rome was called "DaQin", so the religion came from western world was called "DaQinJiao". It also was called "Persian Jiao", "Messiah Jiao" too. 

Even the religion of Christianity which called "JingJiao" was came from western world, it had many similar words with "Confucianism", "Buddhism", and "Taoism". Because of the difficulty of translation, they used some existed words in the above listed three religions. Moreover, the missionaries who came to this land, had the similar clothes and hair styles with the believers of that three religions, and the church was called the same name with the temples of that three religions too. 

The religion of Christianity called "JingJiao" had prospered about 50 years after started preaching. But in the age of "WuZhong" emperor, AD 845, this emperor started to respect "Taoism" by oppressing the "Buddhism", because of this, "JiangJiao" was oppressed too. Nevertheless, the religion of Christianity was preached in China, spread to many other countries beside China. 

Through the history, we can conclude that there are two reasons that caused the extinction of "JingJiao". First is the well developed original religions, which are suitable for those aborigines, and this made the land too hard to accept new religions. Second one is the way of preaching, because of the protection and supports from the house of emperor, they preached the gospel from upper to lower, and thus, they can't get wide supports from people. 

From the extinction of "JingJiao", we can learn that Christianity is not a religion belongs just to the privileged ones, but conversely, the servants. The gospel came to this world, not as a member of the house of emperor, but a member of the poor. We should remember that, our Lord came to the world, not to be served, but to serve. 
If we want to preach the gospel to Chinese, we shall not preach just to those "upper" ones, but more importantly, those "lower" ones. It seems unwise, because all of us know that the rich men have more powerful influence than poor men. But it's the way of salvation, and God use such "unwise way" to save countless life. The gospel, is came from heaven, but started from a manger in the earth.
