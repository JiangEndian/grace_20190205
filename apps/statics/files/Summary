summary of the book called "DaQinJingJiaoLiuXingBei".

Summary of chapter one: The cross of main land from Tang dynasty.

XiAn, which is the capital of Tang dynasty, was a great, and crowded city, but after the fall of the Tang dynasty, it was declined in the history. But beside of all these, there was a important discovery here: the big monument of Christianity which was buried in the earth through 1,000 years. And the name of this monument is called "DaQinJingJiaoLiuXingBei". 

And here is a story about this discovery: When people was digging the land, they found the solid stone buried in earth, after mopped the earth which adhered on it, they found some words there, so they decided to publish this discovery to others, and then, they got to know this is the monument called "DaQinJingJiaoLiuXingBei". And there was a cross sign on it. 

Because there was some worry about the monument, so they decided to move this to the temple called "JinSheng", and let it be managed by the monks who was living there. The name of this temple changed many times, but eventually, it was called "JinSheng" until Qing dynasty and kept as the biggest temple in XiAn. 

The discovery was soon known by many missionaries, and someone of them called "ZhangQingWu" was a Catholic, who can get the point of the monument that this monument is related to Catholicism. Thus, many missionaries got rubbings and sent those back to Rome, where the pope live in. By research, the meaning of the words on the monument was translated, that is "a monument to remember the huge influence of 'JingJiao' in Qin dynasty." The time of this monument was written on the tail said "JianZhong 2 years", it is AD 781. 

Because of the difficulty in the process of understanding the words of the monument, many Chinese scholars was confused with JingJiao duo to the knowledge lack of religion in western world, and thought it was another religion. However, it still proved that Christianity was preached in China. 

In the beginning of 20th century, a man named Holm, who was called "hunter of treasure", got a duplicate of this monument with the help his translator, and sent that to America. The original one was kept in "BeiLing museum" located in XiAn. And after that, the duplicate was sent to the court of pope in Vatican. Nowadays, there are many copies were made around the world. 

The religion of Christianity which called "JingJiao" in Tang dynasty, had been a recognized religion of Tang dynasty. In AD 618, Tang started to develop, with it's opened spirit, and in AD 638, July, JingJiao became a public religion with the certification of the emperor TaiZhong, who started to open his country to the foreign religions. 

The name of Christianity was called "DaQinJingJiao" in that period is because of the calling of Rome. From Han dynasty, Rome was well known in ancient China, and in that time, Rome was called "DaQin", so the religion came from western world was called "DaQinJiao". It also was called "Persian Jiao", "Messiah Jiao" too. 

Even the religion of Christianity which called "JingJiao" was came from western world, it had many similar words with "Confucianism", "Buddhism", and "Taoism". Because of the difficulty of translation, they used some existed words in the above listed three religions. Moreover, the missionaries who came to this land, had the similar clothes and hair styles with the believers of that three religions, and the church was called the same name with the temples of that three religions too. 

The religion of Christianity called "JingJiao" had prospered about 50 years after started preaching. But in the age of "WuZhong" emperor, AD 845, this emperor started to respect "Taoism" by oppressing the "Buddhism", because of this, "JiangJiao" was oppressed too. Nevertheless, the religion of Christianity was preached in China, spread to many other countries beside China. 

Through the history, we can conclude that there are two reasons that caused the extinction of "JingJiao". First is the well developed original religions, which are suitable for those aborigines, and this made the land too hard to accept new religions. Second one is the way of preaching, because of the protection and supports from the house of emperor, they preached the gospel from upper to lower, and thus, they can't get wide supports from people. 

From the extinction of "JingJiao", we can learn that Christianity is not a religion belongs just to the privileged ones, but conversely, the servants. The gospel came to this world, not as a member of the house of emperor, but a member of the poor. We should remember that, our Lord came to the world, not to be served, but to serve. 
If we want to preach the gospel to Chinese, we shall not preach just to those "upper" ones, but more importantly, those "lower" ones. It seems unwise, because all of us know that the rich men have more powerful influence than poor men. But it's the way of salvation, and God use such "unwise way" to save countless life. The gospel, is came from heaven, but started from a manger in the earth. 


Summary of chapter two: JingJiao entered into Beijing, the center of Yuan Dynasty. 

Beijing, has a long history as the capital of China, and there are many historical events occurred there. Especially the Christian part which called JingJiao, has had prospered in this place. 

JingJiao was preached in China from Tang dynasty, although was prospered in a short period, it was oppressed by the religious persecution. That was the first time of China to meet Christianity. However, JingJiao was not died thoroughly under religious persecution, it still lived until the Song dynasty, and the believer around the land of China. 

Genghis Khan made the Mongolia be prospered, and lead his armies conquered the middle Asia, China mainland, middle east, and even Europe. While he expand his domain quickly, he can't continue his dominion at so many place. However, his grandson, Kublai Khan is different. Kublai Khan governed the north part of China, and eventually, destroyed the Song dynasty, which was governing the south part of China, thus he conquered the whole mainland of China, and changed the name of his dynasty as "Yuan", set Beijing as capital. From then, the mainland of China which was centered with Han's culture, was changed to a multicultural land which was centered with Mongolian culture. 

Yuan dynasty govern his land by the was to separate his citizens, set Mongolian and "SeMuRen" as the upper level to govern, and set Han as the lower level to be controlled. The group called "SeMuRen" was an important role in Yuan dynasty, they dominated the area of politics, economy, military, religions, etc. The government of Yuan dynasty was very kind to the group of "SeMuRen", and one bishop called Andrea da Perugia talked about this said in this great nation, they have freedom in religion, and no one can disturb them when they were preaching. Because of this freedom of religion, JingJiao, which was oppressed in Tang dynasty, prospered again in Yuan dynasty, and even in the house of emperor, there was many believers. 

The temple of JingJiao was build in many place in this period. At 1240, an official called "AnJiMaShi" build a temple of JingJiao in southern land, "MaoTaiDiGuo" build a church called "Cross Church". And it was said that at 1245 BC, "AnJiMaShi" build 7 churches. Moreover, the believer of JingJiao have many privilege, such as exempt from military service and tax. 

The believer of JingJiao in that period was also called "Tarsak", "Arkaun" too. The name "Arkaun" was created from the Hebrew word "Elohim"(אֱלֹהִים) and Mongolian word "Arkaun", means "believer of God", "the group are following gospel" or "blessed man". Not only the name of believer, but also the name of temple was changed. At 1315, the temple's name of JingJiao which was called "Sha"(temple) changed to "Yuan"(yard), and set 72 office around the whole nation. From this we can get to know that how prospered was JingJiao in that period. 

At 1887, a man lived in the north west of Persia called Salomon, got a book from a young JingJiao believer. It's the biography of Bar Sauma, who met pope in 1288 to ask for missionaries. And thus, the pope accepted his requisition, sent Giovanni da Monte corvino and Nicholas to Mongolia at 1289.

In 1293, Monte corvino went by ChuanZou, where was the main trade port in Yuan dynasty, and arrived Beijing, the capital of Yuan dynasty. However, because of the early die of the older emperor, the letter of pope was received by his grandson Tamul Khan, who allow Monte corvino staying in Beijing and having religious activities in Beijing. From this event, we know that the emperor was a JingJiao believer. 

The process of meeting JingJiao was not easy for Catholic, because Catholic has had claimed that JingJiao is a heresy, thus, Monte corvino, the believer of Catholic, he and his team, was persecuted and captured frequently by JingJiao believer, and they were excluded from many activities.   

Nevertheless, Monte corvino got the help of GaoTangWang, and translated New Testament to Mongolian, also, he painted many pictures of New Testament, and used those pictures to teach those illiteracy. Furthermore, he build the earliest catholic church in XiJing, when was the western capital of that period. And in his last ten years of his mission, he build more churches in three places. Such mission made more than 6000 men became believer. 

At 1305, Monte corvino sent a letter to pope mentioned about opposite group, and thought there will be more than 30,000 believers if no such persecution. It's obvious, the opposite group means JingJiao mainly. 

Translation is the first problem in the christian mission. Before gospel was preached in China, there are some original religions existed, thus many words from such religions were used in christian translation. Because there are some problems occurred in the translation, many men have devoted themselves to solve such problems. 

The first translator is a catholic bishop called Mateo. When he came into China, he started to learn Chinese and China culture to do his mission, for such reasons, he is respected by Chinese. In 1595, Mateo published a book named "JiaoYouLun" for his mission in China, it was a book talk about the stories and sayings of famous western people. 

In 1582, Mateo arrived at Macao, but until 1601, he met the emperor ShenZhong, it's 19 years later. He preached gospel to ShenZhong, and sent gifts include the image of Jesus and Maria, the cross, and watch. But it seems that the watch was ShenZhong's favorite one. Through Mateo, ShenZhong get to known the western technology and science, and allowed him to preach gospel in Beijing, and provide some fund to support his mission. Thus, as a result, a catholic church was build inside XuanWuMen in 1605. Mateo died at 1610, buried in TengGongZaLan, Beijing. After Mateo, was Johann Ada Schall von Bell, Ferdinand Verbiest, etc. However, while it the time of Ming dynasty, he accepted the science and technology of western world, but rejected the western religion which is different with his own. 

The biggest problem in translation is the name of God. "God" was translated to Chinese "TianZhu" by Italian bishop. The meaning of "TianZhu" is "the highest one governing the whole world", but some of Chinese scholars think it's same with the word "ShangDi" in tradition books of Confucianism. Thus, the word "God" was translated to "TianZhu" and sometimes called "Tian" or "ShangDi". 

Another problem in the same period was the argue of ancestor worship. Mateo thought it's just the traditional culture of Chinese, and didn't connect it with religious meaning. It's not a problem for Mateo. The society of Jesus had the same thought with Mateo. On the contrary, there are many others thought the ancestor worship is an important problem same with idols worship. 

To solve above mentioned two problems, a conference was held in the court of Pope in 1628, and the result is that the ancestor worship is not idols worship but just to present respect to ancestors, according to the 5th Commandment about respect parents, it should be allowed to express respect to ancestors. And the problem of the translation of the name of "God", was sent back to Beijing to let them decide it by themselves. Thus, they accepted "TianZhu" and forbade other names in that period. However, the argue of this problem is not finished. 

From 1898 to 1900, was the movement of Boxer, in this movement, countless number of missionary and christian was killed. Even though, they never lost love toward Chinese. Admittedly, there were some reasons that caused the Boxer to kill christian, and one reasons is that the church protect some ones who were not good, and accepted those bad men as christian. While the Boxer try to attack the church, those missionaries will suppress Chinese government to subdue Chinese, thus, church got more hostility from Chinese, the bad circle was formed. However, although there were many victims killed by this movement, love never fails, there were many love stories in that horrible period. 

A great person was born in that period, and changed the Chinese Christianity a lot, that "WangMingDao". He was born in a poor christian family in Beijing, 1900, July, and his original name was "WangYongSheng". He got a name from his grandmother, called "TieZhi", which means iron, and his steel spirit was same with that name. He became a preacher at 1920, and to denote his mission, he changed his name to "WangMingDao", which means illuminating the word or road. He started family church at 1925, and preached gospel around China in 20 years, died in the bosom of the Lord at July, 28, 1991. 

Another great person in the christian history of China is WuYaoZhong. WuYaoZhong selected a different way with WangMingDao, he started the "Three-self Patriotic Movement". He was born in 1893, a business family, and he established "Three-self Patriotic Movement" in 1954, as a chairman. Moreover, those who didn't joined his group was forbidden to have any activity. However, after 10 years, the Great Culture Revolution was held in China, he and his group was oppressed too. He died at September, 17, 1979, in Beijing. 

Through the christian history of China, we can saw the same persecution as in the 1st century's western world. Gospel will be attacked at first, wherever it be preached. But never be killed. Think about the childhood of Jesus, he was persecuted by the king of that region, that king wanted to kill Jesus, the word of God, but he can't. And although it seems that Jesus was killed on cross, he resurrected from death. He will be defeated a little time, maybe three days, but will be victory forever and ever. 

The Christianity has the same destiny with her Lord, wherever she was born, she will be persecuted at first time, regardless of western world or eastern world, and sometimes, she seems defeated, like the died JingJiao in China. But she won't fail for long time, she will rise again, and this time, she will never be defeated, she will be victory as her Lord. At the last day, she will be taken to the kingdom of heaven like her Lord. They will live together forever and ever.
