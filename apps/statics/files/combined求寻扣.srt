00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,740
Please read Luke 11:5-13
请阅读路加福音 11:5-13

2
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:00,280
There are bits and pieces of verses from the Bible which sound like prayer is all about getting what you want.
圣经中有一些经文片段，听起来像是祷告就是为了得到你想要的。

3
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,800
Some of them come from this passage.
其中一些来自这段经文。

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,940
Whether it's prayer for a loved one to be saved, or prayer for your own salvation
无论是为所爱的人得救祷告，还是为自己的得救祷告

5
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,120
prayer for healing, prayer for wealth, popularity, and success of any sort
祈求治愈、祈求财富、声望和任何形式的成功

6
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,300
or prayer for protection in dangerous situations
或祷告在危险情况下得到保护

7
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,620
we do seem to have a strong belief that God is just there waiting for us to ask for something
我们似乎坚信上帝就在那里等着我们祈求什么

8
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,680
so that he can give it.
这样他就可以给了。

9
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,180
But something is wrong with this approach, and it bothers me.
但是这种方法有问题，这让我很困扰。

10
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,480
I keep saying that people get into trouble spiritually
我一直说人们在属灵上会遇到麻烦

11
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,220
because they take half a truth and run with it. It happens all the time, unfortunately.
因为他们接受了一半的真理并实践之。不幸的是，这样的事情总是发生。

12
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,880
In general, they want to claim all the promises--all the fun stuff--
总的来说，他们想要得到所有的承诺——所有有趣的东西——

13
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,220
and then skip all the commands, and all the more unpleasant stuff.
然后跳过所有命令，以及所有更不愉快的东西。

14
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,900
Really, it should be just the other way around.
真相是，它应该是相反的。

15
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:55,820
The promises are God's business, and the commands are our responsibility...whether we like it or not.
应许是上帝的事，命令是我们的责任……无论我们喜欢与否。

16
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,120
This same problem is at its worst when it comes to salvation.
当涉及到救恩时，同样的问题是最糟糕的。

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,720
You wouldn't believe how many people write to me and straight-out say, "no way!"
你很难相信有多少人给我写信并直截了当地说，“不可能！”

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,580
"I'm not going to obey Jesus; at least not now.
“我不会顺服耶稣；至少现在不会。

19
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:14,320
"Maybe someday, but I'm not ready for it yet. It would make me unpopular or lead to tension with my family.
“也许有一天，但我还没有准备好。这会让我不受欢迎或导致与家人关系紧张。

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,960
"I would freeze or starve to death." And on and on with one excuse after another.
“我会冻死或饿死。”一个又一个的借口。

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,260
But then they finish off with talk about how they're just going to keep serving God
但是他们最后谈论他们将如何继续事奉上帝

22
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,300
by sharing the faith wherever they can.
通过尽可能的分享信仰。

23
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,260
And then they thank God profusely in my presence for loving them so much
然后他们在我面前非常感谢上帝如此爱他们

24
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,740
and for having saved them, like there's no connection at all between their arrogance
也因为救了他们，就像他们的傲慢与

25
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,820
about what Jesus has told us to do, and their assumption that God is still going to save them.
耶稣告诉我们要做的事情没有任何的关系，以及他们认为上帝仍会拯救他们。

26
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,760
They talk about what a wonderful God he is, because he's going to save them no matter what.
他们谈论他是多么美妙的上帝，因为无论如何他都会拯救他们。

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,940
So what have they done?
那么他们做了什么？

28
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,100
They have done the same as all the Voodoo worshipers and witch doctors in the world.
他们和世界上所有的巫毒崇拜者和巫医一样。

29
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,940
They have assumed that if they pick and choose the right bits and pieces of the Bible
他们假设如果他们挑选正确的圣经片段

30
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,760
they can devise a formula where they can control God
他们可以设计一个公式来控制上帝

31
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,960
and they can have it all their way without ever having to obey Jesus even once.
他们可以一路走好，甚至一次都不必顺服耶稣。

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Before we go back to that passage of scripture from Jesus in Luke 11, I want to explain something.
在我们回到路加福音 11 章耶稣的那段经文之前，我想解释一些事情。

33
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,980
The Gospels were written for people who had already accepted Jesus and all that he taught.
福音书是为已经接受耶稣和他所教导的一切的人写的。

34
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,540
For some of them, they had started following Jesus many years earlier.
他们中的一些人多年前就开始跟随耶稣。

35
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,700
The Gospels were written for these people in the early church
福音书是为早期教会中的这些人而写的

36
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,400
about thirty five years after Jesus ascended to heaven.
耶稣升天后大约三十五年。

37
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,940
They were written so they would not forget the most important things that he said.
是为了他们不会忘记他所说的最重要的事情而写的。

38
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,180
So there were times when the writers just naturally assumed
所以有时候作者们会很自然地假设

39
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,540
that people reading the Gospels would have the overall picture.
读福音书的人会有整体的画面。

40
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,280
They weren't operating on the assumption that every single verse had to be complete in and of itself.
他们并没有假设每一节经文本身都必须是完整的。

41
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,520
Every piece was part of a bigger picture which had grown out of them just naturally obeying Jesus
每一块都是一幅更大图景的一部分，这幅图景是由他们自然地顺服耶稣而形成的

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,060
for all those years.
在他们顺服的那些年。

43
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,780
You can see it right there in the context of this eleventh chapter of Luke.
你可以在路加福音第十一章的上下文中看到它。

44
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,200
Jesus is addressing men who have given up everything to follow him
耶稣正在对那些放弃一切跟随他的人说话

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,900
and they are wanting to get a clearer understanding about exactly what prayer is supposed to achieve
他们想要更清楚地了解祷告应该达到什么目的

46
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,500
and how it works.
以及它是如何工作的。

47
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,280
So Jesus says, "it's all about sorting out just how serious you are about what you want.
所以耶稣说，“这一切都是为了弄清楚你对自己想要的东西有多认真。

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,700
"How serious are you about following me?
“你有多么认真的跟着我？

49
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,280
"How serious are you about building the kingdom of heaven that I've been talking about?
“你对我说的建立天国是真的相信的吗？

50
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,240
"How serious are you about laying down your life for me?"
“你有多真诚的要为我舍命？”

51
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,200
You see, it's not about being cured of cancer, or getting a good job, or finding a nice girlfriend
你看，这不是治愈癌症，或者找到一份好工作，或者找到一个好女朋友

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,060
or even about your husband, or your children, or the people next door being saved.
甚至不是关于你的丈夫、你的孩子，或者隔壁的人得救。

53
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,560
Now, you may think it's unfair of me to say that
现在，你可能认为我这样说是不公平的

54
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
and you will find support for your position in some of what is written here.
您会在此处所写的一些内容中找到对您立场的支持。

55
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,880
It sounds like you can just name it and claim it.
听起来你可以给它命名并声明它。

56
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,200
In a way, that does work.
在某种程度上，这确实有效。

57
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,420
If the only thing in the world that you want is a million dollar house
如果在这世界上你只想要一百万美元的房子

58
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,960
and you are ready to sacrifice everything else on earth to get it; there is a very good chance that you will get it.
你准备牺牲地球上的一切来得到它；你很有可能得到它。

59
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,440
And then you can say, "see? it worked for me. It'll work for you.
然后你可以说，“看到了吗？这对我有用。这也会对你有用。

60
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,920
"It's right there in the Bible. God's plan for unlimited prosperity. It goes like this:
“它就在圣经里。上帝对无限繁荣的计划。它是这样的：

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,700
"Though God will not give it to you because you are a follower of him
“虽然上帝不会因为你是他的追随者就给你

62
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,420
"if you pester him long enough, he'll give it to you just to get you off his back.
“如果你纠缠他的时间够长，他会把它给你，只是为了摆脱你。

63
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,100
"There it is. Right there, in verse 8.
“就在那里。就在那里，在第 8 节。

64
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,040
"Jesus himself taught it. Can you see it?
“耶稣自己教的。你能看到吗？

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,420
"You name it, you claim it. And you keep on claiming it long enough, and you'll get it
“你命名它，你宣告它。你继续宣告它足够长的时间，你就会得到它

66
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,040
"whether God wants you to have it or not.
“无论上帝希望你拥有与否。

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,920
"You can control God. Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!"
“你可以控制上帝。赞美主！哈利路亚！”

68
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:57,360
Verses 9 and 10 support it even more: "Ask and it shall be given you, seek and you shall find
第 9 节和第 10 节更加支持它：“祈求就给你，寻找就寻见

69
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,180
"knock and it shall be opened unto you.
“扣门，就给你开门。

70
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,680
"For every one that asks receives, and he that seeks finds, and to him that knocks it shall be opened."
“凡祈求的，就得着，寻找的，就寻见，叩门的，就给他开门。”

71
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,240
Praise God! We have unlocked the code. This is your key to God's bank.
赞美神！我们已经解锁了密码。这是你进入上帝银行的钥匙。

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,840
You have him in a stranglehold and he has no choice but to give you what you ask for.
你把他束缚住了，他别无选择，只能满足你的要求。

73
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,620
But then...
但是之后...

74
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,380
Jesus gives the bigger picture.
耶稣给出了大一些的图景。

75
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,480
And like I keep saying, the problem in understanding the teachings of Jesus
就像我一直说的，理解耶稣教义的问题

76
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,500
always comes because people run off with a half truth.
因为人们总是只带着一半的真相。

77
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,380
The truth is usually not that hard to see if we really want to see it.
如果我们真的想看到它，真相通常并不难看。

78
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,100
But we have to be open to hearing what we don't naturally want to hear.
但是我们必须对听到我们本性不想听到的东西持开放态度。

79
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,920
In this case, it comes in two stages.
在这种情况下，它分为两个阶段。

80
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,720
The truth in the first stage shifts the emphasis slightly, but it is not immediately obvious.
第一阶段的真相稍微转移了重点，但并不是立即显而易见。

81
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,520
"If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?
“如果有儿子向你们中的任何一个父亲要饼，他会给他石头吗？

82
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,480
"Or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
“或者如果他求一条鱼，他会给他一条蛇吗？

83
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,340
"Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?"
“或者如果他要一个鸡蛋，他会给他一只蝎子吗？”

84
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,880
This much is still talking about the father giving us what we're asking for, right?
这仍然是在谈论父亲给了我们我们所要求的东西，对吧？

85
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,980
But do you notice that Jesus has brought another factor into the story here? Can you see it?
但是你有没有注意到耶稣在这个故事中加入了另一个因素？你能看见它吗？

86
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,600
Come on, it's there if you look.
来吧，如果你看，它就在那里。

87
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:30,320
He has compared something that is good for you with something that is bad for you. Can you see it now?
他将一些对你有益的事物与对你不利的事物进行了比较。你现在能看到吗？

88
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,260
And this is the part which the "name it and claim it" prosperity teachers consistently overlook.
而这正是“命名并宣告”成功教师一贯忽视的部分。

89
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,560
Some will try to convince you that your selfish desires are good for you.
有些人会试图说服你，你的自私欲望对你有好处。

90
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,980
After all, you'll be able to do so much more for God if only you were rich
毕竟，只要你富有，你就能为上帝做更多的事

91
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,220
if only you are in complete health, if only you are famous and popular.
只要你身体健康，只要你出名和受欢迎。

92
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,220
But have a look at what the epistles say about this.
但是看看新约书信是怎么说的。

93
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:02,060
Paul writes to Timothy and he says, "they that would be rich have pierced themselves through many sorrows."
保罗写信给提摩太，他说：“那些贪恋钱财的人，已经被许多愁苦刺透了。”

94
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,180
He goes on to say, "the love of money is"...what?
他接着说，“对金钱的爱是”……什么？

95
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,620
What is the love of money? It's the root of all evil.
什么是爱钱？是万恶之源。

96
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,580
And what is it that the prosperity teachers are telling you to ask for? "Money", people shout. "Money".
成功导师告诉你要祈求什么？ “钱”，人们喊道。 “钱”。

97
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,540
"Not the love of money. The love of money is evil. But money itself...well, the more you can get, the better."
“不是爱钱。爱钱是邪恶的。但钱本身……好吧，你得到的越多越好。”

98
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:31,180
Seriously, does that sound like somebody who despises money or does it sound like someone who loves money?
说真的，这听起来像一个鄙视金钱的人还是听起来像一个爱钱的人？

99
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,760
Jesus said that if you try to work for God and work for money (or Mammon) at the same time
耶稣说，如果你同时为上帝工作和为金钱（或玛门）工作

100
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,820
you're going to end up despising one and loving the other.
你最终会鄙视一个而爱另一个。

101
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,320
Which one do you despise?
你鄙视哪一个？

102
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,940
Now, listen to what James says in his epistle:
现在，请听雅各在他的书信中说：

103
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,780
He says, "you ask and you do not receive because you ask amiss, that you may consume it upon your lusts."
他说：“你们求也得不着，因为你们妄求，叫你们随欲消费。”

104
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,240
Does that sound like what the prosperity gospel teachers preach?
这听起来像成功福音教师所宣扬的吗？

105
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,700
Of course not. They hate James almost as much as they hate Jesus.
当然不是。他们讨厌雅各几乎和他们讨厌耶稣一样。

106
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,720
So here we have, from James, a promise of a different color.
所以在这里，我们从詹姆斯那里得到了一种不同颜色的承诺。

107
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,960
He implies pretty strongly that you will not get what you ask for if you ask amiss, as he puts it.
他非常强烈地暗示，如果你问错了，你不会得到你想要的，正如他所说的。

108
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,980
That means you're asking for the wrong thing.
这意味着你要求错误的东西。

109
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,560
It's not expressed so clearly in the passage we are now reading from Luke 11
在我们现在读到的路加福音 11 章的经文中，它没有表达得如此清楚

110
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,200
but Jesus does say that a loving father will not give you something that is bad for you.
但耶稣确实说过，慈爱的父亲不会给你一些对你不利的东西。

111
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,440
If you pray for a fish, which was a symbol for Jesus in Bible times,
如果你祈求一条鱼，那是圣经时代耶稣的象征，

112
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,900
then yes, for sure, he'll give that to you.
那么是的，当然，他会给你的。

113
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,780
But if you pray for a snake, which is a symbol for the devil, he won't give that to you, will he?
但是如果你祈求一条蛇，它是魔鬼的象征，他不会给你的，是吗？

114
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,440
Now, if it's money you love, then you need to go to the devil worshipers to get it.
现在，如果是你爱的钱，那你就需要去找魔鬼崇拜者去拿。

115
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,800
Satan and his worshippers are out there in the mega churches all over the world these days
这些年代，撒旦和他的崇拜者在世界各地的大型教堂中

116
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,920
just waiting to appease your debauched and carnal appetites with such lies.
只是等着用这样的谎言来安抚你放荡的肉欲的欲望。

117
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,700
Now we come to the last line of this passage from Jesus about prayer.
现在我们来到耶稣关于祷告的这段经文的最后一行。

118
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:05,060
Remember, this is the line that most often contains the missing piece...the key to understanding all the rest.
请记住，这是最常包含缺失部分的行……这是理解所有其余部分的关键。

119
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,320
So listen to it carefully:
所以请仔细聆听：

120
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,020
"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children
“如果你那么邪恶，还知道如何给你的孩子送好礼物

121
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,540
"how much more shall your heavenly Father give..."
“你们的天父会给多么好的啊……”

122
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,760
Give what? "How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him."
给什么？ “何况你的天父将圣灵赐给求他的人呢？”

123
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,460
What is the father going to give you if you keep on asking, if you keep on seeking, if you keep on knocking?
如果你继续问，如果你继续寻找，如果你继续敲门，父亲会给你什么？

124
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,160
What is he going to give you if you do like the widow
如果你喜欢像那个寡妇一样的求，他会给你什么

125
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,540
begging, pleading, and never giving up in that one overriding prayer? What will he give you?
在那个压倒一切的祷告中乞求、恳求和永不放弃,他会给你什么？

126
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,040
Yes! The Holy Spirit.
是的！圣灵。

127
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,580
Man, how have they corrupted even the whole concept of the Holy Spirit?
人啊，他们竟然连圣灵的整个概念都败坏了？

128
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,940
A young girl in a pentecostal orphanage said to me many years ago, "if you want the Holy Spirit
多年前，五旬节孤儿院的一个小女孩对我说：“如果你想要圣灵

129
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,410
"you need to get a drum."
“你需要一个鼓。”

130
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:02,740
It's so typical of how they've been trained. Beat the drum, turn up the volume, turn on the smoke machine
这是他们受训方式的典型代表。敲鼓，调大音量，打开烟机

131
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,960
play on the emotions, generate the tears in whatever one you can
玩弄情绪，尽你所能制造眼泪

132
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,280
and then tell people that they have the Holy Spirit.
然后告诉人们他们有圣灵。

133
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,540
That is the lie they've been feeding us for decades now,
那是他们几十年来一直在给我们灌输的谎言，

134
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,240
and so people tell me that because they've had an emotional dream
所以人们告诉我这是因为他们有一个情感上的梦想

135
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,730
or because they've survived a car crash, or because they felt goose bumps
或者因为他们在车祸中幸存下来，或者因为他们感到起鸡皮疙瘩

136
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,340
they now have the Holy Spirit, and all the world should listen to them.
他们现在有圣灵，全世界都应该听他们的。

137
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,620
Believe me, it takes a lot more than that.
相信我，这需要的远不止这些。

138
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,360
Having the holy spirit is a lifelong commitment.
拥有圣灵是一生的承诺。

139
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,280
You see churches full of spiritual perverts running from one thrill to the next
你看到教堂里到处都是属灵扭曲的人，从一种刺激跑到另一种刺激

140
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,860
all claiming that they have the Holy Spirit, at the same time that they resist everything that Jesus ever said.
所有人都声称他们有圣灵，同时他们抗拒耶稣所说的一切。

141
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:51,800
Those 120 disciples in the upper room waited for 10 days for the Holy Spirit to come.
楼上那120个门徒等了10天，才等到圣灵降临。

142
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,720
I have no doubt that they went through a lot of tears and a lot of emotional ups and downs in those 10 days
我毫不怀疑，在那10天里，他们经历了很多眼泪和很多情绪起伏

143
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,120
while they wrestled with God and with their own faith.
当他们与上帝和自己的信仰较力时。

144
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,180
I can imagine that, at each step along the way, God would ask
我可以想象，在沿途的每一步，上帝都会问

145
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,560
"Is that what you want? Some petty thrill? Or do you want the real thing?"
“这就是你想要的？一些小小的刺激？或者你想要真实的东西？”

146
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,440
I believe it was only when they reached the point when they were ready to do anything that Jesus might ask:
我相信只有当他们准备好实践耶稣教导的任何事情时：

147
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,540
Forsake everything they owned, quit their jobs, leave their families,
放弃他们拥有的一切，辞掉工作，离开家人，

148
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,240
go into all the world, lay down their lives for Christ...
到全世界去，为基督舍命……

149
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,760
And then the blessing came. And who knows?
然后祝福就来了。谁知道呢？

150
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,620
Maybe it wasn't even emotional for some of them.
也许对他们中的一些人来说，这甚至不是情绪化的。

151
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,500
But they had sorted it out between them and God, right down to the last breath in their bodies.
但他们已经在他们和上帝之间解决了这个问题，直到他们身体的最后一口气。

152
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,140
Jesus, and all that he represented, meant more to them than life itself.
耶稣，以及他所代表的一切，对他们来说比生命本身更重要。

153
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:52,140
How can we even think to mention prayer without some understanding of what it is all leading to?
我们怎么可能想到要提到祷告而不了解它会导致什么？

154
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,220
Your heavenly Father wants to give his Holy Spirit to them that ask.
你的天父想要将他的圣灵赐给那些祈求的人。

155
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,760
But there are very few who ask, and even fewer who keep on asking until they get it.
但是很少有人求，更少的人会一直求直到他们得到它。

156
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,580
Nevertheless, that is what the father wills. And if we are to pray according to his will
尽管如此，这是父亲的意愿。如果我们要按照他的旨意祷告

157
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,080
then this is what we will ask for.
那么这就是我们所要求的。

158
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,100
In the verses before this passage, Jesus told them to say the Lord's Prayer:
在这段经文之前的经文中，耶稣告诉他们要念主祷文：

159
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,920
"Your kingdom come, your will be done..."
“愿你的国降临，愿你的旨意成就……”

160
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,320
Where is there mention of new cars or multi-million dollar jets in that prayer?
在那个祷告中，哪里提到了新车或价值数百万美元的喷气式飞机？

161
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,580
Where are the promotions and healings and worldly marks of success
升职、医治和世俗的成功标志在哪里？

162
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,720
in what Jesus tells us to pray for, in the Lord's Prayer?
在主祷文中，耶稣告诉我们要祈求什么？

163
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,480
When we want his kingdom more than life itself;
当我们想要他的国过于生命本身时；

164
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:47,660
When we want his spirit more than life itself; when we want his truth and love and faith more than life itself;
当我们想要他的灵胜过生命本身时；当我们想要他的真理、爱和信仰过于生命本身时；

165
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:54,280
Then, will he open the windows of heaven and pour out his true blessing on our lives.
然后，他会打开天堂的窗户，将他真正的祝福倾倒在我们的生活中。

166
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,420
Can we trust him for that?
我们可以信任他吗？

167
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,760
Can we let him decide what it is that will really make us happy?
我们可以让他决定什么才能真正让我们快乐吗？

168
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,540
Believe me, he does know what is best for each of us.
相信我，他确实知道什么对我们每个人都是最好的。

169
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,860
So let us ask, and let us keep on asking for more and more of his spirit.
所以让我们祈求，让我们继续祈求越来越多的他的属灵。

170
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,620
Your will be done.
你的旨意成就。

171
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,260
Your kingdom come, on earth, as it is in heaven.
你的国降临在地上，在地上，如同在天上一样。

172
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,200
For after all is said and done, heavenly father
所有的一切，被陈述并被完成，天父

173
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:27,720
yours is the kingdom, and yours is the power, and yours is the glory, for ever and ever.
国度是你的，权势是你的，荣耀是你的，直到永远。

174
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,420
Can we pray such a prayer?
我们可以作这样的祷告吗？

175
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,500
Amen.
阿门。
