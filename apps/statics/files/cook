Today is a new Sunday, and we saw the envelope of “the Feast of Harvest”, and there is a banner to show this information. I thought about a Chinese idiom said about those authorities set many reasons cleverly to get more money. And I thought of those religious leaders who were rebuked by Jesus the Lord, although they were religious leaders. They devour windows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Jesus said there men will be punished most severely.

Those who enjoyed wealth and authority in this world, most of them will be punished in the future, and the fulfillment of the word of the Lord always in a way that man does it by their own heart. The punishment maybe their own feeling of punishment because their former enjoyment lost.

In fact, I don’t know how to solve that printer problem, and also, I don’t know why that printer problem was solved, although it seems that it’s me solved that problem. I shall fear the Lord, it’s not me, it’s the spirit of the Lord did.

God is love, not policy but Love, the work of God should be supported by Love not the policy, although sometimes policy is more reliable than love. God is not a reliable one than money? Yes it is in our eyes, so there are just a few follow his way and enter his door. I thought above those when I saw the Korean church and think about how can my church sustained.

Maybe someone can’t understand how Jesus died for our sins, but it’s not important, the important thing is that we live in Jesus Christ and thus he can use his death as the finished real sacrifice before God to save our life.
