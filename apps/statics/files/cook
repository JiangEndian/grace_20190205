Hello, Dave. I'm very glad that you can admit there are many differences between us because of our different culture and experiences. 

Your word about Chinese churches is right, there is a recognised church and underground church, both of them are oppressed by the government. But if you read the book of Peter, you will find what you should say to those people who were persecuted. 

"1 Peter 2-13 Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme; 1 Peter 2-14 or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well."
subject服从的；受支配的 ordinance权威性命令；训令 supreme最高的 vengeance报仇，复仇，报复
ministers are subject to the laws of the land.
部长受国法管辖。subject服从的；受支配的 
Why do you try to let the believers attack the government? Do you think those believers have such power? Or do you want to kill them with the hand of the government? Your words give the government a pretext to attack those believers in China, but you are not in China, they cannot attack you right? Please be merciful to those believers who are under the power of government. Please read the letter of Peter, learn what you should say to the people in China. 

I agree with you that the first Christians practiced a communism life, and I  think that form can not succeed on the earth, we can not build a heavenly kingdom on the earth. But, the first Christian tried it, so I think we should try it again. Not to build such a heavenly kingdom on earth, but to receive the heavenly kingdom from above. 

Capitalism serves the money, but communism can succeed only in the true heavenly kingdom. We have no hope on earth, our hope is the heavenly kingdom, which comes from heaven. 

Here is my daily plan, so you can be patient if sometimes I cannot reply to you immediately. Morning: reading, thinking, writing a sermon about the word of God. Afternoon: preach that sermon, edit video and upload it. Evening: sometimes free, sometimes meeting. 

If I have some free time, I prefer to go out to preach the name of Jesus.  The word of God makes me very content. I love Him. Have a nice day. Sincerely, JiangFei
