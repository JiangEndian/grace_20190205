不能为了享乐啊。Fri 26 Mar 2021 12:16:35 AM KST ，想着再去找回那个写真的然后用来当背景好专注于刷alt3? 然后想想，我要来干什么呢？向着享乐吗？那不行。我不能是为了快乐。我得有目的。为了让我更好的吃菜我做的美味点。嗯。为了更好的刷alt3我来下载点当背景看？嗯。。。好像可行呢。。。
可是，父亲啊，如果是这样，为什么要我以前删除那些呢？找找看以前删除时的记录，把那个数据库下载下来，然后打开即可搜索看看了：算了，找不到了。。。Fri 26 Mar 2021 08:07:28 AM KST 
回应上个的，不用找了，是因为我不是因为满足欲望而幸福，而是因为没有欲望而幸福。因为欲望是不满足的。我如果满足了欲望，只能是越来越难以幸福。如果没有欲望，生活的点滴都是幸福。我不能够让我的幸福总量被她占据绝大多数。她不是一。他才是一。只来源于他才对的。但，富有时很难来源于他。会来源于她她她。假设她是200，吃饭是20，那么真是，她一下子把我的多巴胺受体降低至1/20，她就几乎成了我全部的幸福依靠了。不行。神给的大概30？反正不会让我们受体降低太多。反而是：【哈3:17】虽然无花果树不发旺，葡萄树不结果，橄榄树也不效力，田地不出粮食，圈中绝了羊，棚内也没有牛；
【哈3:18】然而，我要因耶和华欢欣，因救我的　神喜乐。
写个程序，多巴胺受体量，各样事物的多巴胺分泌量，回归函数使100或1趋向于正常10来决定受体量，以此来排序我天天想什么。是她，是黄片，是食物，还是，耶和华。加入life_code，正常每天吃饭喝水，查下那个量，然后正常的幸福感受为10，受体量为，然后大量冲击时幸福度提升受体量降低，效果降一半吧，直到幸福度为10正常的。受到不足量时，受体量提升，效果是提一半吧，最终是平常的。在配置里弄好，今天多受了多少量，少受了多少量，根据天数来计划幸福度和神位排序。
多巴胺-幸福度-排位，的变化，直接所有幸福度总加，不对，就是每天刺激的。嗯。没办法悔改了吗？过苦日子。多巴胺为负。对。一想到那些多巴胺就分泌。不是得到，是想要。得到时，多巴胺分泌。下次直接预期得到开始分泌使人想要。就是想想下边就分泌的一样。效果一样的。对，耶稣也说，动淫念和犯奸淫一样。。。确实是一样的从本质上来说。想一想，就和得到的一样开始分泌多巴胺了。这个多巴胺使人开始渴望驱动人。然后人若顺从驱动力更加想，更加分泌，更加渴望，直到，没有直到，地狱是没有底的。。。所以不开始想，是最好抵挡的。
先快速分析希伯来语，然后配置页面设计新加输入，对象们，想到或得到的时间积累总量，对比昨天的受体量产生今天的幸福度并对比昨天的幸福度修正今天的受体量，排序今天的对象们谁在先后。悔改，每一天。
想就等于得到一半，越想就越接近得到，那父母想孩子呢？嗯，应该是有另一种没得到的吧，就是父母与孩子接触而产生的内腓态。嗯。我要常常与耶稣，神的话语接触。
有朋友评论说，人是会变的。（关于某人和另一人结婚后希望觉得对方能改掉那些之前的习惯。。。其实我觉得说的没错，基因是能突变的。。。但还是，爱，就是包容忍耐吧。）

算了，后悔不算晚。悔改嘛。。。Fri 26 Mar 2021 08:35:18 AM KST ，去写多巴胺排序人生的程序，写着搜索着资料，发现有点搞不定了。太复杂了。。。也是，那人体调节，多复杂啊。。。就不写了。然后觉得那些资料挺有意思，准备粘贴下。

含有咖啡因的饮料可以增加多巴胺。全世界有数十亿人以咖啡，茶或其他含咖啡因的饮料开始新的一天。咖啡因通过刺激多巴胺的释放和增加多巴胺受体的可用性，因此让你感觉更加清醒和灵敏。（不好。。。会让人依赖这个，而不是神的话语。。。反正让人更加幸福的其他东西不好。降低受体的也不好。）（但上帝也给人食物，给人享受啊？耶利米书 22-15 难道你作王是在乎造香柏木楼房争胜吗？你的父亲岂不是也吃、也喝，也施行公平和公义吗？那时他得了福乐。耶利米书 22-16 他为困苦和穷乏人伸冤，那时就得了福乐。认识我不在乎此吗？这是耶和华说的。认识他就是这样的福乐。嗯。。。应该是，知道这一切，是父亲给的。因父亲而得的。嗯。我是因父亲而得的。我不要去拜金，我要去拜赐予金的父亲。）
但咖啡因并不是唯一能增强多巴胺的化合物， 还有茶氨酸——一种茶类独有的氨基酸，黑茶，白茶，乌龙茶和绿茶等各种茶类均含有茶氨酸。与咖啡因不同，茶氨酸会引起放松状态。它很容易穿过血脑屏障，增加多巴胺以及血清素和GABA的脑平 。因此，茶氨酸也可作为补充剂。
为了增加多巴胺，你应该尽量避免食用以下食物：避免脂肪。在动物脂肪和棕榈油中发现的大量饱和脂肪会降低多巴胺受体的敏感性。（不让以色列人吃，免得他们的受体降低，也降低上帝的地位。）
避免糖。糖被认为可以促进多巴胺，但这是一种暂时的，不健康的促进剂，比食物更像药物，最终会导致多巴胺缺乏症 。（生活太甜了不好，上帝给的是吗哪。。。）
避免人造甜味剂。阿斯巴甜会降低大脑中多巴胺以及血清素的水平，血清素是另一种重要的促进情绪的神经递质 。（生活太甜了不好，上帝给的是吗哪。。。）
避免过量进食。限制进食物量会增加多巴胺受体的数量，也就是我们平时说的饭吃七八分饱，少吃对增加多巴胺是有帮助的 。（生活太幸福了不好，上帝占据的位置就会降低。。。）
体育锻炼是你可以为大脑做的最好的事情之一。它可以促进新脑细胞的产生，减缓脑细胞衰老，并改善大脑营养物质的流动。可以帮助您应对压力情况。
运动通过促进新脑细胞受体的生长，可以提高多巴胺的基线水平。如果你可以在户外锻炼，那就更好了。阳光能增加多巴胺受体的数量，并产生维生素D，从而激活释放多巴胺的基因。
听音乐会导致多巴胺的释放。脑部扫描显示，在听，创造或播放音乐时，大脑的愉悦中心会亮起来。奇怪的是，你甚至不需要听音乐来让这种神经递质流动，你只需要期待、只是期待听音乐，就可以做到这一点。
你有没有听过一段让你发冷的音乐？这种感觉与显著的多巴胺增强有关。
通过触摸和社交联系促进多巴胺          各种愉悦的触摸能增加多巴胺。
a.治疗性按摩使多巴胺增加31％，同时会一定量减少应激激素皮质醇。 b.拥抱引发一系列有益的大脑化学物质，包括多巴胺，催产素和血清素。 c.抚摸你的狗可以给你和你的宠物增加多巴胺和一些其他感觉良好的大脑化学物质。d.有证据表明，当实验室动物被挠痒或者有性生活时，它们体内会增加多巴胺，但尚未在人类身上得到证实。（挠痒和性没用。我不是动物，我是神的形象） e.日常并不会一直有按摩或合适的拥抱机会，但仅简单地与他人积极社交就会增加多巴胺 – 不需要身体接触。（啊，真好。能拥抱或按摩很好。不能的话就是简单的和人对话就行。）
获得充足的睡眠是您可以为大脑健康和身体健康做的最重要的事情之一。研究发现，多巴胺在睡眠调节中的作用比以前认为的要大。它控制睡眠激素——褪黑激素的产生。睡眠不足可能会减少多巴胺受体的数量，一夜无眠甚至会导致多巴胺受体的下调。
肥胖与多巴胺功能障碍之间存在密切联系。有趣的是，肥胖者的多巴胺受体比普通人要多。事实上，他们的大脑与食物的关系很像吸毒成瘾者。由于多巴胺负责大脑的快乐中心，肥胖的人通过进食获得的乐趣和满足感更少，迫使他们多吃。
洗个冷水澡。在14°C 的水中淋浴可以大幅增加多巴胺 – 高达2.5倍！如果你不能做到这一点，至少要以在最后以一阵冷水喷射结束你的洗澡。你可以去问问冷水浴的坚持者，冷水浴是否可以帮助提升他们一整天的情绪和生产力，甚至比喝咖啡还要管用。
（洗过冬天冷水澡的人表示太认可了。。。）
伸着脸，越过讨人喜欢的年轻小姑娘也要把脸伸过去和会长说话。和朋友们一起吃太花时间就只顾自己吃。变着花样和会长套近乎。嗯。。。啊。。。人生啊。。。基本上多烂的东西都会有人要，但非常贵的产品那就得筛选掉，嗯。。。原来如此。。。筛选掉一些人，和另一些人套近乎。。。也是啊，要和人交易的，只能是如此。除非，只是想给予的。。。给予者啊，自己会一无所有的。像是时间，就给予了别人或者陪伴了一起。。。只有像我这样的索取者，才会在索取不到的时候，愤愤不平。。。我只想给予。嗯。他他他不要，会有非常多的人需要的。嗯。。。Fri 26 Mar 2021 09:43:42 AM KST ，今天拿出了平板，打开了kakao，没看到之前的信息，只看到了昨天的，可能之前的丢了吧。然后看到的就是姑娘伸着脸向人热情的。。。
啊，我兄约拿单的爱情，岂是那些妇女的爱情能比得上的。呵。
宋美龄活了106岁，知道为什么吗？原因之一是护士按摩（为什么有的人很坏，但是命很好？）
有一个姓郭的女副官，专门负责给她按摩，不是按摩一小时哦，是整夜不休地按，因为只要停止，宋美龄就睡不着，导致郭副官双臂落下残疾（其实是这样的，只有吃了别人，自己才能肥壮。换成羊就是，为什么有的羊很恶，还很肥壮？就是因为恶才能肥壮。。。耶稣就命不好，把自己的命都给了别人，那自己哪还能命好。甚至连命都没了。。。）
郭副官可以选择辞职，可为什么不呢，因为有别的可图，或者被别的东西挟持了，世上很多事情其实是交易，交易本身没道德感的
后来宋美龄去美国的时候这个副官不愿跟着去继续服务，还被骂忘恩负义，连同她的孩子在学校也被欺负（其实对的吧。假如，没有宁美龄，副官可能就早已死了，那现在，只是双臂残废，不算什么其实。嗯。对，就像，失去双手双脚进天国，比完整的下地狱要好，耶稣就是这样教导的。她只是双手残废的活着这许多年，这不比完整的早就死了好多了吗。。。她只是顺服忠贞的干净着，这不比臣服淫乱的肮脏着好多了吗。而且，她所顺服的对象啊，不只是被动的，有力量可怕的-也因此才能击杀要击杀我们的有力量者拯救出我们，也是主动的，有爱心可爱的。）
啊这个我知道！因为她一换人就会醒，就是说按摩不能中断，然后后来有人给她推荐按摩仪，但是那个按摩仪需要绑在郭副官的手臂上使用，所以一晚上下来，郭副官的手臂就很疼。然后后来郭副官要离开她，她还骂郭副官不仁不义啥的，反正骂的很难听，最后郭副官结局很不好，唉😔
（牺牲自己。其实自己也早就死了不然。。。如果对方只有力量，没有爱，那不过是换种悲惨罢了。人活着，不是牛。就算是牛，也得对他有仁慈的。人活着，被拯救了，不是说就能毫无私欲的只为拯救者活了。就算是牛，完全是主人的物品，也是，打场的时候不能勒住嘴不让他吃的。就算完全是拯救者的物品，牛也是有自己的私欲的，拯救者也是要有对应的仁慈的。如果没有呢？牛需要祷告仁慈的拯救者拯救自己脱离这个压迫者。。。就像物品被买卖，买家付出代价作为拯救者如果不爱惜，那就真的是。。。但还好，我所遇到的拯救者都挺爱惜我的。。。感谢天父，我的拯救者，是你。是你的形象。）（被拯救者也是，要有对应的所属意识。基本的牛打场时吃东西的私欲之外的，都是属于主人的。自己也是属于主人的。）（但今天，神的形象们，一个又一个，只能是一部分又一部分了。嗯。。。）
这是十字架七言之一。今日你要同我在乐园里了。这是耶稣对其中一个和他同钉的相信悔改的强盗说的。

这是一个伟大的真理，today's salvation. 我们得救不是因为行为，只是因着信耶稣基督。

地狱是不得安宁的地方。一点盼望也都没有的地方。无底坑的地方，干渴的地方。天堂是安息的地方。充满光明的地方。

真正敬拜神的人都知道得胜在乎耶和华。所以大卫带领百姓在神面前敬拜，交托。

救恩是出于神。能否得胜，完全掌握在神的手里。

我们也会有没有胜算的战争。但我们的神我们的旌旗，是我们得胜的保障。我们要敬拜我们的神。宣扬他的话语。

大卫在战争中坚定的原因，内心强大的原因，来自于他对神的信心。战争胜利之后，必有收获和安息。

我们的指望不在于人而在于神，我们才能对人也有感恩感谢。我们的指望全在神，就没有失望担心，反而是感谢感动。聚焦神的形象。

她在温室里讲的道，我觉得不实在。我在风雨中经历的道，她觉得太极端。嗯。神赐给她温室，赐给我风雨，自然，没有办法的。。。但还好，风雨中的，温室里的，神都有的用。神的家大，各样器皿都有。感谢神。Mar 26, 2021 12:21:25 PM，听孔传道讲道觉得不实在。想着我的道被人看为极端思想。。。很多人都说不正常。。。好吧，想法和正常人不一样。。。













주제: 하루 한끼 안식 된다.

우리 엄마, 잘 지내셨어요? 

어제 일요일에 원장목사님의 무리로 성도들이 다 소리없이 행동으로 화를 냈어요. 
오후 2시 반 예배중에, 설교전에 큐즈가 있어요. 하지만 원장목사님이 자기만 말하고 "이런 말을 하려고 하는 성도들이 손들어 줘라"고 했어요. 한 시간 반 동안 그랬어요. 그리고 설교 하기를 시작했어요. 
설교를 위한 기도를 하고, 목사님이 밑을 보고 좀 불안한 것 같아요. 그래서 "한 시간반 큐즈가 했어 시간이 다 된다"고 하고 또 다시 마무리 기도를 하고 축도를 했어요. 축도 마치자 마자 다들 일어나서 밖에 나갔어요. 
목사님이 혼자 강단위에 서서 광고하는 것이 조금 이상해요. 빨리 마치고 밖에 나가서 성도들을 배웅했어요. 

제가 요새 매일 한끼 먹게 되었어요. 배고픈 일이 있지만 제 인생은 배불러하기 위해 온 것이 아니잖아요. 그리고 제가 요새 매일 9시쯤에 자요. 즐길 것이 많지만 안식은 제일 좋아요. 

좋은 것을 다 가지고 싶은 것이 우리 모두의 본성이에요. 우리 하나님은 좋은 것을 창조하고 "심히 좋다"고 하고 안식하셨어요. 
이 시대의 젊은이 들이 거의 안식을 두려워해요. 심야 까지 즐기고 쉬는 것을 원치 않아요. 고통이나 기쁨이나 다 힘든 것이에요. 그 무엇보다 안식은 영원한 생명이에요. 

나와 우리 엄마, 다 주님안에서 안식을 얻을 수 있도록 우리 주님이 은혜내려 주시길 원해요. 


주제: 송구영신.

우리엄마, 잘 지내셨어요? 



오래 동안 엄마한테 편지를 안 보냈어요. 하지만 엄마의 생각이 항상 내 머리 안에 있어요. 엄마를 그리워해요. 



교회에서 있으니까 매일 4시반쯤에 일어나요. 그래서 4시반쯤에 일어날 수 있도록 항상 9시쯤에 자요. 

그리고 교회에서 이런저런 일이 있어서 낮잠을 안자요. 때론 새벽기도한 후 더 자요. 



매일 한끼씩 먹는 것은 진짜로 효과가 있어요. 내 무거운 몸이 가벼워질 수 있어요. 

하지만 그런 것도 쉽지 않아요. 때론 점심때 어떤 사람이 오게 되면 다 같이 먹어야 돼서 하루 두끼나 심지어 세끼 먹게 돼요. 게다가 원장목사님이 그저께 내게 양념 소고기를 사주셔서 엄청난 유혹을 당해야 돼요. 제가 유혹 앞에서 항상 실패해요. 



오늘 점심 같이 먹은 후, 제가 서표를 자르면서 목사님의 전화를 들었어요. 원장목사님이 다른 목사님이랑 통화할 때 이선생님을 대해 많이 비평했어요. 

그리고 제가 듣고 교훈을 받았어요. 그분이 이 선생님을 비평하면서 나를 징계하는 것 같아요. 



오늘 여기 수도관이 얼어붙여서 하루종일 온수가 없어요. 그래서 아까 제가 주방에서 뜨거운 물을 받고 화장실에서 머리를 감았어요. 



조금 이따가 11시에 송구영신 예배가 있어요. 

지난간 일년에 하나님이 우리에게 은혜를 주셔서 감사해요. 그리고 새로운 일년에 하나님이 계속계속 우리를 지켜주시고 보호하시길 원해요.

summary of the book called "DaQinJingJiaoLiuXingBei".

Summary of chapter three: GuangZhou, the opening door of Qing dynasty and the Acts of China. 

GuangZhou and QuanZhou are other     gate for the missionaries of China. Although the seed of gospel has rooted in China from the Tang dynasty,    went by the Yuang, Ming, Qing, but cannot root in China thoroughly. Thus missionaries of Protestantism knocked the door of China in the Ming and Qing dynasty through Macao and GuangZhou, which was     trade gate of China because of the well developed waterway. 

GuangZhou was     a important trading port of     waterway from the Tang dynasty, however in the Yuan dynasty, QuanZhou was the main trading port, and GuangZhou was the supplementary trading port. 

QuanZhou attracted many merchants from abroad and inland, because of the opening policy of the Yuan dynasty, there are many temples of many religions were built here, and in the 20th century, there are many monuments were excavated here. Those monuments were "the cross of QuanZhou". 

There are protestant missionaries     came into China in the period of Opium-war, which was waged by England because of their business affairs. In the 19th century, many silvers of England flowed into China mainland because of the trading between England and China. Thus they want to retrieve their silver and     made opium to sell to Chinese. However the Qing dynasty rejected opium and forbade it     duo to the profound social problem     occurred with opium, so the armies of England waged the Opium-war,    opened the door of the closed Qing dynasty. Because of this, those protestant missionaries have the chance to get into the mainland of China. 

Met by war not      peaceful way, there are many hostilities between western world and China. Although Christianity was preached again in China because of the coming of the missionaries from the western world, there were many suspects and doubts against those missionaries, such as thinking them as spies or dogs of the western world. But those missionaries breathed with lower classes and did the works of education and medicine, they also held the Enlightenment campaign to oppose opium. Different     with the Catholic which preached gospel from the Tang dynasty by the way from upper classes to lower classes, the protestant missionaries preached gospel from the bottom of society to the upper classes. 

The first protestant missionary from western world was Robert Morrison, he came into China mainland and stayed in China mainland for 27 years and       done many works for Chinese, especially the translation work of Chinese Bible and the Chinese-English dictionary. Also he built      church, school and hospital for Chinese. 

Morrison was born in 1782, January, and became a pastor in 1807, then he was sent to preach gospel in       China mainland, his work included Bible translation and dictionary compiling. Although he    was want to get into China by the boat of the East India company, he   can't   got a permission and was rejected for some reasons. Then he decided to go to China by the cargo boat of America. He departed from England to New York, and      take a cargo boat from New York to China. When he was asked about whether he can heal the idolatry of Chinese, he replied that he can't but he believes God can do it. Thus Morrison arrived at GuangZhou in 1807, and when he   was went by Macao, he said, "OH, The biggest nation of the earth, the nation of stone, when will you open your door?" 

After Morrison arrived      at China, he studied Chinese from 2 Chinese Catholic secretively, for it was forbidden to teach foreigners Chinese. Morrison didn't receive any support from Mission Union and solved all problems by himself, he was a tentmaker missionary. Morrison had worked in     East India company for the message of this company which       maybe used in his missions. 

The result of his efforts were the book of Acts of Chinese version in 1810 and the New Testament of Chinese version, and a baptized christian who was called CaoGao. In 1815, Morrison published the Chinese Monthly Magazine with the help of William Milne, who       was came from the Mission Union of London in 1812 to help Morrison. In 1816, Morrison       send away the Chinese Bible to Korea by an English explorer. In the same year, Morrison baptized a Chinese worker who was called LiangFa, in the printing office. Morrison and Milne finished their translation work in 1819, the whole Bible was translated by Chinese. In 1823, Morrison baptized LiangFa's son who was named LiangJinde, and LiangFa became the first Chinese christian missionary. 

Morrison        backed to London in 1824, to present the King of England the Bible of Chinese Version and the map of BeiJing, and he became a member of the Asian Academic Union. Morrison came to China again in 1826, LiangFa worked as an assistant of Morrison,         concentrate on mission and writing. The book of LiangFa called "QuanShiLiangYan" influenced HongXiuquan a lot, who was the leader of the "TaiPing Heavenly Kingdom" movement. Morrison sent         an letter to ask support for        China Mission and thus many missionaries came to China from America,        famous one of them was the pastor Elijah Coleman Bridgman, who devoted his whole life to China. Bridgman studied Chinese from Morrison and taught English to LiangFa's son, LiangJinde. 

Morrison and Bridgman reported their mission and asked support by sending letters to many churches of Europe and America in 1832. Morrison left the world because of sickness on August 1, 1834, in GuangZhou. 

When we talk about the leading missionaries such as Morrison, there is a man we can't omit, Karl Friedrich August Gutzlaff, a German missionary. Gutzlaff was a Lutheran, he decided to do abroad missions in 1818, age 15. In 1826, he graduated from Netherlands missionary school and became a pastor of Lutheran Church, was sent to Java as a missionary in the next year. There were many Chinese         lived in Java too, thus Gutzlaff studied Chinese from those residents, and had a dream of       China Mission. 

Gutzlaff arrived at Siam Bangkok in 1828 with missionary Jacob Tomlin, in where more than half of       it's resident's were Chinese, thus he studied       FuJiang and         GuandDong language to prepare for the China Mission. The first missionary travel of Gutzlaff was in 1831, cost 6 months, by a Junk Ship of his Chinese friend. In 1832 and 1833, he started his second and third missionary         travel from Macao. His fourth missionary travel was in 1833, by the boat called John Bigger to QuanZhou, fifth missionary travel was in the same year by the boat called Colony Young to FuJiang, and backed to Macao on March 24, 1834. He did the work of translation and writing in Macao. 

One notion of Gutzlaff is that "Chinese should bear their own mission", and thus he organized       a inland missionary union called The Chinese Union. There were 22 members in this union, and all of them were Chinese except Gutzlaff. Of course there were some problems in this union, and after the      dead of Gutzlaff        on August 1851, the union       was died too. On his gravestone, "First apostle of modern China" was inscribed. 

Because of the efforts of those missionaries, including those Chinese missionaries such as CaoGao, LiangFa, and LiangJinde, the gospel rooted deeply in China mainland, and there are many famous Chinese       pastor occurred in the history. 

Shong Shangjie was a famous figure called "Paul of China ", born in 1901,       FuJiang province, as a son of       pastor. After he graduated from university with a flying grade, he entered the graduate school and got a master degree and finally got a doctor degree in 1926. However, to study theology, he rejected all lure and entered Union Theological Seminary. 

Shong Shangjie read         Bible 40 times when he was captured in psychiatric hospital because of his unusual behavior, and in that period he had special experience which let him to devote his life to preach the gospel. After he escaped from psychiatric hospital with the help of his friend and Chinese embassy, he         backed to China, and he threw away all his certifications and diplomas into the sea, like Paul, to throw away all honors of this world and just preach the gospel. He preached gospel in China for 15 years and scholars divided his activities as 5 sections. When he was living, he read       Bible and      pray for several hours everyday, and        fall on his knees to wait       the revelation of God       in night. That's the source of his great power. 

Another famous figure was       YangXinfei, a musical missionary, was born in 1928, as a daughter of        pastor, she devoted her whole life to God and never married, that's her promise with God. After the establishment of         People's Republic of China, her life became harder, however she still made         grate improvement in the area of music and became a teaching assistant after she        graduate. To keep the promise with God, she         backed to her hometown XiaMen to live a life as a missionary. Although she      sicked in 2004, which caused her to live with wheel-chair, she still kept her promise with God,         acted as a "wheel-chair missionary". 

One other was LinXiangao, who was born in 1924, Macao, in a christian family, and baptized in 1936 in Hong Kong. The name of LinXiangao means "offering lamb to Christ," and thus his English name was "Samuel Lamb". He started his mission in 1945 and had a         grate influence in China. He died in 2013 because of sickness, age 90. 

Through the missionary history of modern China, we can find that although China still needs foreign missionaries, the missionaries of Chinese are becoming more and more than before. In the first time when Christianity came into China, there        are no other ways but preaching gospel by those foreign missionaries through         translator, however along with the rooted gospel       become stronger, more Chinese missionaries occurred. 

Gospel will thrive in good soil, although the        heart land of Chinese seems hard to root, there are many people who were chosen and were kept by God, to those people,         gospel will be preached easily and root well. A big stone in the soil of China is that the religion of Christianity was coming from western world, who had invaded China in history. Because of this big stone, the most part of        China mainland don't have enough        place to let the gospel thrive, this stone of invader oppressed Chinese in the mainland of China, and nowadays, this stone of invader oppressed gospel in the        heart land of Chinese. Somewhere is roadside, somewhere is rocky ground, somewhere is thorn land, somewhere is good soil. Unfortunately, we can't choose which soil we will be, like nationality when we were born. However fortunately, we can't choose which soil we will be, good soil is not his own cultivator. The grace of God is sufficient for his people. הָלֶלוּיָה.

妈妈爱我真是纯洁啊。Mar 26, 2021 10:32:05 AM，想到之前她抱我我动手行恶。然后后来在旅店，她是那么的单纯的爱着儿子，就是儿子的喜欢着。直到后来，我动手刺激了她的服从罪的律的身体。那时我完全的信任她，也确实像个儿子，被动的接受着爱，不刺激对方。就那样贴着。她是真纯洁啊。我当时是完全的信任对方了，在这样的信任中，她不伤害我，不夺取我一切，说那个不能给她。
当时我是真信任啊。也对，当天下午还看打印的复习的课程呢。嘿。真单纯。单纯配单纯，没有肮脏。真好。就那样肌肤贴着亲下。互相不刺激。只是单纯的爱着。她那样单纯的爱着儿子。我那样单纯的恋慕母亲。啊。真好。直到后来，我开始冒犯，不对，一开始就是我冒犯。唉。我是个羞耻的儿子。（穿上遮住羞耻吧。悔改吧。清洁完羞耻的肮脏，遮住羞耻。没有可得性。在限制中，自由。母子关系，肌肤相触的量。我这已经是偏多的量了。不要质变了。已经够多了。母子之情，已然足够。父亲在上，敬畏信靠。）
