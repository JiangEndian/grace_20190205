아들이 엄마 아빠의 사랑을 간증했어요. 꿈에서 하는 것이지만...

아빠는 아들때문에 엄마에게 관심을 더 많이 주고, 엄마는 아들때문에 아빠의 사랑을 더 많이 생각하는 것은, 바로 아들의 쓸모라고 생각한다.

전화번호는 필요없어요. 내가 갈 수 있으니까.

필요할 때, 불러주세요. 내가 성천교회에서 은혜를 많이 받거든요.

3년동안 엠마오에 있어서 돈 안내고 공부하고 자고 먹고 하는 것은 큰 은혜에요.

이제 수업을 받아야 돼요. 필요하면 이번주 금요일에 또 갈게요. 아무튼 내가 은혜를 너무 많이 받아서요.

오후에 내가 마트에 가서 먹을 것 좀 사야 돼요. 금요일에 가면 내일 모래의 것 사면 돼요. 아니면 이번주 먹을 것 사요. 그래서 엄마가 결정하세요.

아니요, 선교사님께서 결정하세요.

네. 알겠습니다. 다음주 금요일에 만나자.

우리 엄마, 이제 제가 나가서 마트에 갈래요. 교실에 지나고 아이패드를 교실에 놔둘래요.

네. 다음주 금요일까지 먹을 수 있는 것 사왔어요.

교실에 왔어 아이패드로 메모해야 돼서 아이패드를 켤 수 있어요.

그리고 내 고향집 하고 자주 연락하지 마세요. 나 자신도 자주 연락하지 않는데요.

지금 엄청 졸려요. 수업 빨리 끝나면 좋겠어요.

내일 엄마의 시무일이니까 오늘 잘 쉬세요.

내 아들.수업중에 졸리다고 카톡하고 수업에 집중하지 않구나.

엄마는 어제 목사님들 모임에 참석하고 주방 봉사는 면했다

오늘은 새벽기도 끝나고 실컷 잤다

지금은 빨래하고 부엌에 설거지를 하려한다

교수님이 말씀하신 것 재미없어서 엄마의 생각을 좀 해야 돼요.

내일 기대되네요. 우리 엄마 하나님 아버지의 일에 참여하는 것은 영광입니다.

특별한것 없다. 그냥 평상시와 같이 하면 돼.

응. 우리 엄마의 평상시라도 하나님 아버지를 위해 살아있는 삶입니다.

목사님 밭에 왔다.엄마도 나가 본다.(미소)

이제 수업끝나고 돌아가야 돼요. 아이패드를 교실에 놔둬요. 낮에만 엄마와 연락해요. 밤에는 우리 주님안에서 안식해야 돼요.









오늘 점심 우리가 김밥을 만들고 먹었어요. 그리고 내가 밥솥 없기 때문에 남은 두개 김밥과 쌀밥을 조금 담아갔어요. 

쌀밥을 담은 봉지없어서 그래서 냄비로 담고 나갔어요. 엘리베이터앞에 누나들을 만났어요. 거지와 같다고 했어요. 내가 휴지로 냄비를 덮으려고 해서 화장실에 갔어요. 나와서 엘리베이터로 가고 엘리베이터 앞에 가게 될 때, 엘리베이터의 문의 틈이 천천히 닫히고 내려갔어요. 

처음 당한 일이 아니라서 그래서 그저 친구의 냉담함으로 생각해요. 좀 이따가 "거지와 같다"는 말이 생각났어요. "나와 같이 있으면 그들의 체면을 깎을 수 있다"는 생각이 들어왔어요. 그러군요. 
자세히 생각해 보니까, 우리 엄마도 내 너덜너덜하는 가방이나 신발을 안 좋아요. 엄마의 체면을 깎을 수 있어요. 이렇게 창피한 나를 누구든지 혐오해요. 

나를 혐오하는 것은 같지만 창피한 내게 대한 반응이 완전히 달라요. 
그들이 창피한 나를 버리고 우리 엄마는 내 창피한 것을 바꿔주셨어요. 

이 돈이 주장하는 세상에서 누구나 돈을 따라가요. 돈이 없는 자는 예수님이라도 그들이 혐오해요. 
마태복음서 25-40 ... 내 형제 중에 지극히 작은 자 하나에게 한 것이 곧 내게 한 것이니라
마태복음서 25-45 ... 이 지극히 작은 자 하나에게 하지 아니한 것이 곧 내게 하지 아니한 것이니라

메시아를 기다리는 이스라엘 사람들이 그들이 기대하는 메시아를 죽일 수 있는 것 같이, 오늘도 예수님을 사랑하는 자들이 그들이 믿고 사랑하는 예수님을 혐오할 수 있는 것이에요. 
아마 예수님을 믿는 부한 그들의 생각에는 예수님이 주릴 수 없고, 목마를 수 없으며, 벗을 수 없고 병들 수 없으며, 옥에 갇힐 수도 없는 것 같아요. 그들이 이렇게 잘 사는데 그들이 믿는 예수님이 당연히 그들보다 더 잘 살아야 돼요. 예수님이 저렇게 처참하게 지낼 리가 없어요. 

예수님이 우리를 위해 고난을 당해서야 우리가 오늘처럼 행복하게 살 수 있어요. 
그리고 우리가 고난 당한 예수님을 혐오해요. 왜 이렇게 창피하냐고 싫어해요. 우리는 볼 수 없는 고난 당하고 창피한 주님을 "주여 주여" 힘세게 외쳐요. 볼 수 있는 창피한 자를 싫어해요. 우리에게 있는 행복함은 다 주님의 고난이에요. 고난 당하신 주님께 감사해요. 고난주간 우리가 주님의 고난을 기억해요. 

우리가 믿고 또 사랑하는 메시아는 바로 이스라엘 사람들이 기대하는 메시아에요. 우리가 기대하는 메시아를 만날 때도 이스라엘 백성처럼 반응해요. 
우리의 도움이 필요하는 예수님을 우리가 어떻게 사랑해요? 우리보다 더 못한 예수님을 우리가 어떻게 사랑할 수 있어요? 예수님이 일단 재물의 힘을 빌리고 재물로 자기를 치장한 후에야 우리가 그분을 사랑할 수 있어요. 

누가 화려한 성전을 안 좋아해요? 누가 초라한 구유를 좋아할 수 있어요? 생색을 낼 수 있는 화려한 성전이 당연히 창피한 구유보다 더 좋아요. 
구유에 누워있는 구주님이 진짜로 창피해요. 우리의 체면을 깎을 수 밖에 없어요. 그분이 그의 왕위에 올라간 후 우리가 그분을 사랑해요. 다행이 오늘날에 예수님이 이미 그의 왕위에 올라갔어요. 우리가 우리 왕이신 예수님을 사랑해요. 

왕위 아닌 구유에 누워있는 예수님이 누가 좋아요? 영광아닌 너덜너덜한 옷을, 아니, 강보를 입은 예수님이 누가 좋아요? 우리가 왜 외모적으로 예수님을 판단해요? 심지어 우리가 그분을 십자가위에 죽였어요. 우리의 체면을 깎는 예수. 
예수님과 동행하는 것은 우리의 체면을 깎을 수 있으면 우리가 예수님을 피할 수 밖에 없어요. 우리가 보기에 아주 못된 예수님을 사랑할 수 있는 자가 어디 있겠어요? 

요한계시록 1-7 볼찌어다 구름을 타고 오시리라 각인의 눈이 그를 보겠고 그를 찌른 자들도 볼터이요 
이 예언이 오늘날까지 이루어지지 않아요. 예수님이 죽으신지 거의 2000년이 되어지만 이 영광스러운 강림이 아직도 없어요. 

창피한 자를 혐오하는 사람은 두가지 반응이 있어요. 피하는 것과 도와주는 것. 
내가는 창피한 자와 같이 창피한 자가 되기를 원해요. 내가 예수님이 창피한 자가 아닌 것을 믿어요. 아무리 창피해 보여도. 

로마서 9-33 ... 저를 믿는 자는 부끄러움을 당치 아니하리라 ...
내가 그의 말을 믿습니다. 그분이 내 부끄러움을 벗어주실 그 날이 오시길 원해요. 

그분의 부끄러움에 참여하는 자들이 그분이 영광중에 강림하시는 날을 소망해요. 
창피한 그분이 영광스러운 하나님의 아들이라는 것을 내가 믿어요. 지금 창피한 내 주님이 빨리 영광스러운 자가 되기를 원해요. 

창피한 요셉이 영광스러운 자 된 것 같이 창피한 내 주님이 영광스러운 자가 될 수 있는 줄 믿어요. 
내가 원하는 것은 그저 그 날이 빨리 오신 것이에요. 빨리하는 것은 없어요. 다행히 더디하는 것도 없어요. 

이 세상에서 사는 동안 주님의 날을 소망하면서 살아갈 수 있기를 원해요. 주님의 날이 오시길 기대해요. 








Summary of chapter four: WenZhou, walk through the churches' remains in China mainland's Jerusalem. 

WenZhou is a special city which was specialized with Christianity culture. The first missionary of WenZhou was Josiah Alexander Jackson and George Stott, they came to WenZhou and started their missions in November, 1867. Stott became a Protestant believer when he was in a hospital, because of his maimed left leg. He decided to become a missionary of China when he got to know the necessity of preaching the gospel in China. Stott built the first Christian church of WenZhou on April 1, 1877, moreover Stott and his wife built the first women's school in WenZhou. 

The first Methodist Church of WenZhou was built by pastor R. Inkermann Exly in 1878. After pastor Inkermann, William Edward Soothill and his wife came to WenZhou in November, 1883, and did great things for WenZhou, even for China. 

Soothill played a great role in the process of making WenZhou to be China's Jerusalem. Soothill arrived at WenZhou when he was 22 years old, with his flancee Lucy Farrar Soothill, after they came into WenZhou, they studied WenZhou language for 6 months, and then they preached the Gospel. Soothill and his wife had done many things for WenZhou, but they were attacked in a anti-Christianity movement on October 4, 1884. When he and his 30 believers were worshiping, a part of mobs intruded into his worship place and started to throw stones, the mobs destroyed his house, his school, and his churches. 

To restore his hospital Soothill invited many physicians, a man named John Ding Ley came to WenZhou and built the DingLey Hospital. DingLey Hospital was the first western hospital, and the name was changed to BaiLeiDe Hospital in 1906, and the name was changed again in 1949 to WenZhou Second Hospital. 

In 1893, Soothill translated the New Testament with WenZhou language, he built the first high school in the autumn of the same year, his wife built a woman's high school in 1905. In 1911, Soothill asked for support to build a college when he went back to England, but his plan was broken due to the first world war from 1914 to 1918. But his wife built a woman's middle school in Beijing. Soothill became a professor of Chinese Culture in Oxford in 1920, and wrote many books about Chinese culture. Soothill died on May 14, 1935, in Oxford, and was buried in Oxford, he had lived in WenZhou for 25 years, and built more than 150 churches, and preached Jesus to more than 10,000 people. His life was devoted to WenZhou and China thoroughly. 

After Soothill finished his work in 1911 and returned to England, J. W. Heywood pastor continued his work. He proclaimed that the Chinese Church should support itself, and he got much support from the immediate areas. He encouraged believers to have their religious life, furthermore, he stressed the financial foundation and worker cultivation. In this period, WenZhou's churches grew quickly. 

After pastor Soothill and Heywood, the head pastor of ChongXiTang is the missionary Scott, and after Scott went back to England, Pastor W. B. Ayoltt continued their work. In August, 1936, "Christianity κοινωνια", also called "Oxford κοινωνια" , started in ChongXiTang. Moreover, they started religious education for believers. But in 1958, the China government decided to expand the Three-self patriotic movement and want to make all China churches to be the same one under the same rule, same system, and same institution. 

With the Great Cultural Revolution, ChongXiTang was destroyed, and the leaders of churches were criticized, the activities of churches were forbidden. However, after the Great Culture Revolution, the number of Christian in WenZhou recovered to an amazing size. Although WenZhou churches have their own problems such as they are a small part just for WenZhou people, the effect of WenZhou churches affected the whole China mainland. As WenZhou was called China's Jerusalem, the people of WenZhou were called China's Jews. The mode of WenZhou churches were studied throughout the China mainland. 

I have gone to WenZhou twice before I came to Korea, what I have seen in WenZhou churches made me amazed when I first went to WenZhou. Different from my hometown's church, WenZhou's church is more shining, and their sermon talked about money offering openly. I think that's the secret of WenZhou churches' success. As their nickname, "China's Jews", they grasp God and money together, they serve God more by their money, and they get more money by their religion. I have to mention that when I went to WenZhou to study there for 2 weeks, I paid nothing even a penny. 

The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard, it grows and it will be greater than the herbs. All things of this world are counted as nothing but refuse, however, the tree of the Kingdom of Heaven needs the garbage to grow. Our purpose is not the garbage, however our purpose, the tree of the Kingdom of Heaven needs to grow. I don't know WenZhou believers' attitude about money and God, but I know that God doesn't see our outside, but our inside, our heart. Serving God by money, or serving money by God, one hand grasp money, another hand grasp God, are the same things from outside, but only God knows our hearts. There must be enough garbage for the tree of the Heavenly Kingdom, but our purpose is not garbage but the Kingdom of Heaven. All of the world will pass away, but our God lives forever and ever.
