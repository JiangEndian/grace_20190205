灵需要载体，灵如果没有载体，哪里都去不了。一般是风作为载体，以此来发挥作用。或是人的呼吸，或是别的风，这是灵的载体。神以风为使者，就是以灵为使者。因为他们的结合如此紧密，以至于风就是灵。就像现在卖系统的一样，其实是卖U盘。但只要信息与载体结合的足够紧密，就能储存巨量的信息。就算是撒旦，在天上，他也是需要载体的。所谓的在天上，在他们看来，其实是在地上，因此，他们才会想要上到天上去，想要与神同等。因此堕落，被驱逐。Sun 19 Dec 2021 12:26:56 PM KST ，中文和妈妈聊天。
然后想到，风如何能作为灵的载体呢？就像一只能瞬间填充整个内容的U盘一样，比如保存一个人类基因组的数据文件大小是750M，就算不编码明文存储也就3G的长度，一个足够快速的U盘的信息，能够在几秒内成为人类基因组信息的载体。风的流动，或者，分子的无序运动，是无序的，但灵以风为载体，瞬间就能完成填充，风就成为灵的载体，无序的运动，变成有目的的生命。住了吧，静了吧，向我们展示了这种生命，一种以风为载体的灵的生命。然而，我们怎么能判断出，储存了文件的U盘信息不是乱七八糟的胡乱填充呢？我们又如何分辨风中的每个分子的运动不是无目的的呢？如果一只蚂蚁有个触角像是磁盘的磁头一样，能够探索到硬盘上的每一个小部分的磁极方向，那么，蚂蚁能通过什么方法来确定这些磁极的方向不是随机的呢？这就是我们的困境，我们没有上一层的视角。就连我们的DNA，我们都认为是随机的。其实所有看似随机的有序信息，都是被精心设计的。
正是因为灵以风为载体，所以，他以风为使者，施行审判，都使用风，或是瘟疫，或是地震，洪水，都与风有关。我们的灵，也是以风为载体。就是我们的呼吸。身体需要氧气才能活着，但本质上是，我们要让身体需要呼吸，这样我们的灵才能入住。死人的身体，就算魔鬼来了也没有办法。他没有足够的力量来把呼吸灌入死人体内。复活的耶稣需要呼吸吗？他的身体呼吸，是因为需要氧气吗？他完全可以消失不见。对的，他有足够的能量。他能创造，他能消灭。他消灭再造，我们就得以转移。但太空中没有风啊？他以光为载体？
灵能够以光为载体吗？宇宙中没有光啊？灵需要载体。太阳风，算是风吗？任何的流动，都能被灵以他的力量调整每一个微粒，按着灵的心意来。金星成为下着硫磺雨的无水之地，主要原因是因为太阳的风，或者说，灵以太阳的风为载体，驾驭着太阳的风，把金星变成了一个下着硫磺雨的无水之地。但所说，这首先，是因为一场碰撞，一场行星的碰撞，也可以说是一场天上的战争。
我们的身体构造，是因为需要氧气，所以才呼吸，还是因为，要产生出一种呼吸的效果，所以才设计的需要氧气呢？我们要入住一个房间，这个房间需要有门。那么，是因为有门，我们才能进去，还是因为，我们要进去，所以设计的门呢？如果没有门我们当然进不去。也正是因此，设计的门。人体也是一样，如果没有呼吸，机器人不就不需要吗，但，灵要以风为载体进入我们的身体，虽然房间自己不需要门，但入住者需要门，因此，设计了一个门。鼻孔的气息正是如此。身体的存在当然可以设计成不需要气息的，从别的地方也可以获得能量。但为了灵的需要，设计了气息。
灵以风为载体，到底是在哪个层次上？物质能量可以互换，灵与物质能互换吗？灵与能量是能互换的，甚至是等价的。信息与能量的互换，比如电磁波，他肯定是能量，因为微波炉能加热食物。但他又肯定是信息，因为我们的通信就靠着他。信息以能量为载体。能量与物质又可以互换，甚至，根据超弦理论，物质本身，就是另一种信息的能量。灵以风为载体，这个层次，恐怕不止是分子原子，甚至不止是夸克，而是，驾驶着更底层的，弦。用英文的话叫 string，在中文的翻译中，这个词也有种翻译叫做“字符串”，就是一串字符，一串话。他的含义近似于 word. 从这个角度，谁都是靠着他活着，所有的信息都是依附着他的话来活着。甚至是恶灵，甚至是他的敌人。是的，就是这样。恶灵也依附于他的话才能活着，他有着驱逐的权力。
神的本质，就是“存在”。英文的话叫做“to be”，这正是他的名字的意思，יהוה，是。他是，他的本质，就是是，就是“存在”。他是不可见的，因此，我们能接触到的，皆是使者们。但还好，他给了我们耶稣，作为我们可见的神。耶稣，神的话语，神的道，存在的本质。我们总以为，存在的本质是没有意识的，是没有想法的，是没有感情的，这就像是，一个字节的信息是没有意义的一样，太小的太少的信息量，就只有很小的很少的意义。更多字节的组合，才有更多的意义。然而，我们忘了，神的本质是存在，他是所有存在的组合，他充满意义。他是所有存在的意义。我们所有的存在，意义，都在他那里。我们只是部分的存在，他才是所有的存在，从这个角度看，我们才是太小的太少的，没有想法没有意识的，而存在的本质，神，他是所有的存在的本质，他才是有想法有意识的。
保罗所讲的，日期满足，都在基督里面同归于一。灵的战争，就是对弦的频率的争夺，要和自己一个频率。但这得看能量。天上的战争，耶和华神并未出面。代表他的，是米迦勒。因为这不是关于他的战争，是米迦勒和大龙的战争。但，如果把神看为弦，就是泛神论了，就是，所有的东西都是神。还是得看为宇宙之外的。物质之外的，就像信息，当然是物质之外的，但，脱离了物质如何谈信息呢？信息是需要物质作为载体的。软件和硬件当然是两个存在，但，硬件需要软件才能活，软件也需要硬件才能活起来。软件是硬件的生命，是硬件的活动的气息，而硬件，是软件的载体。哪个更重要？有经验的都知道，软件更珍贵。U盘的重要性，难道在于几十块钱的U盘本身吗？在于他里面的无价的信息。看不见的，是更珍贵的。
但，软件如果不能脱离硬件，又如何与硬件成为两个存在呢？答案是因为人的存在。软件不能脱离硬件，信息不能脱离载体，但又是两个存在，这是因为，信息是从载体之外，到载体之上来的。比如一篇文章，无论是纸张还是U盘，他始终都是需要外在的物质作为他这信息的载体的，但，他是载体之外的，对载体来说，是外来的信息。这就是我们的来源。我们的本质是灵，是信息，是物质之外来的。但能进入物质之中，让物质活起来。
这个“物质之外”是哪里呢？是宇宙之外。神造人之初，往物质，一个泥土造的身体里面，吹了一口气，就成了一个有灵的活人。让他活的，就是这个物质之外的一口气，里面所包含的信息。气的本身也是物质，就像笔是一种物质，和纸张一样，但通过这个物质，所传递的信息，是纸张之外的，甚至，是笔之外的。物质只是工具而已。灵以风为载体，就像我们的思想以笔为载体一样，真正的信息，是外来的。但我们的思想也要依附于大脑，这些东西也肯定外来的，这一切被写入的信息，都是外来的。在物质之间转来转去，但哪个物质都不是来源。来源是设计者，写下这些信息的人。就是，作者，author。作者权，authority，就是权力。一切的本源，是独一的神。罗马书 11-36 因为万有都是本于他，倚靠他，归于他。愿荣耀归给他，直到永远。阿们！
万有都本于他，依靠他，又归于他。出于他，通过他，又要归于他，这多么像大爆炸理论啊。这也是这一届的教皇方济各所支持的理论。如果保罗现在还活着，他可能会写下，万有都是大爆炸的奇点给出的，也都靠着奇点所创造的物理定律活着，又都要回归到奇点。然而，这是不是属于自然神论了呢？
如果上帝是大爆炸的奇点，首先可以肯定的是，他是超越物理定律超越时间的存在，甚至，物理定律和时间都是他所创造的。奇点，描述他的词中，都是无限，无限，无限，无限。谁能测度他呢。并且要再归回奇点。是那些物理学家参考了保罗的话呢，还是完全没有参考而产生的概念呢？但保罗明显比那些物理学家要早的多。（但这样的一个奇点，会有想法，有思想，这是我们无法接受的。就像，我们无法接受某个人竟然有思想一样。这是一种歧视，一种轻视。好像只有我们才可以有思想一样。我就经常觉得，只有我有思想。但又想想，别人可能也这样想吧。。。）
这真是的，不闹他们不给办，逼着别人闹是吧。Sun 19 Dec 2021 07:47:15 PM KST ，刚刚妈妈聊到和人聊的护照的，给发邮件问，是不是不让回国了，人就给办了。。。
这是个被咒诅的世界，追求和平正义的人，只能默默的死去，是世界不配有的人。
网站端口更换失败。Sun 19 Dec 2021 08:24:50 PM KST ，刚刚更换了网站端口，结果在浏览器中怎么也打不开网站了。就搜索了解决方案，照着方案做，但并未起效。然后尝试了下用w3m打开，竟然能打开。问题不在网站上。就又尝试着用手机的 firefox 浏览器打开网站，提示了问题所在：因为端口没有使用80, 所以视为非法端口。
如果要打开非80端口的网站，需要在浏览器端进行设置。这会麻烦到所有人。因此，不进行端口更换了。如果服务器的80端口被封了，不让进行网络服务，（话说，刚刚突然想起来，自己天天用3927端口刷alt，也没见怎样啊，不对。。。然后尝试着换到3927端口，嘿，行了～～～啊。。。主啊，谢谢你～～～）3.发现了并不需要记着新端口，输入地址，就自动转入到3927端口了，这真的很方便。就像没有更换过端口一样。但愿他们没有兴趣看这个端口的数据流。
跟这些人打交道太费事了，该他们干的事儿他们也不干。Sun 19 Dec 2021 08:52:31 PM KST ，晚上发邮件给大使馆的人询问办理护照的事情。可能这就是他们的做事方式吧，不催着他们，他们就不干了。嗯，上级授意的应该是。只要不闹，就说明没需要。
就像父母一样，只要孩子不哭，就没有什么需要。不用理。怎么说呢，老实的孩子就饿死了。但，这正是对他们的惩罚不是吗。老实的孩子对他们失望至极，再也不需要他们了。老实孩子损失了一点食物，而他们，损失了一个孩子。没有别的，惩罚或是奖励，就是让他们更加那样。
不义才能当官。Sun 19 Dec 2021 09:08:31 PM KST ，给使馆工作人员发邮件后，和妈妈说这些人你不催就不给你服务的。然后讲，这有他们的电话，如果你没事就给他们打个电话，他们一定很快给你服务的。这不就是耶稣教的嘛。他们就像是不义的官一样。然后妈妈说，不义才能当官。
是啊，如果是义的，不奉承不后门不贿赂，谁会提拔他当官呢。能提拔这样的人的人，又怎么可能会被提拔当官呢。。。唉。。。被咒诅的世界，不义的才能当官。他们奖励恶行，打击顺从。主啊，愿你奖励顺从，嗯，你也放任恶行，将他们安在滑地。主耶稣啊，求你拯救我们。






关于未来的预测：
1.科技的崩溃。主要带领军队降临，以超自然的能力与科技争战，得胜。（契机是人触犯到他。天是他的宝座，人要上天。又要上到月亮，触犯到他，于是，开始争战。）
2.科技的封印。主要将所有的科技毁灭，封存所有的科技知识，一千年。时间点：2031之前（人的所有力量，都是使熵增加的力量，破坏的力量。神的能力，是使熵减少的能力，创造的能力。）
3.宗教为王。那些宗教虔诚的人，无论死活，都要同活，神召来同作王。时间线：2031-2131
4.最后反扑。千年之久，封印解除，人权至上，恢复力量，革命对抗。歌革玛各。时间点：2131
5.仇敌的失败。上来围攻圣城（在哪儿呢？太空？地上？），降火烧火。灭掉肉体工具，审判人的灵魂。时间点：2132
问题：这里的圣城是太空还是地上，是新耶路撒冷吗？还是旧的？旧的？？？
6.战犯审判。旧天地废去（离开空间），在没有空间的地方审判与他争战的灵魂，扔在火湖。
7.新天新地。一个新的预备好的天地（千年时间改造的金星？），新耶路撒冷从天而降（为啥不直接放在上面，因为是外来的，就像月亮一样，从外运来的），神人同居。祭司住耶路撒冷（神的帷幕），诸国的信徒们住在其他地方。羔羊的婚姻，有新妇，有宾客，大家一同欢乐。（但，仍然是，会有背叛他的，就如同早已在天国里生活的天使们之中的一样。）
月朔（新月，就是转一圈而已。每新月来向他下拜。每安息日。这两个时期，是重要的。月亮，很有意义。这是为的什么呢？安息日和其他节期都有意义，月朔的意义是什么？一个新月，月亮从旧到新的。预表一个新的月亮升起。）
但他后来不喜欢，因为，他们的节日都过虚了，没有意义了，就像外邦偶像的节日一样，都成了虚假的仪式了。但耶和华的是有意义的。安息日的意义，是他的安息。各样节奏，如逾越节，意义是纪念他的拯救，使我们自由。但耶稣来了，月朔的节日成就了，是什么？是新的居所，圣城新耶路撒冷。
安息日是因为神在这天安息了。但月朔，一个月亮新出现，这天耶和华做了什么？答案是预备了一个新耶路撒冷。但这成就呢？安息日的成就，是耶稣的安息。月朔的成就，是耶稣的升天首先身体进入新耶路撒冷。然后，他也要带我们进入安息，带我们进入新耶路撒冷。我们进不去，他就带过来。
这些都没有给出意思，就是讲要守这一天，要庆祝这一天。庆祝什么？就像逾越节，是庆祝神给我们自由。可是，月朔是什么日子？庆祝什么？庆祝神给我们有根基的城。当然，自由我们没得到，新耶路撒冷我们也没见着。一切，都得靠耶稣来完成。这座城，是早已有计划做的，就像那个后裔，是早已有计划去赐予的，但直到耶稣来了，成就了。
那些生物，他们肯定能在火湖中生存。因为扔到火湖，只是封印。
In Judaism this renewal is seen as a national rebirth when the Messiah returns, which will be shared by the entire world.  (Chabad)
新月开始一个月，第一天。正月15号是逾越节，耶稣死在14号，那天逾越节是安息日，可以做个日历了：复活在16号，然后是40天的显现，就是第56日，24号，但那天不是安息日，所以，上个月，正月，29天比较合适。不对，这样还是6周之后，42天。不过是把日子数调到了27号而已。。。就那样算的话，是42天之久显现。是大概的40天吗？新月呢？
何西阿书倒是说过要止息以色列的节期，安息日和月朔。每月朔要敬拜耶和华，我们并不是拜月教啊。这个点，很有意思。月朔其中，有耶和华的意味，就像安息日。新耶路撒冷，是在那里建筑吗？或许。
Its re-emergence is compared to the kingdom of David.  “Though it may have lost much of its former radiance, it will be restored to its glory in messianic times,” the Chabad website states.
诗篇 89-35 我一次指着自己的圣洁起誓，我决不向大卫说谎。
诗篇 89-36 他的后裔要存到永远，他的宝座在我面前如日之恒一般，
诗篇 89-37 又如月亮永远坚立，如天上确实的见证。”（细拉）
The Talmud (compendium of rabbinical teachings and discussions) teaches that when the Messiah returns, the moon will cease to diminish and remain as large and bright as the sun.

It has often been said that “truth is stranger than fiction,” and this has never been truer than as it relates to this weighty subject of the man-made creation of “Jesus Christ.” It appears that in A.D. 325, a new god was conceived within the black and white marble halls of Roman Catholicism. As you will soon discover, the name “Jesus Christ” was apparently amalgamated from a long list of pagan god hopefuls. While this name has been revered as set apart above all others for nearly 1,700 years by the naive, serving to unite the universal Roman Empire, yet, its checkered past reveals its illegitimate beginnings. Who would have guessed that our Savior’s name, THE NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES has been overwritten throughout the entire Brit Hadasha (NT) Scriptural text, as a Roman fabricated counterfeit? Might this holocaust of truth be instigated from the pit of hell to thwart YAHUAH’S obedient followers from their quest to worship Him their true ETERNAL FATHER AND SON? For Scripture declares a profound truth:

Neither is their salvation in any other: for there is no other NAME under the shamayim (heavens), given among men, by which we must be saved. P’yilut Hashaliachim (Acts) 4:12

If the true name of our Redeemer, Lamb, Kohen (Priest), and King, is not “Jesus Christ,” then what is His name so it may be fully restored, and that we may worship Him in the Ruach (Yahuah’s Presence) and in truth?

Who is Jesus Christ?

Shockingly, the Ten Commandments and the Creator’s Calendar, with all its set-apart worship days were not the only things altered by mankind in Scripture. Ancient Hebrew kohenim (priests) and scribes removed and replaced the true name of the Almighty Father, YAHUAH יהוה with terms attributed to Baal, such as “Adonis,” “the Lord,” and “God,” over 7,000 times. They claim this was done because the set-apart name was far too revered for mankind to utter. And they further attest, if mankind never actually says the name “YAHUAH,” then they will never break the third command, by taking His name in vain.

This is a poor excuse to never call upon the true name of the Eternal Father, especially when He asks us to, and even requires this of His righteous and obedient followers. This is no different than the man who says don’t share the Good News with me because after you do I will be under pressure and accountable to become a believer. For at least 2,000 years the Israelites have chosen to disobey the Torah by not calling upon the name of our Father YAHUAH. By default, by not taking His name and calling on His name, they have willingly disassociated from Him, the one true Elohim.

This name cover-up was then enlarged upon years later in A.D. 325 when Constantine put his hands in the cookie jar and removed the most delectable morsel of all from the Brit Hadasha (NT) and replaced it with something of his very own creation. But why would he do this? How can this be? What is the evidence this has occurred?

“Jesus” is supposed to be the Anglicized equivalent of the Greek “Iesous,” but really, if it is, it is troubling, to say the least. The English name “Jesus” stems etymologically from “Jupiter-Zeus” the chief god of the ancient Greek Olympus – the coded occult appellation evolving from “J-Zeus”. . . “J-sus”. . . “Je-sus,” to “Jesus”. . . Some authorities, who have spent their entire lives studying the origins of names, believe that “Jesus” actually means— “Hail Zeus!” For Iesous in Greek is “Hail Zeus.” That is, “Ie” translates as “Hail” and “sous” or “sus” is Zeus. Dictionary of Christian Lore and Legend, J.C.J. Melford, 1983, p. 126.

Constantine’s intention at Nicea was to create an entirely new god for his empire who would unite all religious factions under one deity. Presbyters were asked to debate and decide who their god would be. Delegates argued among themselves, expressing personal motives for the inclusion of particular writings that promoted the finer traits of their own special deity. Throughout the meeting, howling factions were immersed in heated debates, and the names of 53 gods were tabled for discussion. “As of yet, no god had been selected by the council, and so they balloted in order to determine that matter. . . For one year and five months, the balloting lasted. . .” God’s Book of Eskra, Prof. S.L. MacGuire’s translation, Salisbury, 1922, chapter xlviii, paragraphs 36, 41. [Roman Catholic mix of legend and history]

At the end of that time, Constantine returned to the gathering to discover that the presbyters had not agreed on a new deity, but had balloted down to a shortlist of five prospects: Caesar, Crishna [Krishna], Mithra, Horus, and Zeus [Roman Jupiter]. Historia Ecclesiastica, Eusebius, c. 325.

Constantine was the ruling spirit at Nicaea and he ultimately decided upon a new god for them. To involve British factions, he ruled that the name of the Druid god, “Hesus,” be joined with the Eastern Savior-god, Krishna (Krishna is Sanskrit for Christ), and thus “Hesus Krishna” [Jesus Christ] would be the official name of the New Roman god. A vote was taken and it was with a majority show of hands (161 votes to 157) that both [man-made] divinities become one god. Following long-standing heathen custom, Constantine used the official gathering and the Roman apotheosis decree to legally deify two deities as one and did so by democratic consent. A new god was proclaimed and “officially” ratified by Constantine. Acta Concilii Nicaeni, 1618.

In light of the historical record above, it becomes difficult at best to deny that “Jesus Christ” is a fictional name, proactively fashioned to replace the true name of the Messiah. Apparently, this new fabricated name was applied throughout the pages of the Scripture’s Brit Hadasha (NT), radically altering every reference of YAHUSHA יהושׁע (H#3091) the Messiah to “Hail Zeus-Krishna” (Jesus Christ). Deceptively, the reference to Christ was never a Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Messiah, but rather, it specifically comes from the name of a pagan god, Christna, most commonly spelled Krishna.

If your heart is sinking about now because you can’t imagine such a thing could be true, then take this to the Eternal Father in prayer. He will give you assurance as He guides you to a deeper knowledge of the truth. This is so important to Him that He and His Son’s name be restored, as it defines who His obedient followers are who are seeking Him with all their hearts in preparation for His Second Coming.

The Birth of Christianity

Shockingly, the birth of what is known today as CHRISTIANITY did not exist until Constantine united his empire under the name of his newly fabricated god “Jesus Christ.” Thus, Constantine presented the man-made god, Jesus Christ, to be worshiped the world over, and it was this fictitious name that was clandestinely applied to the very pages of Scripture replacing truth for error. Who said the Scriptures remain pure and undefiled? Should we not be wise to discern what else has been changed, manipulated, or removed? The discovery of this grand deception should cause all to study deeper into the mines of truth as for buried treasure that we may find lustrous gold— pure, precious, and undefiled.

Simply, no one was a “Christian” prior to A.D. 325. All the churches that claim to be Christian today are merely daughters of the universal Roman Catholic stylized system of false worship of “Hail Zeus-Christna,” with their own sanctified spin and variation on doctrinal beliefs. Prior to that year all of the Messiah’s obedient early believers referred to themselves as the Natsarim (Nazarenes), or were called the Quartodecimen (Fourteeners), my personal favorite, who kept Passover by counting to the 14th day from the full New Month, as their very name reveals.

This quote below clears up many of the differences between three separate religious groups from A.D. 31 to A.D. 325. These are the Jews, the Natsarim (followers of the Messiah), and the Christians, who follow Constantine’s, Jesus Christ. Although, this translation of the Greek original utilized the incorrect name “Jesus,” it was in correlation with the correct term “Messiah,” instead of “Christ.” While a step in the right direction, the use of the name “Jesus” is still not correct according to what is revealed within the quote itself. This is because “Jesus Christ” is the inseparable name manufactured in Rome, while Yahusha the Messiah, who came in the name of His Father and was the original name of the personage who laid down His life upon the cross/stake for the sins of mankind. Thus, His followers never conceived of calling themselves “Christians.”

“But these sectarians… did not call themselves Christians – but “Nazarenes” [Natsarim] . . . However they are simply complete Jews. They use not only the New Testament but the Old Testament as well, as the Jews do… They have no different ideas but confess everything exactly as the Law proclaims it and in the Jewish fashion – except for their belief in Messiah, if you please! For they acknowledge both the resurrection of the dead and the divine creation of all things and declare that God [Alahim] is one and that His son is Jesus [Yahusha] the Messiah. They are trained to a nicety in Hebrew. For among them the entire Law (Torah), the Prophets (Nevi-im), and the… Writings (Ketuvim)… are read in Hebrew, as they surely are by the Jews. They are different from the Jews, and different from Christians, only in the following. They disagree with Jews because they have come to faith in Messiah; but since they are still fettered by the Law – circumcision, the Sabbath, and the rest – they are not in accord with Christians . . . they are nothing but Jews… They have the Gospel according to Matthew in its entirety in Hebrew. For it is clear that they still preserve this, in the Hebrew alphabet, as it was originally written.” Epiphanius; Panarion 29:9:4, A.D. 374.

All Christianized (Hail Zeus-Christna) churches have accepted the names of pagan entities to receive their worship. Add to this that the rhythm of their worship is according to the rhythm of the pagan planetary gods, marking the days of their calendar’s continuous weekly cycle. Their pagan holidays have replaced all the Scriptures prophetic set-apart Feast Days and Sabbaths that identify YAHUSHA יהושׁע as the true Messiah of the promise.

Among these religious organizations, there seems to be an utter lack of interest in reform or a deep desire to learn the truth that they may harmonize their worship rhythms with that of their Creator, and honor His true names. This is not entirely unlike the Catholic Church in the days of Martin Luther. One by one, and for their own particular reasons, each Christianized church since then, clings with the tenacity to their beloved, yet, a fabricated system of beliefs that are often more in harmony with Catholicism than with Scripture and the Most High Eternal Father and Son, whom they claim to worship.

These discrepancies go unrecognized and unresolved as they are what fallen mankind deems as familiar traditions, and what is repeated over and over from week to week from the pulpits where tithes and offerings are received in return for more propaganda. Time, repetition, and the club mentality keep good folks locked into the peer pressure of whatever is popularly taught within their own organization, providing a sense of belonging, but false security, nonetheless.

The Christianized churches continue to utilize the fabricated terms to replace YAHUAH יהוה with “the Lord,” and perpetuate the contrived tradition of replacing YAHUSHA יהושׁע, the Messiah, with “Jesus Christ” (Hail Zeus-Christna). As a result, both the rhythm of worship and who is worshipped no longer resemble the worship required by the Creator, as it is defined in the Tanakh (OT). For they have bartered and traded in the markets of men the true for the false, in order to worship and serve a counterfeit god of their own creation. It was the prince of darkness who once claimed that he was deserving to be like the Most High and determined to take for himself the worship belonging only to Elohim, the Creator:

For you have said in your heart, I will ascend into the shamayim, I will exalt my throne above the stars of Elohim; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation [mo’ed, prophetic appointed fixed time], in the sides of the north [path of the sun, moon, and stars]: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. YeshaYAHU (Isaiah) 14:13-14

This is the point at which the heart that loves the truth should overrule the need to cling to long-held traditions that have turned out to be false. If not, the following verse reveals another truth that may be hard to swallow as its implications are eternal.

My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being kohen for me. Because you have forgotten the law of your Elohim, I also will forget your children. HosheYAH (Hosea) 4:6

Another important point to consider is that the set-apart name of the Eternal YAHUAH יהוה (YHUH) and His Son, YAHUSHA יהושׁע, was never spelled with a “J,” or pronounced as Jehovah because there is no “J” or its phonetic equivalent in the Hebrew tongue. Rather, this was an invention as recently as 400 years ago. The 1611 KJV spells the Messiah’s name as Isous, which you can see for yourself online. The Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) would do well to change their names, as the use of these falsified names announces to the world the first of their many false teachings.

Obedient and True Witness

The Brit Chadasha (NT) bears witness to the greatest story ever told of the fulfillment of the ancient prophecies by the promised Messiah who was to come and lay down His life for all mankind, that in turn they may be restored, but only under the cloak of the Messiah’s righteousness that they may stand in the presence of the Father.

For unto us a child was born and unto us, a SON was given, and the government shall be upon His shoulders. YeshaYAHU (Isaiah) 9:6.

We can have total confidence that YAHUSHA יהושׁע, the Messiah was real, for the very reason that He came right on time according to the Passover Feast day on the astro-luni-solar calendar indicator. He alone is the Alpha and Omega (Aleph and Tav ), the first and the last, the beginning and the end. He alone was the word, and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. Indeed, He has come in real-time, a day for a day, to fulfill the first half of the mo’ed Feast time prophecies. We can trust in verity that YAHUSHA, the Messiah is coming again, very soon, to fulfill in like manner the fall Feast Days, each on their set-apart and appointed day.

Our Messiah, YAHUSHA יהושׁע came in the name of His Father YAHUAH יהוה (YHUH), with a single letter “sh” שׁ added to His name. But additionally, the Messiah’s name “YAHUSHA” describes exactly how He saves. For the “sha” spelled שׂה is the Hebrew word for LAMB. Together, with the “s” שׁ the name YAHUAH becomes the word YAHUSHA, which literally means “YAHUAH saves by way of the LAMB.” Thus, it is that the true Messiah bearing the name of His Eternal Father saves mankind as He alone is the promised LAMB sacrificed for the sins of the world. His very name in Hebrew transmits LIGHT, TRUTH, CONFIDENT EXPECTATION, AND ETERNAL LIFE to all who call upon it.

In contrast, the terms “Jesus Christ,” along with “the Lord,” and “God,” carry no meaning in Hebrew nor do they emit any inherent life-giving qualities in any language or in any capacity. They are mere witty inventions of men, utterly dead and powerless unto salvation and life beyond the grave. Yet, in YAHUAH’S great love and compassion, He continues to wink in times of ignorance (P’yilut Hashaliachim Acts 17:30) and has in the past accepted our worship even when it is to the counterfeit deities.

Perhaps you think this is preposterous and not the actual truth for the mere reason you were not taught this in Third Grade. Perhaps this makes you angry to discover you’ve been lied to? You should be. You should be madder than hell! Might you be angry enough to study this out and ask YAHUAH, through the blood of YAHUSHA the Messiah, to forgive your lack of understanding? We have all been deceived and need to be led back into His truth by His Ruach (Yahuah’s Presence).

If your organization or church teaches you to pray to Jesus Christ and the Lord God, and supports Christmas and/or Easter, all the while frowning on our Eternal YAHUAH’S set-apart days, Sabbaths, and set-apart Feast Days of Scripture, then you are in a false religious organization. Each of these is bent on keeping you dumbed down and lacking in the knowledge of the truth unto salvation, and the power bestowed in the true set-apart names, all the while accepting your consistent giving. This reminds me of the verse describing the seven churches who take hold of Yahusha the Messiah, yet wanting to be filled with their own bread (doctrines of their choosing) and be clothed with anything except His robes of righteousness, all the while wanting to be called by His Name.

And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, we will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach. Isaiah 4:1

Now that this story has already played out, we can see that even though these seven churches claimed they wanted to be called by His name to take away their reproach, this too, they changed from Yahusha the Messiah to Jesus the Christ, calling themselves Christians, a name of their own devising.

Why Does it Matter What We Call the Father and Son?

You may be thinking, why does it really matter what I call the Eternal or His Son, as He knows who I seek to worship? Do the Father and Son really care if I continue using the Roman manufactured names?

1. He has asked that we call Him by His name, His true NAME, not by a title or the name of a fictional god, or superhero of antiquity.

2. We are not to take His name vainly or arbitrarily, but with purpose and honor.

“You shall not take the name of YAHUAH your Elohim in vain, for YAHUAH will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.” Shemot (Exodus) 20:7

“But David said to the Philistine, ‘You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the Name of YAHUAH of hosts, the Elohim of the armies of YAHishraEL (Israel), whom you have reproached.’” Aleph ShemuEL (1 Samuel) 17:45

“He that builds His exalted station in the shamayim (heavens), and has founded His firmament above the earth; He that calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the face of the earth: YAHUAH is His Name.” Amos 9:6

“I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name.” Hagilu Natan Elohim (Revelation) 3:8

“YAHUSHA answered them, ‘I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father’s name, they bear witness of Me.’” YAHchanan (John) 10:25

3. In praise, worship, and song we are to love and magnify YAHUAH and YAHUSHA’S names.

“Also the sons of the foreigner who join themselves to YAHUAH, to serve Him, and to love the name of YAHUAH, to be His servants— everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, and holds fast My covenant.” YeshaYAHU (Isaiah) 56:6

“I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.” Tehillim (Psalms) 9:2

“. . . giving thanks always for all things to YAHUAH the Father in the name of our Messiah, YAHUSHA . . . Ephesians 5:20

4. We shall be called by His true name, and not the name “Christians.”

“So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will prosper them.” Numbers 6:27

“I have come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name [Jesus Christ], him ye will receive.” YAHchanan (John) 5:43 (Jesus Christ is the other name spoken of.)

“They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.” Hagilu Natan Elohim (Revelation) 22:4

“And it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the name of YAHUAH shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance, as YAHUAH has said, among the remnant whom YAHUAH calls. YAH’EL (Joel) 2:32

Referring to YAHUSHA the Messiah, “There is no other name under the shamayim whereby we must be saved.” P’yilut Hashaliachim (Acts) 4:12

6. His Name is eternal and will be magnified and lifted up forever.

“I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.” Tehillim (Psalms) 45:17

“For all people walk each in the name of his god, but we will walk in the name of YAHUAH our Elohim, forever and ever.” MiykaYAHU (Micah) 4:5

“Therefore YAHUAH also has highly exalted Him [YAHUSHA the Messiah] and given Him the name which is above every name. . .” Philippians 2:9

7. The qadosh (set-apart) Name shall be restored.

“For then I shall return unto the peoples a clean language, so that they all call on the Name of YAHUAH, to serve Him with one shoulder.” TsphanYAHU (Zephaniah) 3:9

“And I shall bring the third part into the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined. And I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My Name, and I will hear them: I will say, ‘These are my people.’ And they shall say, ‘YAHUAH is my Elohim.” TsphanYAHU (Zephaniah) 13:9

A paradigm shift is necessary, but in name only, for our Savior, YAHUSHA the Messiah did walk this earth. Together with His Father, YAHUAH and YAHUSHA created all things, and 4,000 years later the creative Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (YAHchanan John1:1). Indeed, He called the twelve and patiently instructed them in righteousness. His arms were outstretched to heal the sick and feed the 5,000 with five loaves and two fishes. He willingly laid down His life sacrificially for all mankind, as a demonstration of His ETERNAL LOVE FOR HIS CHILDREN. His Father’s will He followed in joy and in pain. He took our shame to give HONOR to His Father and restore us in honor back to Him. Defeating death, He rose again in power and exaltation, and His magnificent work on behalf of mankind continues today in His sanctified temple courts above. Soon, He will declare, “IT IS FINISHED,” ending forever His kohen (priestly) work of forgiveness in response to the prayers of His followers, by laying down the smoking censer. He will return again the second time to complete the prophetic mechanism called the plan of salvation, worked out in real-time according to His set-apart timeline of the seven set-apart appointed Feast Days, encompassing this past 2,000 years.

Our salvation is assured as we can discern the truth from error by His Ruach (Yahuah’s Presence) revealing this to us no matter how long we have been entrenched in believing a lie, and no matter whether you are ninety or nine. It is only in finding the truth that the heart that desires it above houses, land, or money, will humble themselves and seek YAHUAH’S face for forgiveness. For there is no tradition on the face of this earth, no matter how deeply seated, that is worth losing our salvation over. No one said it would be easy either. For every new truth, we come to accept, by its very design of cause and effect, we must give up a previously held belief, and this can be downright painful at times. Yahusha our Messiah says . . .

I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come into him and dine with him, and he with Me. To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My seat of power, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His seat of power. Hagilu Natan Elohim (Revelation) 3:18

No one who seeks an everlasting home beyond the pearly gates will be left untouched by the controversy over truth and error. All have been naked, yet all must be clothed with YAHUSHA’S RIGHTEOUSNESS. This is the formula from the beginning in Eden when the first lamb (שׂה-sha) was slain. Its white blood-stained woolen skins were placed by the Creator upon our first parents as the promise of the eternal robes of righteousness that will one day be rewarded to the forgiven and restored obedient followers (Genesis 3:21). All have sinned, but YAHUSHA our Messiah (lamb), has made provision for each person who humbly asks. The choice is yours. We are entering into the refining time as each of us releases our grip on all the things of this world that are not pure gold, tried, and proven to be of eternal weight.

YAHUAH prosper you and guard you; YAHUAH makes His face shine upon you, and show favor to you; YAHUAH lifts up His face upon you and give you assurance. Thus they shall put My Name on the children of Israel, And I Myself shall honor them.
B’midvar (Numbers) 6:24-27

Each of us has the choice to be grafted in and receive His Name on our foreheads. Pray that this name will be YAHUSHA יהושׁע! For the plan of salvation is only baked into the correct name YAHUSHA. Literally declaring to the whole world that the ETERNAL YAHUAH SAVED YOU AND ME BY WAY OF HIS LAMB (שׂה-sha), insuring His promises are trustworthy.
