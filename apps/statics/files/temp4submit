喝淡水真好。过会就满足。但如果喝海水的话，就越喝越渴。越渴越好。无限的渴，无尽的欲望，永远不得满足。无底之坑。Wed 08 Dec 2021 11:18:08 PM KST ，晚上喝水，那一瞬间，真幸福。渴，而喝水的瞬间，感觉真好。但最好是淡水，否则，怎么喝都是渴。完蛋了得。。。

千万不要花费太大精力。免得你甚至觉得我亏欠你。Wed 08 Dec 2021 11:31:32 PM KST ，晚上整理衣服，想到我是直接丢到袋子里。如果有人为我精心的折叠，那真是，最好不要这样。我不想让你觉得你太付出了，不然，你甚至会觉得我亏欠你。因为，有些牧师，觉得自己太辛苦了曾经，就觉得自己配得这样的享受那样的美女之类的。唉。。。不要太辛苦。你千万不要太辛苦。一切，一个词，甘愿。我乐意的。就算因此什么也不得，我乐意的。就当白扔了，我乐意的。嗯。只是付出就高兴，我乐意的。这样才行。否则，千万不要太辛苦。

我可娱乐的电脑设备在身旁，就像以前的平板上有浏览器，有好几个，有youtube，又有bilibili一样，这诱惑，我凭白遭受一番，凭啥啊。。。Thu 09 Dec 2021 05:28:35 PM KST ，把红电脑放在床头，好能打游戏，然后，就对我形成了可见的诱惑。还没开始写作业呢，先和诱惑较量一番，简直费劲。
还有，刚刚梦里被霸凌了不是吗，我在游戏中是不是就那种，我强，就点你一下，点你一下，直到灭了你，那种呢。。。嗯，确实是，互相的霸凌中，我得胜了或失败了而已。唉。耶稣，求你救我。
关于icon的概念，那个确实是代表了某个存在，但，那只是一个icon，不是实体。icon更像是一个链接，代表了点他就能进到整个系统里面，但，整个系统是由许多的东西组成的。而设计者，更是系统以外的。因着他的设计，虽然有许多的组件，却能连接起来，形成为“一”。因他是“一”。Thu 09 Dec 2021 06:01:49 PM KST ，神学书上的讲到圣像崇拜的，从道成肉身而来的icon思想。。。
关键点是，肉身的icon是神设计的，通过简单的点击他，信他，可以进到神的国度。但其他的icons是人设计的无用，是一些，只有icons没有背后的东西的（毕竟得先有背后的整个系统的设计）。除非，我们这些icons也是链接到耶稣，那么，确实能点进神的国度。这样，还是只有一个，就是，耶稣。



The year is ending, time is flying by. I'm glad that the day of the Lord is closer than before. One day, He will come suddenly. I'm waiting for Him. Here is the summary about Christology, there are so many theories about Him, but we will see Him on the last day. So existing. 

The character of Christ and the work of Christ usually are divided into research, but recently, those two areas were recognized that they are closely related with each other. 

There are two reasons for the above change about how we talk about the character and the work of Christ: 1.According to the philosopher Emmanuel Kant, a thing-it-self was divided with the thing in the perceptions of humanity. 2.Functional christology and existential christology are closely connected, Who is He, and what has He done, there is a connection between the two questions. 

For example, when we talk about His work, talk about what He has done, such as His salvation, according to this work, He is our savior, but in fact, only God can save, so, Who is He? It's obvious, He is God, the savior God is He. 

There are some models of Christology to talk about the personality and divinity inside the character of Jesus Christ. According to the council of Chalcedon, the dominance principle of Christology can be expressed as below: Jesus Christ is truly God, also is truly man. 

About the above principle, Maurice Wites said: "The source of salvation should be God, and the seat of a savior should be a man. 

The first christology thought that God's presence inside Christ by His substance. According to the doctrine of incarnation, the substance of God inside His human body. Thus, the word "theotokos" was created to describe Mary, the virgin who born Jesus. 

The word "theotokos" means "the one who born God", or "God's mother", this word explains the humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ. This conception is different with Gnostic, for they think materials are evil, thus in their opinion, salvation is only done in the spiritual area. 

The word "theotokos" and the doctrine of incarnation made Irenaeus think about the substance of Jesus Christ inside the bread and wine of Eucharist. Moreover, this conception has a close relationship with the concept of icon, which means the picture of deification. 

The worship of icons was accepted in Catholic church, and in the 7th century, was recommended in public worship and personal life of reverence. This concept was created by incarnation, but was used in a wrong way. In the incarnation, the body of Christ was made by God as His will, however, in the icons, the icon was made by humans as their will. 

Although icon worship was accepted in Catholicism, there are still many others who rejected such worship, they were called "iconoclast", meaning "those who destroy icons". However, this worship is still in some Greece and Russian churches until today. 

The second christology thought Christ is the mediator between God and man. There are many verses to describe Christ as mediator in the New Testament, thus, the presence of God inside Christ is to be a mediator of fallen humans. To be such a mediator, Jesus Christ must be God and also a man. 

The third christology thought the presence of God inside Christ was divine revelation. Thus, all theology must start from Christ, the divine revelation of God. 

According to above christology, the resurrection of Christ should be explained in the view of revelation, that means, the resurrection of Christ indicates the resurrection of the last day. 

The fourth christology thought the presence of God inside Christ is symbolic. In this christology, Jesus was seen as a man like any other, and anybody could get such the presence of God without Jesus. In this opinion, Christ, or Messiah is a symbol to express the one who let things become New Being. 

The fifth christology thought Christ is the bearer of the Holy Spirit. This is an important concept, rooted in the Old Testament. The word "Messiah" means the one who receives oil, oil means the spirit of God. When Jesus was working in the world, he was seen as a man with the spirit of God. 

The sixth christology thought Christ is the model of sacred life. This was proposed by enlightenment, that Jesus has no difference with us, and the special thing of Christ is his holy life, as a model who has the same will with God. 

There are so many christologies, and all of them have their proof, this is like a blind touch of an elephant, sometimes he gets some information about the legs, sometimes he gets some information about the head. He is the One way to God, but besides God, no one knows Him completely. Praise the Lord for His wisdom, Amen. 











但以理异象：
四兽，四王，四国，（捆绑在幼发拉底大河的四个使者？）
    1像狮子有鹰翅，翅膀被拔，站立如人，得人心
    2像熊，口中三肋骨，吩咐吃肉
    3像豹，有鸟的四翅膀，四头，得权柄
    4十角兽，强壮，力量，大铁牙，吃完践踏，又长个小角，三角被拔，有像人的眼，有口说大话
        小角战圣民，一载，二载，半载，改变节期律法，直到审判者/伸冤者来到，
        十角十王，小角另一王，

宝座，
    案卷展开，兽小角因大话被杀，火中焚烧，其他的兽权柄被夺，生命存留，直到时候日期（灵之权？）
人子，
    驾云而来，在宝座者前，得权柄荣耀国度，各各各各都侍奉他

双角公绵羊，玛代波斯王，
    两角都高后长的更高，往西/北/南，无兽可挡

非常角的公山羊，遍行全地脚不沾尘，希腊王，
    践踏两角羊，正强盛的时候，大角断（BC323亚历山大病死），长四角四国（四将分国），
    一角长出小角一王，向南/东/荣美之地强大，（托勒密王朝）
    高及天象抛落星宿，除掉燔祭，毁坏圣所，因反抗而得着主的军队/百姓和燔祭，顺利的任意而行
    到2300个晚上和早晨，圣所就必洁净。（2300年吗？看看希腊的安条克四世的年代：BC169年洗劫耶路撒冷。。。这样看，-169+2300, = 2131, 这早着呢。。。以色列的第6000年呢？2021是5782, 那么6000年对应的是2021+(6000-5782)=2239，也是差了100年多呢，怎么都不对。。。不过两个历法不同，这样算不合适。。。但现在的是阴阳合历，一致的周期。以前则是阴历，巴比伦历后才有按太阳算年的阴阳合历。）
    （如果从323年分国开始算，则是-323+2300=1977...还有，安条克不是四世吗？怎么还有说五世的呢。。。哦，安条兄是塞硫古王朝的。。。算了吧。。。唉。。。）

加百列陈述，
    70个7为了以色列民和圣城，要除罪引义，封异象预言，并膏至圣者/至圣所，
    490年的沉默，从BC425年，或BC430年的玛拉基先知，到AD29年耶稣受膏，共460年左右（但耶稣年龄，说实话，耶稣是约有30岁，并且先知年代不确定，差不多）

    出令重建耶路撒冷，直到受膏者/弥赛亚，必有7个7和62个7，艰难之时耶路撒冷被重建
    尼希米重建耶路撒冷:AA3526/BC444 耶稣的死:AA4000/AD31，共474年，69*7=483，稍微～

    过了62个7后，弥赛亚被剪除无有，一王来毁灭城和圣所，荒凉已定
    一七之内，他必坚定盟约，一七之半，他必停止祭祀和供献，那行毁灭可憎的如飞而来（罗马王）
    马太福音 24-15 “你们看见先知但以理所说的‘那行毁坏可憎的’站在圣地（读这经的人须要会意）。（那时他们已经经历过了弥赛亚的被剪除，以及耶路撒冷和其中圣殿的毁灭，指的就是罗马皇帝，但不能直接说。就像我们今天指着统治我们的某个至高的王，不能明说一样。你们意会下就明白。）

    到几时才应验呢？一载，二载，半载，打破圣民权力的时候，不懂。。。启示录 12-14 于是有大鹰的两个翅膀赐给妇人，叫她能飞到旷野，到自己的地方躲避那蛇，她在那里被养活一载二载半载。
    就是三载半，1260天，外邦人践踏圣城42个月，即1260天，也就是两个见证人传道的天数，三天半观看尸首，
    在691年，阿拉伯哈里发阿卜杜勒-马利克在登霄石，即圣殿山圣殿的原址上建造圆顶清真寺（萨赫拉清真寺）(691+1260=1951，差不多是夺回耶路撒冷的时候？）隐秘的事是属于耶和华的。。。我是个瞎子。。。吃饭看动漫去。。。

    除掉燔祭设立可憎，1290日之后，等到1335日的便为有福，就是，45天后，
    （这里的“日”，是年吗？为什么不用几个7来表示呢。）
