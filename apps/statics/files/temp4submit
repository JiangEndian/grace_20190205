感觉你内涵到了我，没内涵，没素质，愚蠢，不懂怎么为男人付出，不温柔，妄图教育男人怎么做，还不漂亮。
但是转念一想，男人也一样。
我忽然觉得，蠢人和蠢人在一起，本来就是生活最幸福又最烦恼的事，只是各有各的幸福与烦恼而已。

如果还想挽回，请先意识到这件事的严重性。

这是触犯了老实男人的逆鳞。

恋爱经历少的男生特别怕一件事：我只是被需要，不是被爱。

他们担心的是自己纵使全力以赴，也敌不过内心的白月光，

你跟他在一起只是因为到了一定年纪，需要一个各方面适合的人照顾生活，给予疼爱；而那颗少女心，那种爱及牺牲感，全都留给了青春时代那个他。

情景词和学科词非常重要，请务必至少做到眼熟耳熟。

没多少财产的人，总爱死抓着手上的东西不放。这是生活令人如此绝望的其中一个原因——舍伍德·安德森《鸡蛋》
回顾我的人生，我对一个人占有欲最强的时候，正是我一无所有的时候。

而毕业后，当生命扩展到学生之外的角色后，我发现很多事情比谈恋爱能给我更多的反馈。我开始把更多的精力放在自己的工作和兴趣爱好上。我付出得越多，得到的反馈越好。

我突然发现，占有欲（控制欲）是可以转移或替代的。当从自己的工作中获得充分的掌控感后，我对别人的占有欲减少了。

我不再关心你几点睡觉，不再关心你吃了什么，不再关心你昨天和谁一起出去玩了……我不再关心这些，不代表我不再关心你，而仅仅因为你我都是成年人了，我们都有自己的事情要做。

有意思的是，当过好各自的生活后，我发现我们的关系比以前轻松了很多。

事实上，当你对伴侣占有欲很强的时候，你需要保持警惕。你当然可以自诩深情。但抽象的表达掩盖不了简单的事实：高水平的占有欲必然从一定程度上反映了你对他的高度依赖；有时候，它还或多或少地表明了你的生活状态——你是空虚的。

这一点在那些和前任剪不断理还乱的人身上表现得尤为明显：和前任长达数年的纠缠，大都只是空虚的一种表现。他们一没有能力找到更好的伴侣，二没有可以让自己全身心投入的事业。为了填补空虚，只能打着深情的幌子，和前任保持着密切的往来。

HR能压低你的工资，其实就等于帮公司降低了人力成本。帮公司省钱，也是HR能力的表现之一。以前我们公司HR多次不无得意地跟老板炫技：“那xx高级技工我才加了1k就把他找过来了，要知道以他的水平，大把厂抢着要呢”

老板点头赞许。

大部分员工的收入并不会随着个人的成长，技术的飞跃而增长，只有在跳槽之后才能体现。有些人由于口才不佳，谈薪能力弱，基本上注定了被老奸巨猾的HR碾压式忽悠的命运。没办法，个人的能力短板被人抓住，收入就和能力难以匹配。这个现象恰好印证了第一个案例里HR说的话。


正如前面某位知友说的“只要你提了加薪，在老板心里，你对公司的忠诚度便打了折扣”。特别是一些至关重要的岗位，公司不得不因此做好两手准备。

方案是挺好，但向老板汇报的时候，老板表示公司不接受任何职工的威胁，必须得做两手准备。

威胁？我一脸懵逼

但老板这话几乎是下了定论。于是我不再多言。

从总部回来后和年轻组长沟通，才得知他提薪的时候谈及如果他离职的话，公司生产会立即受影响。

谈薪沟通过程中出现了偏差，导致老板理解为他威胁公司正常生产经营。

不久后因为其他的事，年轻组长不得不离开公司。几个月后给我电话，下家直接给他加了2k。我说工资终于配得上你了。

这个事的结果就是我们公司拒绝了500块的加薪，花了更多的钱找了一个技术、身体状况都远不如原职工的老师傅，更郁闷的是生产效率还有了明显的降低。

这损失不可谓不大。

时隔多年，我依然反复咀嚼当时的情形，除了倍感困惑之外，更多的还是唏嘘：

这事件之中，每个人的选择的合情合理，年轻组长认为自己配得上更高的工资，HR为公司建构了更加稳固的人才梯队，老板敏锐地嗅到了公司人才队伍的脆弱现状，然后他们做出了理智的选择。

说明这个老板就是要那种任劳任怨的员工

那为什么那个年轻人能跳操加薪成功呢，说明老板和老板之间还是有差别的

心态不一样啊，前面的老东家也肯出这么多钱再请一个啊

效应就是主疑臣死。
没有多少的离职心态，一步到位。

等到员工自己提出要调薪了，说明他心里已经有50%的离职准备了。等到员工自己提出离职再想用调薪留人，基本是不可能留得下的，因为对方在外面拿到的报价现在公司是不可能给予的。

也许HR能做到，但老板不同意，比如这个领导明明白白的表明了这个员工的价值，但老板愣是不想给这500

这个是真的。。我同事的前同事就有被这样对待过，600块，老板娘不肯加，跳槽出去翻倍。

我反而觉得，公司高层考虑稳定性是可取的，因为一旦破例调薪，可能引发无法预见的情况，而另请员工都是可预见的。公司的效率可能提高了，但却造成了潜在隐患。故这个员工骑驴找马是最好的，找得到好的皆大欢喜，找不到他也可以安心工作。

主要是怕开了头，将来谁提加薪都不能怠慢，加薪这种事的长期影响还是很复杂的，只能说是博弈困境

貌似是公司算不清这年轻技术员为公司节省的价值，500的加薪还不足他节省一个工时的价值

이번주 내가 성천교회 갈 까요? 엄마의 생일을 같이 지내고 싶어요.

안녕... 아까 교실 사진 찍고 보내고 싶은데 엄마가 메시지를 보는 것을 봤어요.

내가 왜 할 일 없는 사람과 같아서 매일 엄마 보고 싶기만 해요? 엄마가 이런 아들이 좋지 않겠죠?

그래요. 우리 엄마 목사님을 섬기는데 아들도 돌봐줘서 감사해요. 아들도 자기의 일에 전념해야 돼요. 사랑은 줄은 너무 빡빡하면 서로 죽일 수 밖에 없는 것 같아요.

내 아들.오늘수업끝나면 성천교회로 와라.

근데 오는 돈이 있냐?

그래요. 가겠습니다.

갈 돈이 좀 있을 것 같아요.

晚上不要喝水，起夜不要起来，影响自己睡眠，也影响他人睡眠。

今天满足了，喝到奶了。2021年03月27日21:12:18，昨天见到妈妈，抱抱亲亲，半夜也打扰她，导致她没睡好，我心里非常抱歉。上午去买东西，想着我不能这样不满足的折磨人，得喝到奶才行。就去买了两个带吸管的。然后晚上，快到9点了，想着她今天得早点睡，就亲亲抱抱要喝奶，然后喝到奶了，一瓶喝完，饿了，再舔掉残留在奶嘴上的，然后盖上，好好保存起来。然后再亲昵一会，送妈妈上去休息。让她把楼梯门反锁，不过楼梯门好像关不上尴尬了。还好还好，我今天喝足奶了。嗯。妈妈说我是巨婴。是的，我是巨婴。，。唉呀，不想闹人了，喝到了喝饱了满足了。不然还是不满闹人不好。。。真好，喝足了奶，可以不闹腾，而是，安息了。在父亲的王国里。

美国主导的体系下，他们都是受益者，自然不会允许另一个挑战者的成功。

而「大国崛起」「民族复兴」，对他们就是毁灭，失去现有的经济/政治地位。


从产业升级被明确作为目标开始，中国就必然与大多数国家彻底走向决裂。

对发达国家而言，中国爬上高价值产业链会将他们挤下去，必然会拼死阻击。

对落后国家来说，中国一旦成功了就不会再有产业转移，自己永无出头之日。

曾经的万灵药「中国庞大的市场」，以后在外交层面的吸引力只会越来越小，他们为了保住自己的产业地位和前景，已经将放弃中国市场作为一种选项来考虑了。


只要发难了一次都能统计进来？至少统计口径设置成发难超过支持的次数吧。我们又不是温室里的花朵需要惯着，亲兄弟还明算账呢，有点磕磕碰碰是很正常的，得多摸爬滚打适应。

西方文明不是唯一的，中东穆斯林还在，外交也是逐渐开展的。以前敌众我寡是事实，但是秦灭六国也是合纵连横。各方利益不同，敌人也不是铁板一块。今天的敌人有可能是明天的盟友。

有些评论真是单纯，国际关系很复杂，又不是非敌即友，反对的不一样是敌人，也可能是表态而已。赞同的不一定是朋友，也可能是钱给太多了。前年70周年国庆，有三个熟悉的国家都发射了导弹呢，按照非敌即友的观点，可都是敌人啊

圣灵必胜过情欲。我们的父亲，我们的王，要在我们心灵的战场，得胜。2021年03月28日07:07:08，刚刚洗澡，一个惊人的改变，没有再性奋，真是纯洁的关系了现在。嗯佃，其实从昨天，喝到奶，满足了，没有别的欲望的时候，就有点感觉了，直到今天，圣灵完全胜过情欲。








주제: 하루 한끼 안식 된다.

우리 엄마, 잘 지내셨어요? 

어제 일요일에 원장목사님의 무리로 성도들이 다 소리없이 행동으로 화를 냈어요. 
오후 2시 반 예배중에, 설교전에 큐즈가 있어요. 하지만 원장목사님이 자기만 말하고 "이런 말을 하려고 하는 성도들이 손들어 줘라"고 했어요. 한 시간 반 동안 그랬어요. 그리고 설교 하기를 시작했어요. 
설교를 위한 기도를 하고, 목사님이 밑을 보고 좀 불안한 것 같아요. 그래서 "한 시간반 큐즈가 했어 시간이 다 된다"고 하고 또 다시 마무리 기도를 하고 축도를 했어요. 축도 마치자 마자 다들 일어나서 밖에 나갔어요. 
목사님이 혼자 강단위에 서서 광고하는 것이 조금 이상해요. 빨리 마치고 밖에 나가서 성도들을 배웅했어요. 

제가 요새 매일 한끼 먹게 되었어요. 배고픈 일이 있지만 제 인생은 배불러하기 위해 온 것이 아니잖아요. 그리고 제가 요새 매일 9시쯤에 자요. 즐길 것이 많지만 안식은 제일 좋아요. 

좋은 것을 다 가지고 싶은 것이 우리 모두의 본성이에요. 우리 하나님은 좋은 것을 창조하고 "심히 좋다"고 하고 안식하셨어요. 
이 시대의 젊은이 들이 거의 안식을 두려워해요. 심야 까지 즐기고 쉬는 것을 원치 않아요. 고통이나 기쁨이나 다 힘든 것이에요. 그 무엇보다 안식은 영원한 생명이에요. 

나와 우리 엄마, 다 주님안에서 안식을 얻을 수 있도록 우리 주님이 은혜내려 주시길 원해요. 


주제: 송구영신.

우리엄마, 잘 지내셨어요? 



오래 동안 엄마한테 편지를 안 보냈어요. 하지만 엄마의 생각이 항상 내 머리 안에 있어요. 엄마를 그리워해요. 



교회에서 있으니까 매일 4시반쯤에 일어나요. 그래서 4시반쯤에 일어날 수 있도록 항상 9시쯤에 자요. 

그리고 교회에서 이런저런 일이 있어서 낮잠을 안자요. 때론 새벽기도한 후 더 자요. 



매일 한끼씩 먹는 것은 진짜로 효과가 있어요. 내 무거운 몸이 가벼워질 수 있어요. 

하지만 그런 것도 쉽지 않아요. 때론 점심때 어떤 사람이 오게 되면 다 같이 먹어야 돼서 하루 두끼나 심지어 세끼 먹게 돼요. 게다가 원장목사님이 그저께 내게 양념 소고기를 사주셔서 엄청난 유혹을 당해야 돼요. 제가 유혹 앞에서 항상 실패해요. 



오늘 점심 같이 먹은 후, 제가 서표를 자르면서 목사님의 전화를 들었어요. 원장목사님이 다른 목사님이랑 통화할 때 이선생님을 대해 많이 비평했어요. 

그리고 제가 듣고 교훈을 받았어요. 그분이 이 선생님을 비평하면서 나를 징계하는 것 같아요. 



오늘 여기 수도관이 얼어붙여서 하루종일 온수가 없어요. 그래서 아까 제가 주방에서 뜨거운 물을 받고 화장실에서 머리를 감았어요. 



조금 이따가 11시에 송구영신 예배가 있어요. 

지난간 일년에 하나님이 우리에게 은혜를 주셔서 감사해요. 그리고 새로운 일년에 하나님이 계속계속 우리를 지켜주시고 보호하시길 원해요.

summary of the book called "DaQinJingJiaoLiuXingBei".

Summary of chapter three: GuangZhou, the opening door of Qing dynasty and the Acts of China. 

GuangZhou and QuanZhou are other     gate for the missionaries of China. Although the seed of gospel has rooted in China from the Tang dynasty,    went by the Yuang, Ming, Qing, but cannot root in China thoroughly. Thus missionaries of Protestantism knocked the door of China in the Ming and Qing dynasty through Macao and GuangZhou, which was     trade gate of China because of the well developed waterway. 

GuangZhou was     a important trading port of     waterway from the Tang dynasty, however in the Yuan dynasty, QuanZhou was the main trading port, and GuangZhou was the supplementary trading port. 

QuanZhou attracted many merchants from abroad and inland, because of the opening policy of the Yuan dynasty, there are many temples of many religions were built here, and in the 20th century, there are many monuments were excavated here. Those monuments were "the cross of QuanZhou". 

There are protestant missionaries     came into China in the period of Opium-war, which was waged by England because of their business affairs. In the 19th century, many silvers of England flowed into China mainland because of the trading between England and China. Thus they want to retrieve their silver and     made opium to sell to Chinese. However the Qing dynasty rejected opium and forbade it     duo to the profound social problem     occurred with opium, so the armies of England waged the Opium-war,    opened the door of the closed Qing dynasty. Because of this, those protestant missionaries have the chance to get into the mainland of China. 

Met by war not      peaceful way, there are many hostilities between western world and China. Although Christianity was preached again in China because of the coming of the missionaries from the western world, there were many suspects and doubts against those missionaries, such as thinking them as spies or dogs of the western world. But those missionaries breathed with lower classes and did the works of education and medicine, they also held the Enlightenment campaign to oppose opium. Different     with the Catholic which preached gospel from the Tang dynasty by the way from upper classes to lower classes, the protestant missionaries preached gospel from the bottom of society to the upper classes. 

The first protestant missionary from western world was Robert Morrison, he came into China mainland and stayed in China mainland for 27 years and       done many works for Chinese, especially the translation work of Chinese Bible and the Chinese-English dictionary. Also he built      church, school and hospital for Chinese. 

Morrison was born in 1782, January, and became a pastor in 1807, then he was sent to preach gospel in       China mainland, his work included Bible translation and dictionary compiling. Although he    was want to get into China by the boat of the East India company, he   can't   got a permission and was rejected for some reasons. Then he decided to go to China by the cargo boat of America. He departed from England to New York, and      take a cargo boat from New York to China. When he was asked about whether he can heal the idolatry of Chinese, he replied that he can't but he believes God can do it. Thus Morrison arrived at GuangZhou in 1807, and when he   was went by Macao, he said, "OH, The biggest nation of the earth, the nation of stone, when will you open your door?" 

After Morrison arrived      at China, he studied Chinese from 2 Chinese Catholic secretively, for it was forbidden to teach foreigners Chinese. Morrison didn't receive any support from Mission Union and solved all problems by himself, he was a tentmaker missionary. Morrison had worked in     East India company for the message of this company which       maybe used in his missions. 

The result of his efforts were the book of Acts of Chinese version in 1810 and the New Testament of Chinese version, and a baptized christian who was called CaoGao. In 1815, Morrison published the Chinese Monthly Magazine with the help of William Milne, who       was came from the Mission Union of London in 1812 to help Morrison. In 1816, Morrison       send away the Chinese Bible to Korea by an English explorer. In the same year, Morrison baptized a Chinese worker who was called LiangFa, in the printing office. Morrison and Milne finished their translation work in 1819, the whole Bible was translated by Chinese. In 1823, Morrison baptized LiangFa's son who was named LiangJinde, and LiangFa became the first Chinese christian missionary. 

Morrison        backed to London in 1824, to present the King of England the Bible of Chinese Version and the map of BeiJing, and he became a member of the Asian Academic Union. Morrison came to China again in 1826, LiangFa worked as an assistant of Morrison,         concentrate on mission and writing. The book of LiangFa called "QuanShiLiangYan" influenced HongXiuquan a lot, who was the leader of the "TaiPing Heavenly Kingdom" movement. Morrison sent         an letter to ask support for        China Mission and thus many missionaries came to China from America,        famous one of them was the pastor Elijah Coleman Bridgman, who devoted his whole life to China. Bridgman studied Chinese from Morrison and taught English to LiangFa's son, LiangJinde. 

Morrison and Bridgman reported their mission and asked support by sending letters to many churches of Europe and America in 1832. Morrison left the world because of sickness on August 1, 1834, in GuangZhou. 

When we talk about the leading missionaries such as Morrison, there is a man we can't omit, Karl Friedrich August Gutzlaff, a German missionary. Gutzlaff was a Lutheran, he decided to do abroad missions in 1818, age 15. In 1826, he graduated from Netherlands missionary school and became a pastor of Lutheran Church, was sent to Java as a missionary in the next year. There were many Chinese         lived in Java too, thus Gutzlaff studied Chinese from those residents, and had a dream of       China Mission. 

Gutzlaff arrived at Siam Bangkok in 1828 with missionary Jacob Tomlin, in where more than half of       it's resident's were Chinese, thus he studied       FuJiang and         GuandDong language to prepare for the China Mission. The first missionary travel of Gutzlaff was in 1831, cost 6 months, by a Junk Ship of his Chinese friend. In 1832 and 1833, he started his second and third missionary         travel from Macao. His fourth missionary travel was in 1833, by the boat called John Bigger to QuanZhou, fifth missionary travel was in the same year by the boat called Colony Young to FuJiang, and backed to Macao on March 24, 1834. He did the work of translation and writing in Macao. 

One notion of Gutzlaff is that "Chinese should bear their own mission", and thus he organized       a inland missionary union called The Chinese Union. There were 22 members in this union, and all of them were Chinese except Gutzlaff. Of course there were some problems in this union, and after the      dead of Gutzlaff        on August 1851, the union       was died too. On his gravestone, "First apostle of modern China" was inscribed. 

Because of the efforts of those missionaries, including those Chinese missionaries such as CaoGao, LiangFa, and LiangJinde, the gospel rooted deeply in China mainland, and there are many famous Chinese       pastor occurred in the history. 

Shong Shangjie was a famous figure called "Paul of China ", born in 1901,       FuJiang province, as a son of       pastor. After he graduated from university with a flying grade, he entered the graduate school and got a master degree and finally got a doctor degree in 1926. However, to study theology, he rejected all lure and entered Union Theological Seminary. 

Shong Shangjie read         Bible 40 times when he was captured in psychiatric hospital because of his unusual behavior, and in that period he had special experience which let him to devote his life to preach the gospel. After he escaped from psychiatric hospital with the help of his friend and Chinese embassy, he         backed to China, and he threw away all his certifications and diplomas into the sea, like Paul, to throw away all honors of this world and just preach the gospel. He preached gospel in China for 15 years and scholars divided his activities as 5 sections. When he was living, he read       Bible and      pray for several hours everyday, and        fall on his knees to wait       the revelation of God       in night. That's the source of his great power. 

Another famous figure was       YangXinfei, a musical missionary, was born in 1928, as a daughter of        pastor, she devoted her whole life to God and never married, that's her promise with God. After the establishment of         People's Republic of China, her life became harder, however she still made         grate improvement in the area of music and became a teaching assistant after she        graduate. To keep the promise with God, she         backed to her hometown XiaMen to live a life as a missionary. Although she      sicked in 2004, which caused her to live with wheel-chair, she still kept her promise with God,         acted as a "wheel-chair missionary". 

One other was LinXiangao, who was born in 1924, Macao, in a christian family, and baptized in 1936 in Hong Kong. The name of LinXiangao means "offering lamb to Christ," and thus his English name was "Samuel Lamb". He started his mission in 1945 and had a         grate influence in China. He died in 2013 because of sickness, age 90. 

Through the missionary history of modern China, we can find that although China still needs foreign missionaries, the missionaries of Chinese are becoming more and more than before. In the first time when Christianity came into China, there        are no other ways but preaching gospel by those foreign missionaries through         translator, however along with the rooted gospel       become stronger, more Chinese missionaries occurred. 

Gospel will thrive in good soil, although the        heart land of Chinese seems hard to root, there are many people who were chosen and were kept by God, to those people,         gospel will be preached easily and root well. A big stone in the soil of China is that the religion of Christianity was coming from western world, who had invaded China in history. Because of this big stone, the most part of        China mainland don't have enough        place to let the gospel thrive, this stone of invader oppressed Chinese in the mainland of China, and nowadays, this stone of invader oppressed gospel in the        heart land of Chinese. Somewhere is roadside, somewhere is rocky ground, somewhere is thorn land, somewhere is good soil. Unfortunately, we can't choose which soil we will be, like nationality when we were born. However fortunately, we can't choose which soil we will be, good soil is not his own cultivator. The grace of God is sufficient for his people. הָלֶלוּיָה.
