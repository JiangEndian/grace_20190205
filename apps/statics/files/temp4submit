卡尔波普也说过：缔造人间天堂的结果无一例外造成人间地狱，它导致不宽容。这句话点明一个天堂的悖论。天堂是不是自由的？如果不是，就不算天堂。如果是，那人就可以用自由做 假丑恶，这就不算天堂。其实人都不一定要做什么，只要有自由去冷漠旁观不鼓掌，这就与天堂违和了。天堂是要人人鼓掌的，但凡有投票，都要全票通过的。综上，天堂在凡人的世界不存在。
天堂要存在则必须改造每个人的思想，每个人都自发主动杜绝假丑恶。这种改造不同于一般的开启明智，其大概等于改造基因。（是的了。基因改造。我们都成为神的儿女。啊。。。新造的人。嗯。。。世人也能看明白了。。。）

Arminianism is based on theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609) and his historic supporters known as the Remonstrants. His teachings held to the five solae of the Reformation, but they were distinct in some ways from particular teachings of Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers. Jacobus Arminius (Jakob Harmenszoon) was a student of Theodore Beza (Calvin's successor) at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a soteriological diversification of Protestant Calvinist Christianity. However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.

Fundamentalism usually has a religious connotation that indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs. However, fundamentalism has come to apply to a tendency among certain groups—mainly, though not exclusively, in religion—that is characterized by a markedly strict literalism as applied to certain specific scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, and a strong sense of the importance of maintaining ingroup and outgroup. distinctions, leading to an emphasis on purity and the desire to return to a previous ideal from which advocates believe members have strayed. Rejection of diversity of opinion as applied to these established "fundamentals" and their accepted interpretation within the group is often the result of this tendency.

He opposed the idea of predestination and asserted a strong version of the doctrine of free will. He was accused by Augustine of Hippo and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing good works. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of original sin. His adherents cited Deuteronomy 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a heretic by the Council of Carthage. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as Pelagianism. St. Augustine opposed this philosophy.

Monergism is the position in Christian theology that God, through the Holy Spirit, works to bring about the salvation of an individual through spiritual regeneration, irrespective of the individual's cooperation. Monergism is most often associated with Calvinism(such as Presbyterianism and the Dutch Reformed Church) and its doctrine of irresistible grace, and particularly with historical doctrinal differences between Calvinism and Arminianism.

In theology, synergism is the position of those who hold that salvation involves some form of cooperation between divine grace and human freedom. It stands opposed to monergism, a doctrine most commonly associated with the Lutheran and Reformed Protestant traditions, whose soteriologies have been strongly influenced by the North African bishop and Latin Church Father Augustine of Hippo (354–430). Synergism is upheld by the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, and by the Methodist and Pentecostal traditions of Protestantism. It is an integral part of Arminian theology.

Prevenient grace is a Christian theological concept rooted in Arminian theology, though it appeared earlier in Catholic theology. It is divine grace that precedes human decision. It exists prior to and without reference to anything humans may have done. As humans are corrupted by the effects of sin, prevenient grace allows persons to engage their God-given free will to choose the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ or to reject that salvific offer.

Chapter 8, Suzhou, the city in earth to be a heavenly city. 

Suzhou is a city in eastern China, in the province of Jiangsu, situated west of Shanghai on the Grand Canal. In ancient time, Suzhou was called Wujun, because it was the capital of the ancient Wu kingdom, and Suzhou is a famous place of China 10 main sightseeing spots. Suzhou is a beautiful city, described as a heavenly city in earth, said, "There is heavenly kingdom above, and there is Suhang below", to contrast this city with heavenly kingdom to express how beautiful is this city. 

Suzhou can be described as a city of water, there are many water ways in this city, more developed than land way. According to history, before protestant has preached gospel here, there was a Catholic missionary Matteo Ricci who came to Suzhou and stayed here for a while. In that period there were 10 people became believers. 

After the First Opium War, some harbor city was opened to outside, but still there were some restrictions of mission, and preaching gospel inland was forbidden. Afterward, the way to enter to inland to preach gospel was opened, but the reaction of inland was hostility. 

When it was Taiping heavenly kingdom movement inside, and western powers outside, Suzhou met Christianity again. In 1850, a protestant missionary started his mission in Suzhou, when it's not allowed to preach gospel openly. The name of above mentioned missionary was Charles Taylor, a missionary sent by South American Methodist Church, with B. Jenkins. The arrived at Shanghai first, and built church and their house to make a base for their mission. They preached gospel in Shanghai and Nanjing, afterward they went to Suzhou to do their mission, and Taylor was called Dai doctor at that time. In 1853, Taylor finished his 5 years life in China and returned to his country, further more, he wrote his experience of his life in Chan. 

The door of mission was opened after 1856, due to the Tianjin Treaty. In Tianjin Treaty, not only the harbor but also the inland was opened to missionaries to let them preach gospel freely. Although only Catholic was mentioned in this treaty, the Deputy Representative of America, who was a missionary, added "Protestant" in this treaty to grant the same right as Catholic, and the place was expressed as "Harbor and other places" in this treaty. Thus, protestant got the right to preach gospel inland. 

After Tianjin Treaty, missionaries have the right to go to Suzhou to preach gospel legally. One important figure was J. W. Lambuth, he entered Suzhou in 1859. According to the diary of Wangtao, before March 1859, the mission was started in Suzhou already. In his diary, he mentioned about Griffith John, a pastor of London mission committee, came to China with his wife in 1855, and preached gospel in China for 51 years, was called "the Father of the mission of Central China" and "the Apostle of Central China". 

Suzhou was captured by Taiping armies in June, 1860, in that time, Tarleton Perry Crawford, James L. Holmes, J.B. Hartwell and other missionaries came to Suzhou to meet the leader of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and was welcomed by LiShusong. After that, more missionaries came to Suzhou to meet HongXiuquan and LiShusong, those missionaries think they are true believers of Christianity, and they wanted to make Jiangsu province to become a christian city. But afterwards, those missionaries found out that the leaders of Taiping were not good partners in mission, and they left each other, became enemies finally. After the fall of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in Suzhou, until 1863, missionaries did go to Suzhou again. 

But there are some merits of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, because their policy, they were supported by the people in Suzhou, and this point made contributions to the mission of preaching gospel. 

Another important missionary work was documentary work. One important figure in this area was a North American Presbyterian Church missionary, George F. Fitch, who came to China in 1870 and preached gospel in Suzhou and Ningbo. He built the "American Presbyterian Mission Press" and published many christian books. Those books were circulated in Suzhou and the readers increased more and more, it helped those poor a lot to understand Christianity. 

After Qing government recovered Suzhou, many people came back from Shanghai and started to rebuild Suzhou. In this period many missionaries work with them in the area of medical and education. An important missionary was James William Lambuth, a believer of South American Methodist Church. Lambuth came to Suzhou and met a man called "A man who make button called Li", the man who make button baptized with children and became believers. Afterward when Lambuth went to Suzhou to preach gospel, he lived in his home. Furthermore, the man who make button became a pastor and was welcomed by many Chinese. 

Another man who walked with Lambuth was CaoZhishi, who was an orphan and was adopted by Lambuth and his wife Mary Isabella McClellan when they met in Shanghai. After been an adoptive son of Lambuth, he was taught Bible and understood thanks and grace, thus he became a christian and the church of Lambuth became his home. 

CaoZhishi went to America with his adoptive parents and lived in America for 10 years. When he returned to China, he arrived at Shanghai and worked with Lambuth together. Lambuth and his wife sent him as a missionary, thus CaoZhishi came to Suzhou in 1870 and use a house of his friend, a christian, as his preaching place. This place became the first base of mission of America Methodist. CaoZhishi did his mission and heal those ills and teach those students who have no chance to study. 

CaoZhishi started as a orphan and became a missionary afterward, furthermore he became an excellent family because he married YanZhenqin's sister. He praise God who made him and gave him so many grace, and the family of YanZhenqin who embrace CaoZhishi with charity even an orphan he was moved us. 

CaoZhishi's mission was helped by A. P. Parker, who was sent by Lambuth to Suzhou in 1876. Parker regards education as important as building church, thus he raised funding in America and bought "TianChizhuang" as built house for missionaries and school, and the name of the school was changed to Buffington Institute to commemorate the most important sponsor Buffington, this institute became the first church school in Suzhon. 

Beside the school, W. R. Lambuth built an hospital and became one part of Buffington hospital afterward. Buffington hospital was built by William Hector Park, who came to Suzhou on December 17, 1882, and for training the workers of hospital he built a school of medicine. There were many patients healed in this hospital and became believers. 

At the end of 19th century, many denominations of Christianity came to Suzhou and built 21 church schools, Soochow University was one of them. Soochow University was built by American Methodist in TianChizhuang in 1900, was the first western university in China. The motto of this school was "Unto a Full Grown Man" and she indeed trained numerous professional experts for China. 

There were many churches built in Suzhou, one is called "ShiDutang", built by Hampden Coit DuBose in 1872. DuBose worked in Suzhou for 38 years and died in Suzhou at his 65 in 1910, after his death his son came to Suzhou and dedicated himself to the mission of gospel. The name of this church was changed many times, as the first church in Suzhou, she was also called "ShouTang", and her name was changed to "Saint John" eventually. She was managed by "LiangHui" now, the two committees of Chinese Christianity. 

The second church of Suzhou was "LeQunSheHuiTang", built in 1892, was called "ErTang". The constructor of this church was Thomas A. Hern, who came to Suzhou at 1890, and built the church of "LeQunTang" in 1891, and built the church of "JiuShiTang" in 1892". The second church of Suzhou was built by American Methodist, the name of this church was called "ShanTang" because she was the third church in Suzhou. Besides these, until 1946, there were 14 churches and 9 spots of church built by 8 denominations of Christianity. After the establishing of PRC, in April 1955, the three-self patriotic movement committee of Suzhou Christianity was established to seek how to survive and growth under the system of socialism. 

Suzhou is a beautiful city in China, her beauty not only expressed by those nature scene, but also expressed by her history of Christianity. As a main place to preach gospel in China, Suzhou has an important role, she received many missionaries and there were many churches and schools built in this place. From the history of Christianity in Suzhou, we can find so many missionaries, their dedication to Suzhou made this place became a real "Heavenly Kingdom of Earth". 

The main aspect of Heavenly Kingdom can't be the beauty of her outside, but the inside of her, the belief in God. Not only Suzhou, but every place in the earth, without the belief of God, no matter how beautiful she is outside, but never can be a place of heavenly kingdom. The core of the kingdom of heaven is God, no one can replace his position, neither those kings, nor those beautiful scenery. The same of our heart land, not those virtues or merits make our heart become the kingdom of God, but the only One God himself in our heart makes our heart become his kingdom, in where he reigns. His reign endures forever and ever.
