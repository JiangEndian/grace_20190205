Mark 11-13 And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. Mark 11-14 And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it. Mark 11-20 As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots.
所以我作为一棵无花果树的话，虽然不开花，但果子要常备着。因为耶稣可能要来找我要。那时没有就尴尬了。。。果子常备着，耶稣要的时候就有。嗯。。。（但我的果子是什么呢？主啊，求你引导我，让我认识我自己，我该生产什么。是敬虔的生活吗？是信徒吗？是祷告吗？是话语的 practice 吗？）
