1. Do you agree or disagree with the following  statement? People often buy products not because they really need them but because others have them.

China's economy is taking off, which brings a lot of benefits to its people including a great increase in their purchasing power. In recent years, people have become keener on buying things than ever before. Thus, a heated debate has arisen among the public about the cause of people's growing passion for shopping. The way I see it,  following suit is most likely to be the very factor that drives people to purchase. I am about to justify my viewpoint by discussing two typical cases.
following suit跟着做, 跟着出同花色的牌 跟进，有样学样

The first case is the zeal for buying electronic products. As we know, the rapid development of science and technology keeps people updating their electronic products all the time. Those equipped with latest versions of high-tech gadgets are labeled as tasteful and fashionable icons. In order to be like that, people, especially the young, tend to follow trendy individuals-to buy just exactly what they have. For example, whenever new iPhone come out in the market, there is a fever of purchasing all over the world. Of course, people do buy iPhones to facilitate communication. but they probably more want to catch up with the times.
trendy时髦的，赶时髦的 facilitate使（行动，过程）更容易；推动，促进；便于 

Finance products are the other good case in point. Under most circumstances, due to the lack of a clear idea about how to buy financial products, people are inclined to follow the footsteps of others, considering that this is an effortless way to do about their wealth. In the stock market, there are a multitude of amateur investors like senior citizens, or some illiterates. They neither spend time studying the trend of the market nor investigate what's going on with the listed companies, and they do nothing but to follow some so-called professional ones to buy stocks.
Finance财政；金融 incline倾向于，持…意见 amateur外行 业余爱好者 illiterate不会读写的，不识字的 

Admittedly, I am not saying that people buy products without any practical purposes. It is impossible for people to buy something useless, and the practicality of what they buy is always their NO.1 concern. However, if we analyze the deep motivation of consumers when they shop, we can find that they are more likely to buy something that others have already had,  because nobody is willing to be Guinea pigs to any new product.
Guinea pig豚鼠，天竺鼠  供实验的人（或物），实验品  

To put in a nutshell, people buy products not because they really need them but because others have had them. Owing to the limitation of room, I am unable to give more cases, but  believe that the above-mentioned electronic products and finance products have already proven the validity of my viewpoint.
Owing to由于；因为 validity确凿性

2. The advantages and disadvantages of a new factory near your community

I live in a primarily agricultural community, and most of the population lives hand to mouth. Parents keep children home from school to work in the fields. If there is a flood or a drought, people starve. A new factory would mean regular monthly salaries as well as protection against natural disasters or a sudden drop in the price of our main agricultural product, say, corn.

Regular salaries would allow families the confidence to make investments in their futures. The locals would be able to plan their finances accurately and free themselves from debt. This in turn would encourage entrepreneurship and further develop the local economy. People could begin to open shops, restaurants, dormitories, and entertainment facilities to serve the factory workers with their savings. Profits from these small enterprises would further enrich the local community and turn our relatively poor farmland into a truly profitable development zone. Perhaps more parents could then afford to send all of their children to high school and maybe even college.
entrepreneurship ［ˌa:ntrəprəˈnə:ʃip］n. 企业家的身份（地位）

There would certainly be negative effects as well. If the area becomes prosperous, immigrants from poorer regions will come here looking for work. Because of their relative poverty they will work harder for less money than the locals and drive wages down. There might be more immigrants than factory jobs available, leading to an unemployment crisis with a rising crime rate as a potential negative side effect.

On the other hand, the proposed factory would almost certainly have adverse effects on the local environment, particularly in regards to polluting the water. This is perhaps the most serious concern, because without clean water the area cannot sustain life of any kind, corn, livestock, or human.

However, because of the relatively desperate economic situation of my hometown, I believe the potential benefits of opening a new factory would outweigh the risks. If we take the proper precautions, such as imposing strict environmental standards and providing adequate social services for immigrants, the whole area stands to benefit.

3. The influence of movies or television on people's behavior

The impact that movies or television has had on our daily life, and society in general, is undeniable. No doubt it will become even greater as the scope of which continues to grow, and as the relevant technologies become more and more sophisticated, and so fascinating that virtually nobody will be able to escape. Already, it can be seen how western movies are exercising influence on our youth generation: they grow long-hair regardless of their gender, commonly part of which is dyed in gold; they wear jeans in each and every season, usually the knees of which are deliberately tattered; boys are fond of earrings or other odd pendants; and girls are keen on Marlboros and weird bad words.
pendant ［ˈpendənt］ n. 垂饰物  tattered ［ˈtætəd］ adj. 破旧的

The major means that movies and television influence the public is by creating topics of discussion in the society. Movies offer people (the consumers) issues to talk and think about. Titanic had brought a worldwide uproar by its extolling of fascinating immortal love; Prime Color and Wag the Dog met the national debate on the right and duty of the president of the United States. Antiwar movies such as Tears of the Sun and All Quiet on the Western Front among numerous others have been raising the question that is any war really to uphold justice or is it really worthy that an individual makes sacrifices to his country and at the same time ignores his own family or his personal values? Television also shapes our understanding of what is important and what is not important (to know). The"important" issues are being discussed over and over or in the beginning of a program. The "not important" stories are the ones that are not being told at all. The"not very important" stories are probably very short and hidden in the last part. By prearranging public issues, movies and television make decisions for us. Even though there are critical thinking individuals in any society, they are definitely in the minority; the public in whole indeed lack skills of critical thinking, and therefore they are often led by the movies and television.

In brief, movies and television, by offering topics and affecting the ways in which we discuss"the important issues", have a strong influence on our perception of the truth, of the world or of the structure of our society. We have to admit that it has a role in our lives as a source of information, experiences, entertainment, amusement and relaxation.
amusement ［əˈmju:zmənt］ n. 消遣  censorship ［ˈsensəʃip］ n. 审查制度

4. Staying in one place or moving in search of another place? 

While moving to a new place can be a traumatic experience, especially for children, I believe that in the end its benefits outweigh its drawbacks. Moving to a new place to live increases a person's understanding of the world, offers new challenges and opportunities, and does not preclude putting down deep roots at some point in the future. 
traumatic ［trɔ:ˈmætik］ adj. 痛苦难忘的 preclude ［priˈklu:d］ n. 排除

One of the greatest benefits of traveling is learning about a new and different place. Traveling to a new place to live deepens and enriches the sense of newness and learning that a visitor might feel. A new place means a new, perhaps different job, and new and different friends. Learning the diverse viewpoints of a new place not only presents totally new information; it also casts a new light on old viewpoints. Often moving to a new place teaches people more about the place that they are from. Old, seemingly mundane foods, customs, and language are suddenly new again viewed in the context of a radically different environment. Through comparisons of old and new places, friends, and ideas, people become more knowledgeable about the world and about themselves. 
cast a light on 使有新认识  mundane ［ˈmʌndein］ adj. 世俗的，平凡的  radically ［ˈrædikəli］ adv. 根本上  

A new place offers interesting possibilities for personal and professional development. Even though in a new place people lack deep connections, they also lack prejudices and rivalries. Often people move to new places to escape uncomfortable situations that have hampered their personal growth. If I have a long-standing feud with my neighbor, I might eventually move to a new place to start over in peace. New places naturally have their own local politics, but learning about them and finding a way to prosper is like starting life with a clean slate. Every opportunity is available to newcomers to pursue because the local people do not have preconceived ideas about them. 
hamper ［ˈhæmpə］ v. 妨碍，牵制   clean slate 清白的历史   feud ［fju:d］n. 不和， (部落或家族间的) 世仇   preconceived ［ˌpri:kənˈsi:vd］adj. 先入为主的  

Some people would say that truly settling down in one place and making deep and lasting connections is preferable to moving every few years. I say that true friendships can be maintained over distance, and that people will be happiest when they discover a place that is truly the best for them. How can people really know what place is best for them if they have only lived in one place and have no basis for comparison? Moving once, or even several times does not mean that a person can never settle down in one, but it does ensure that he/she truly likes and understands the place that he/she does settle down in.

5. Only people who earn a lot of money are successful?

China is host to over one billion people. While the majority of China's population is not rich; in fact, it is a very small percentage of people who hold the status of being wealthy. Does this mean that the vast majority of Chinese people are unsuccessful? The answer to this is irrefutably "no".

There are many measures of success, and money is one of them. However, money is far from the main measure of success. To prove this point, one need only consider the possibility that a man could be wealthy beyond belief, but not consider himself successful. Perhaps he inherited his money, and has done nothing of value in his life. Perhaps he earned the money through ill means. Whatever the situation, it is more than possible that a rich man could be considered unsuccessful, either by himself, or by others.

Many people believe that the main measure of success is happiness, rather than material goods. Without happiness, even a person with money, status and children would not be successful. However, a low paid schoolteacher might think he/she was very successful if he/she succeeded in getting children to learn their material well. Or perhaps a housewife, who makes no money of her own, would feel successful if she raised a healthy, well-adjusted child and kept her home looking wonderful.

It is also important to look at the difference between self-perceived success and one's success in the eyes of another person. Perhaps the outside world views a man as unsuccessful if he does not have a lot of money, but he views himself as very successful because of his achievements in life. Whose opinion is more important? I believe that if one thinks he/she is successful, then he/she is, no matter what other people say.

In conclusion, money is not the only measure of success. Anyone can be successful, whether they are rich or poor. What matters is how one views himself/herself; if one is proud of one's achievements in life, and feels that he/ she has lived a fulfilling life, then he/she is successful.

Facts vs Concepts and Ideas
Directions: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

It is a well-known tradition for students to dislike dates. Therefore, it seems that maybe they don't like learning facts, which seems harder than "just" understanding an idea or concept. 

Indeed, once you have understood the idea of something, theoretically, it remains in your mind, whereas facts are easily forgotten. You can then re use the concept you have learned before, only because you understood how it worked, why it was important, and so on. And, something very important for the students, if they don't really remember the exact words their teacher used to explain the concept, they can make up something of their own, which may still be accurate. 

On the contrary, you cannot do the same with facts. Facts, as it is implied, are precise, occurred in special situations, and were followed by special consequences. For example, you can explain to someone what is the concept of Epicure's philosophy, even if you don't really remember all the aspects of it, eventually your explanation may still be valuable for the other person. It is more complicated with facts; indeed, you cannot imagine how Henry 8th left the Catholic Church to create the Church of England, unless you know the facts, the dates, the consequences, and so on. 

As far as I am concerned, I think that facts are as important as concepts or ideas. Facts are needed to understand concepts, and concepts are needed to foresee facts' consequences, for example. 

Concepts may sometimes be too abstract for students, and the vocabulary generally used to explain a "concept" is not really words that we use in the life of everyday, and it may be a problem for some students. Here, facts can help the teacher (or the person explaining) making the ideas clearer for the others. 

To conclude, I would say that there is a very close relationship between understanding ideas and learning facts; none is more important than the other, and when you are studying, you need to do both to succeed.

The professor starts by saying that no memoir is completely accurate but she believes that the memoir of the Chevalier de Seingalt was fairly accurate and can be used as a valuable historical source. Though some critics disagree she is convinced that the memoir is accurate about it's details and has given considerable proof in her lecture. 

While living in Switzerland the Chevalier mentions that he was wealthy and that he would indulge in extravaganzas like parties and gambling. The new evidence that the Chevalier did, in fact, borrow money from Swiss merchants does not necessarily mean that he was poor. On the contrary the Professor theorizes that the Chevalier had a lot of assets as wealth and it would require time for him to convert the assets into readily usable currency. In such unfortunate circumstances where his vices would require immediate money he would borrow some, for the time being, only to pay them back later. Her theory is logical and sound. 

The second piece critics would like to disclaim as true is the count of all conversations with Voltaire which he recorded with accuracy in his memoir which was penned down years later. The professor puts forward the fact that the Chevalier would dutifully make a note of the entire length of the conversation every night after meeting with Voltaire. Such an act is confirmed by witnesses who saw the Chevalier refer to journals and notes while writing his memoir. 

The final piece is the account of the dramatic jail break from Venice where he used a piece of metal to create a hole in the roof and then escaped. Such an account, though hard to believe, might actually be true as the Professor points out to some Italian government records dating back to that time which shows repairs being carried out to the ceiling of the very same cell in which the Chevalier was imprisoned. 

Though it may seem a bit dramatic and over the top, on the outset, the Professor is convinced that the memoirs of the Chevalier were true and accurate and could be used as a historical reference towards eighteenth century Europe.

Question: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

Response A, Score of 5 

I remember every teacher that has taught me since I was in Kindergarten. If a friend wants to know who our first grade teacher was in elementary school, all they have to do is ask me. The teachers all looked very kind and understanding in my eyes as a child. They had special relationships with nearly each and every one of the students and were very nice to everyone. That’s the reason I remember all of them. 

A teacher’s primary goal is to teach students the best they can about the things that are in our textbooks and more important, how to show respect for one another. They teach us how to live a better life by getting along with everyone. In order to do that, the teachers themselves have to be able to relate well with students. 

My parents are teachers too. One teaches Plant Biology and one teaches English, but that’s not the reason I’m calling them “teachers.” They are teachers because they teach me how to act in special situations and how to cooperate with others. I have a brother, and my parents use different approaches when teaching us. They might scold my brother for surfing the internet too long because he doesn’t have much self-control and they need to restrain him. He almost never studies on his own and is always either drawing, playing computer games, or reading. On the other hand, they never tell me off for using the computer too long. I do my own work when I want and need to because that brings me the best results and my parents understand that. They know that I need leisure time of my own and that I’ll only play until needed. My parents’ ability to relate well with my brother and I allows them to teach, not just the subject they teach but also their excellent knowledge on life. 

Knowledge of the subject being taught is something taken for granted, but at the same time, secondary. One must go through and pass a series of courses and tests in order to become a teacher. Any teacher is able to have excellent knowledge of their subject but not all teachers can have the ability to relate well with students. 

A teacher’s primary goal is to teach students the best they can about how to show respect for one another, so teachers use different approaches when teaching, and knowledge of the subject being taught is secondary. For these reasons, I claim with confidence that excellent knowledge of the subject being taught is secondary to the teacher’s ability to relate well with their students.

Question: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

Response B, Score of 4 

I disagree with the idea that possessing the ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught for a teacher. There are several reasons why I disagree with that idea. 

First, teachers’ job is to educate their students with their knowledge. The ability to relate well with their student is something a counselor should possess, not a teacher. That’s why the board of education gives an award to a teacher with an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach. Teachers who can get along with their students but have no knowledge can be popular and be liked by his or her students, however I don’t consider a teacher with no knowledge a good teacher. 

Second, Students go to schools because they want to learn knowledge from their teachers not to get along with their teachers. I knew a math teacher who was well known among other mathematics teachers. Some students always complained how he never entertained his students which made many of his students fall asleep. Nevertheless, all of his classes were all full even before the semester began because many students who were eager to learn already booked in. He won the Apples prize (it’s given to a noticed teacher annually) a couple of times and that enabled students to firmly believe in his way of teaching. 

Thirdly, teachers are responsible for conceding their knowledge to their next generation. Teachers already had an experience of getting advantaged education from college. Teachers should not let that privilege become useless and workless. We all learn because we want to become the better person that this world needs. Students will also eventually grow up to be influencing other people and teachers should voluntarily be their students’ role models. 

For conclusion, I think the most important quality a teacher must have is an excellent knowledge of the subject they teach, not an ability to relate well with their students.
