Chapter 7, ZhengJiang

The most famous figure of those missionaries in China maybe James Hudson Taylor, who loves China and devoted himself to the mission of China. 

Taylor was born in 1832, and before he was born, his mother decided to offer him as God's servant of Chinese mission. After he grew up, he met some friends and got to know the information about Chinese mission, and waited for chance to go to preach the Gospel to 400 millions Chinese. 

Like Peter or Paul or Saint Augustine, Taylor has had loss his belief in God, but like Augustine, he returned to God again because of the prayer of his mother, and his older sister Amelia. To do the work of Chinese mission, he had done many preparations, such as Chinese study, medicine study, body exercise, and other preparations. 

Because he decided to go to China to preach the Gospel, he lost his betrothed girl, his father-in-law refused to give out his daughter to him, a man who decided to go to a poor, undeveloped land. After that, in 1853, Taylor joined into "The China Evangelisation Society", and became the first missionary to be sent to China on September, 19. 

On March 1st, 1854, Taylor arrived at Shanghai, China, when he was 22 years old. In November of the same year, he met Dr. William Parker and his wife with his children, then they worked together. To be close to Chinese, Taylor wear Chinese clothes and Chinese hair style, he is the first one missionary who became the same with Chinese. Because of his endeavors, his work got wonderful effect. 

In October 1856, Taylor left Shanghai and arrived at Ningbo, he lived with John Jones and worked together with him, but because of the different view points about Chinese mission and the deficit problem, Taylor exited from John Jones' Chinese Mission Committee and organized an independent committee called "Ningbo Mission Committee". Thus, the verse of "Yahweh-Jireh" and "Ebenezer" became his slogan, which means "Yahweh will prepare" and "Yahweh helped us until now". As his slogan, Taylor relied on nothing but Yahweh. 

In many difficulties there are some joyful things for Taylor, one important is that he met Maria Dyer and fell in love with her. Maria came to Ningbo in 1853, and as a teacher of one church female school which was built by Mary Ann Aldersey. On January 20, 1858, when Maria was 22 years old she married Taylor and both of them were dressing Chinese clothes, in next year, July, they had their first daughter, Grace Dyer Taylor. 

Taylor managed almost everything of his church and hospital, that made Taylor be sicken, and must return to his hometown England to get treatment On July 19, 1860. When he was in England to get treatment for his illness, he sent 5 missionaries to China include James J. Meadows. 

One important thing he had done when he was in London was the organization called "China Inland Mission". He opened an account as a foundation for this committee, and started to find funds. After he recovered from illness, Taylor went to China again with 16 missionaries on May 26, 1866. Although there was storm in his way, he arrived at Shanghai safely. 

When he was in China to do the holy work, there were many evil things fell upon him from his around Chinese, but the love of Christ in the heart of Taylor, made him show love instead to hate those Chinese. One most sad event was that he lost his children and his wife when he was in China. He buried his wife in ZhenJiang and returned to England to marry Jennie Faulding, who was one member of "China Inland Mission". 

There are five principles of "China Inland Mission": first is the member acceptance without distinction, whoever believes in Jesus and met the conditions can join in; Second is the objective of mission restricted in one reign; Third is the requirement that let them behave like Chinese; Fourth is not join into other movements such as the Boxer movement; Fifth is the more important thing, that is the enthusiasm of preaching gospel instead of his education; Sixth is the point of view about money, rely on willing support only; Seventh is the main purpose of their mission, that is to preach Gospel. 

The reasons made "China Inland Mission" success first is the freedom when Taylor was preaching gospel in China. Missionaries can go around China without restriction. The excellent ability in management of Taylor contributed to the success of his committee too. Moreover, although Taylor is a excellent man he still humble before God and rely on nothing but the believing in God to overcome all difficulties. Taylor was called "the benefactor of China Inland" and was loved by many Chinese. 

Taylor had said, "If I had a thousand pounds China should have it- if I had a thousand lives, China should have them. No! Not China, but Christ. Can we do too much for Him? Can we do enough for such a precious Saviour?" This became his most famous quote in his quotes. Taylor practiced his quote, not him, but his whole family, his son Frederick Howard Taylor, his grandson James II, and his third generation James III, forth generation James IV, all of them devoted themselves in the mission of China. He likes a grain of wheat, he died, but he bore many fruits. 

Through the history of Taylor's mission in China, we must agree that China owes him a lot. He suffered so many difficulties, not only by the nature, but also by the Chinese. Although he suffered so much, he still loves China, and devoted himself, not only himself, but his family to China, not to China, according to his quote, that's to Christ. Maybe this is the reason of his great love, although he was hurt by Chinese. 

The love of Christ helped Taylor to love Chinese, those unloveliness ones, those who are unworthy to be loved. But is this not the love of Christ? Yes, this is the love of Christ, who love those sinners, those worthless ones. Moreover, he gave us worth, that's his flesh and his blood, give out to us, that's our values. We have nothing beside this value from Christ, maybe we have money, we have car, we have house, we have many precious things of this world, but all of those are worthless, will be destroyed at once. Only the word of God will endures forever, his word, incarnated in this world, became flesh, that Jesus Christ. Like Taylor who devoted his life to China, but not for China, it's for Jesus Christ. Only in this way, can we become worthy man, and endures forever because of Him, Jesus Christ, the Word of God.
