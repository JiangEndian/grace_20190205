Chapter 8, Suzhou, the city in earth to be a heavenly city. 

Suzhou is a city in eastern China, in the province of Jiangsu, situated west of Shanghai on the Grand Canal. In ancient time, Suzhou was called Wujun, because it was the capital of the ancient Wu kingdom, and Suzhou is a famous place of China 10 main sightseeing spots. Suzhou is a beautiful city, described as a heavenly city in earth, said, "There is heavenly kingdom above, and there is Suhang below", to contrast this city with heavenly kingdom to express how beautiful is this city. 

Suzhou can be described as a city of water, there are many water ways in this city, more developed than land way. According to history, before protestant has preached gospel here, there was a Catholic missionary Matteo Ricci who came to Suzhou and stayed here for a while. In that period there were 10 people became believers. 

After the First Opium War, some harbor city was opened to outside, but still there were some restrictions of mission, and preaching gospel inland was forbidden. Afterward, the way to enter to inland to preach gospel was opened, but the reaction of inland was hostility. 

When it was Taiping heavenly kingdom movement inside, and western powers outside, Suzhou met Christianity again. In 1850, a protestant missionary started his mission in Suzhou, when it's not allowed to preach gospel openly. The name of above mentioned missionary was Charles Taylor, a missionary sent by South American Methodist Church, with B. Jenkins. The arrived at Shanghai first, and built church and their house to make a base for their mission. They preached gospel in Shanghai and Nanjing, afterward they went to Suzhou to do their mission, and Taylor was called Dai doctor at that time. In 1853, Taylor finished his 5 years life in China and returned to his country, further more, he wrote his experience of his life in Chan. 

The door of mission was opened after 1856, due to the Tianjin Treaty. In Tianjin Treaty, not only the harbor but also the inland was opened to missionaries to let them preach gospel freely. Although only Catholic was mentioned in this treaty, the Deputy Representative of America, who was a missionary, added "Protestant" in this treaty to grant the same right as Catholic, and the place was expressed as "Harbor and other places" in this treaty. Thus, protestant got the right to preach gospel inland. 

After Tianjin Treaty, missionaries have the right to go to Suzhou to preach gospel legally. One important figure was J. W. Lambuth, he entered Suzhou in 1859. According to the diary of Wangtao, before March 1859, the mission was started in Suzhou already. In his diary, he mentioned about Griffith John, a pastor of London mission committee, came to China with his wife in 1855, and preached gospel in China for 51 years, was called "the Father of the mission of Central China" and "the Apostle of Central China". 

Suzhou was captured by Taiping armies in June, 1860, in that time, Tarleton Perry Crawford, James L. Holmes, J.B. Hartwell and other missionaries came to Suzhou to meet the leader of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and was welcomed by LiShusong. After that, more missionaries came to Suzhou to meet HongXiuquan and LiShusong, those missionaries think they are true believers of Christianity, and they wanted to make Jiangsu province to become a christian city. But afterwards, those missionaries found out that the leaders of Taiping were not good partners in mission, and they left each other, became enemies finally. After the fall of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in Suzhou, until 1863, missionaries did go to Suzhou again. 

But there are some merits of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, because their policy, they were supported by the people in Suzhou, and this point made contributions to the mission of preaching gospel. 

Another important missionary work was documentary work. One important figure in this area was a North American Presbyterian Church missionary, George F. Fitch, who came to China in 1870 and preached gospel in Suzhou and Ningbo. He built the "American Presbyterian Mission Press" and published many christian books. Those books were circulated in Suzhou and the readers increased more and more, it helped those poor a lot to understand Christianity. 

After Qing government recovered Suzhou, many people came back from Shanghai and started to rebuild Suzhou. In this period many missionaries work with them in the area of medical and education. An important missionary was James William Lambuth, a believer of South American Methodist Church. Lambuth came to Suzhou and met a man called "A man who make button called Li", the man who make button baptized with children and became believers. Afterward when Lambuth went to Suzhou to preach gospel, he lived in his home. Furthermore, the man who make button became a pastor and was welcomed by many Chinese. 

Another man who walked with Lambuth was CaoZhishi, who was an orphan and was adopted by Lambuth and his wife Mary Isabella McClellan when they met in Shanghai. After been an adoptive son of Lambuth, he was taught Bible and understood thanks and grace, thus he became a christian and the church of Lambuth became his home. 

CaoZhishi went to America with his adoptive parents and lived in America for 10 years. When he returned to China, he arrived at Shanghai and worked with Lambuth together. Lambuth and his wife sent him as a missionary, thus CaoZhishi came to Suzhou in 1870 and use a house of his friend, a christian, as his preaching place. This place became the first base of mission of America Methodist. CaoZhishi did his mission and heal those ills and teach those students who have no chance to study. 

CaoZhishi started as a orphan and became a missionary afterward, furthermore he became an excellent family because he married YanZhenqin's sister. He praise God who made him and gave him so many grace, and the family of YanZhenqin who embrace CaoZhishi with charity even an orphan he was moved us.
