Chapter 11, Hefei, the site with incalculable tear. 

Hefei is the capital of Anhui province, which located in eastern China. Although Hefei is not a coast city, there was the footstep of Christianity from 13th century. In the end of the Yuan dynasty, there was a record about the existence of Nestorius, in a book of the building of Hefei. This is the oldest record of Christianity in Hefei. 

In the early Qing dynasty, there were many places to play roles as the base of mission in Anhui province, such as Wuhe, Anqing, Cizhou, Huizhou, etc. The day of mission in Anhui came a little late than Beijing or other southern coast cities, and started from the cities beside the canal of Jinghang and Yangzi River. 

There is a city beside Yangzi River called Anqing, because it's close to Nanjing, Anqing was influenced a lot by Nanjing. From 1701, Anqing became a subordinate base of mission of Nanjing by the missionaries of Francisco.Afterward, a missionary of France prepared Cizhou as a base, and there were many denominations came to Anhui getting base to preach the Gospel. 

After the 1st Opium War, the treaty of Nanjing, Wangxia and Huanpu were established, and the activity of preaching gospel was allowed according to the detailed items, but still, the government of the Qing dynasty held a hostile attitude towards missionaries. Moreover, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement occurred, narrowed the way of missionaries. After the ending of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, Catholic Jesuit started the mission in Anhui, until 1908, they have built 406 Catholic churches in many cities of Anhui. 

Protestant came after Catholic, started by John the son of Robert Morrison, and in 1844, the Anglican of America came to Anhui and Jiangshu province to preach the Gospel. After 1855, many other denominations of Protestant came to Anhui to start mission, especially in 1880, the fever of mission occurred in America  unparalleled in history, many young adults came out to preach the Gospel after they graduate from university. Thus, in the early 19th century, there were many missionary groups from 8 countries include France, America, Germany, and Italy came to Anhui province to start their mission. 

Among those missionary groups, one important missionary group who did the real mission in Anhui was Inland Mission Committee of Hudson Taylor, they came to Anqing prepared a base of mission, and built many churches in Anhui. But there churches couldn't continue for a long time, and was destroyed the the group who hates Christianity. Although there were many persecutions, missionary James J. Meadows still worked fervently in many places of Anhui and prepared many base of mission. The work of mission in Anhui experienced many difficulties. 

On tragedy events in Anhui was the event of Anqing. In 1869, there was an exam in the administration of Anqing, and to avoid the collision between missionaries and examinee, the official of Anqing administration found Meadows and Williamson and reminded them. But because they lack the knowledge of China, they didn't care about the word of the official, thus caused serious collision between them and those examinee. Moreover, the movement of anti-Christianity expanded around the whole China, let the collision more serious. But it's the fact that those missionaries in that age, stirred the emotion of the citizens of Anqing, prohibited them to commemorate their ancestors and Confucius, and disregarded local laws, provided a reason of this collision. 

The collision started in Anqing, and expaned to Jiande, a city face to Anqing in the other side of Yangzhi River, caused 22 death of christian, this was called the Event of Jiande. Because of those events, the English government drove their battleship to Anqing and rebuked those officials, to let them make a compensation, arrest those leader. The French government followed the footstep of English government to ask a huge amount of compensation, and pressed the government of the Qing dynasty by military force with an excuse of "protection of the right of mission". But the emotion of hate the Christianity occurred repeatedly, although there were many devotions of missionary groups such as Medical Mission and Education Mission, the threaten of military force stained the fame of those missionaries to with a disgrace name of "the agent of invader". 

The Gospel came to China with military force, let me think of the word of Jesus, who came without any military force, even in the cross. Although he can ask Father to send him more than twelve legions of angels, he didn't do it, he came just for salvation. With military force, the gospel will be preached easily, maybe Peter was thinking in this way so he cut the ear of a servant to act as the military force of Jesus, but Jesus didn't allow Peter to do such thing and healed the servant. This is Jesus, this is the Gospel. 

The Gospel came with military force will be preached easily, at least will be preached freely. But when the military force withdrew, the gospel will be hated and feared by the local military. The missionary was described as the agent of invader, moreover, the Gospel was described as the weapon of invader too. When the military power of gospel was strong enough, the gospel will be preached well, but after the military power faded, or the local military power which was been oppressed, became strong enough to beat back, they will oppress the Gospel who had oppress them. However, although Jesus came without any military power, the Gospel was persecuted too. Maybe the "Best of all possible worlds" theory of Leibniz is one hidden truth of God, in all possibilities, God has given us the best one. Current situation seems not good enough though, without the irresistible grace of God it would be worsen 10 thousand times more.
