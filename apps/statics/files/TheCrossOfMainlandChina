Chapter 12, Taiwan, the island of twilight of the Ming and Qing dynasty. 

Taiwan is an island off the south east coast of China, whole area of Taiwan is 36,192 square meter. The first missionary of Taiwan was pastor Georgius Candidius of Dutch Reformed Churches, he came to Taiwan at May 4th, 1627. Thus some ones think the first missionary of China was not Robert Morrision but Georgius Candidius. 

Georgius Candidius was born in Germany, but his mother is a Scottish, and to avoid the Thirty Years' War, they moved to Holland, where is the base of reformed church. After he graduated from seminary he became a pastor, and devoted himself to foreign mission, finally he went to Taiwan because of the decision of East India Company, by which Taiwan was occupied. 

Georgius Candidus met the natives and organized his knowledge to publish a book called "A shout description of the Isles of Formosa" in December 1628. He started his activities in 1629, with pastor Robertus Junius, and built a school in 1636 to teach alphabet and christian doctrine. The result of his efforts were 120 believers, but he didn't baptize anyone because he thought their faith is not enough. This period from 1624 to 1643 was the former part of his mission. 

Pastor Robertus Junius and his wife preached the monogamy concepts to those natives, and until they return to Holland, there were 6,400 believers bapitized, and there were 1,000 marriage was proved. 

The latter part of Candidus's mission was from 1643 to 1662. Before he went to Jakarta in 1631, he baptized 50 natives, and thus they became the first believers of Protestant. He came back to Taiwan in 1633, and after he return to his country he couldn't came to Taiwan again. He left this world in April 1647. 

After the Second Opium War, those western powers established Tianjin treaty with China, as a result, many cities include Taiwan were opened to foreigners, and the freedom of mission was guaranteed. Because of this treaty, the Christianity and missionary was thought as the agent of western nations and their work experienced many difficulties. However, because of the boom of foreign mission in Europe and America, many missionaries dedicated themselves to the mission. 

After Taiwan was opened, Catholic started their work quickly, a priest of Dominican came to Taiwan in 1859 and built Catholic churches in many places. The Presbyterian of England came to Taiwan in September 1860 to preach the Gospel, they sent many missionaries to explore some places of Taiwan and decided their work place. 

The Presbyterian of England started their medical mission, sent the missionary James L Maxwell, who graduated as a doctor majored in medical department in 1860. Maxwell started his mission at June 16, 1865, this is the resumption of christian mission of Taiwan after 200 years from the year of Candidius. Thus this day became a anniversary of Taiwan's mission. 

Maxwell made many efforts on medical mission. When he was in Taiwan, in 2,000,000 people of Taiwan, there were more than 500,000 man smoking opium, Maxwell strove to cure those men. Maxwell worked not only on medical mission, but also on documentary mission, he used English alphabet to express the language of Min Nan and published the Bible of Min Nan. Thus the Presbyterian of England sent more missionaries to Taiwan, to many races, in many places. 

The mission of northern part of Taiwan started a little later than southern part. In the end of 19th century, with the development of the northern part of Taiwan, the activities of missionaries were started. Pastor George Leslie Mackay of Presbyterian of Canada arrived at Kaohsiung at 29 December 1871, after studied the language and the custom, he started his pioneer work in northern area. Pastor Mackay worked in the northern area of Taiwan for 30 years, built 60 churches and many clinic, cultivated 2 local pastors, 60 evangelists, 24 women evangelists, and 2,633 believers. That's the trace and the result of his efforts. 

The Chinese-Japanese War started at July 25 1894, because of the failure of China, Shimonoseki treaty was established, as the result, Taiwan and the islands of Penghu became colonies of Japan. However, there were some christian and missionaries helped the armies of Japan, let Christianity be hated by many others. 

In the beginning of their colonization, they gave freedom to many areas to conciliate Taiwan's natives, and thus the churches of Taiwan growth double from 1895 to 1905. However booming lasted just for a while. 

After 1931, the militarism of Japan revealed, and they started their suppressive policy. In 1937, they forced christian to join their movement and forced them to worship their shrine and many other persecutions. Because this oppression, many churches, schools, and hospitals were shut down. After 1940, many missionaries were driven out to their own country, and in 1944, there are many seminaries were closed. So after 1944, the churches of Taiwan started to be independent by not their will but force. 

After the Second World Was finished in August 1945, Taiwan was liberated from Japan. But the Second Chinese Civil War started, and then Taiwan was occupied by Jiang Jieshi's national party. After the foundation of modern China, a socialism nation, most foreign missionaries were persecuted and left from China inland to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, to continue their mission. As a result, the Christianity of Taiwan developed greatly, the number of believers were 37,000 when it's liberated, but until 1960, there were 380,000 believers increased, 10 times more than 15 years ago. Until 2018, according to a report of Taiwan, there were 4,409 churches, and all believers were 1,540,000. 

The persecution in China inland drove out those missionaries, it's sad for the mission of China inland and those missionaries, but it's a good news for Taiwan and other independent province of China. Although it seems bad, but it's best indeed. God has given us the best world which we don't deserved. 

The same situation is in our religious life, sometimes we were persecuted, and we must change ourselves, lost many things, such as those missionaries lost their mission of China inland. But the lost is not a lost forever, in the hands of God, the lost is for the future gain, in another way. It's difficult to preach gospel in China inland, but God has given us the best world. Without the grace of God, maybe the whole China inland will be given up, even no one can be saved. But today, there are many Chinese be saved although they are in China inland, I'm one of them. Thanks be to God, for he saved me as a remnant.
