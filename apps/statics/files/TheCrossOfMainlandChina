Chapter 9, Hangzhou, the city of water touch with sky. 

Hangzhou is the capital of Zhejiang province in eastern China, a beautiful city of water, have the same fame with Suzhou, described as a heavenly city on earth. In the process of communication with foreign countries, the religion of Christianity was preached here as in Suzhou. 

Early to 1325, there was a Italian missionary called Friar Odoric traveled to China and wrote a memoir about his journey, according to his memoir, there were many Nestorius Christian in Hangzhou in that age. The denomination of Christianity called Nestorius separated the incarnate Christ as two persons, one human and one divine. This denomination was preached in Hangzhou in 1278 to 1282, and a missionary of this denomination built 7 churches in Zhenjiang and Hangzhou. 

In September, 1583, the end of the Ming dynasty, a Italian priest of Jesuit called Michele Ruggieri came to Hangzhou and became the first missionary. Although he did just a little work in Hangzhou, the effect influenced many ones, and his work was ended due to the summon of Vatican in 1607. 

After Michele Ruggieri, there was Matteo Ricci, who came to China in 1859, and worked in many cities of China. He was a Catholic, and to help the mission of Catholic in China, he met many Chinese intellectual, one of them was LiZhizao, he's also one of "The three cornerstone of Chinese Catholic". 

Matteo Ricchi died in May, 1610, in Beijing, and in the end of this year, Niccolo Longobardi became the chairman of Chinese diocese. Thus, when LiZhizao in the way to his hometown, he met the new missionary and asked help for the mission of Hangzhou. Then Niccolo sent priest to Hanzhou. Those priests came to Hangzhou and offered the first mass in LiZhizao's home and started their mission. Afterward, there were more missionaries came to Hangzhou and preached the gospel. 

There were many ones became believers in Hangzhou, one of them called YangTingjun, who used to be a believer of Buddhism but became a believer of Christianity afterwards. He offered the Buddhism temple in his home to built a church to worship called "Savior's Church". He and his wife believed and were baptized and to express thanks, they bought the place where those missionaries stayed temporarily, to present it to Jesuit. 

Because of the persecution of Nanjing in 1616 to 1617, LiZhizao went to Beijing, and YangTingjun stayed in Hangzhou to help those missionaries, he hided in his home, let his home became a refuge of those missionaries in Hangzhou. 

After the persecution of Nanjing, LiZhizao backed to Hangzhou to concentrate on the western study and the work of translation. According to the report of Jesuit, the number of Catholic believers in Hangzhou in 1621 was 300. 

Savior's Church attracted not only believers but also the emperor of the Qing dynasty. That was in March, 1699, when Kangxi Emperor was inspecting Jiangnan the third time, the Italian missionary Emmanuel Laurifice went from Hangzhou Catholic Church to meet him. They dealt a feast in the ship of emperor, some other missionaries such as Jean Francios Gerbillon and Joachim Bouvet joined too. Thus the Catholic church was rebuilt, and "Rebuilt by the command of Emperor" was inscribed at main gate. 

It's the same situation with today's missionary, the missionary from richer, foreign country was respected more. Gospel was preached from poor to rich at first, but afterward, the mission of Gospel was preached from rich to poor, and those rich missionary was respected more than those poor missionary. One instance was my experience in a Korean seminary in China, those pastors from Korea was respected more by students, and those teachers from China was disdained by our students, although themselves are Chinese too. I don't know why, but that is it. 

Another important figure was Martino Martini, an Italian Catholic, a priest of Jesuit and an expert of China studies. He was sent to China in 1638 as a missionary, but returned because of the storm. He departed again in 1642, and arrived at China in 1643 and started his mission of China. He came to Hangzhou when he was 29 years old and started his mission there. 

Martino Martini changed his name to "JiTai" to express the meaning of "Saving China". He was attacked once by the armies of the Qing dynasty, after he showed his identity, he was brought to a Catholic Church in Hangzhou and was commanded to work there, with the cloth of the army of the Qing dynasty and wear a long hair. 

Martino Martini was summoned to leave China and return to Vatican in 1650, to discuss weather the culture of worshiping ancestor and Confucius is idolatry or not. Thus, he returned to Vatican, and said the culture of worshiping ancestor and Confucius is not idolatry but just a culture of Chinese. Vatican accepted his opinion, think this is not a religious problem. But also, there were still some fundamentalists disagree with him and influenced the mission of China by a negative way. 

After 1656, Martino Martini brought more missionaries to Hangzhou and started his missionary work again. But before the construction of Savior's Church was finished, he died, on June, 6th, 1661, when he was 48 years old. He was buried in DaFangJing Catholic Church in Hangzhou. He was remembered by many Chinese. 

Because of the prohibition to worship ancestors and Confucius, preaching gospel in China became difficult. and was forbidden by Kangxi Emperor. Afterward, those missionaries was deported by other emperors, and many churches was closed too. Thus the mission of Hangzhou stopped during the period between the first Opium war and the establishment of the Treaty Of Nanjing. 

From the history of Christianity in Hangzhou, we can find the importance of acceptance of others' culture. As the saying of Paul, "I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some". The salvation of souls is more important than some trivial conceptions, such as the culture of worshiping ancestors and Confucius. In my opinion, like a fundamentalist, I think this culture is idolatry in face, but that's the things after salvation, without salvation of Jesus Christ, we can't be saved although we have no idolatry. 

The first and most important thing is the salvation of Jesus Christ, that means preaching the name of Jesus and let others believe in his name. Thus the way of preaching gospel will not be closed and the gospel will not be abhorred by others who are unbelievers. The truth shall be taught to those believers, and the truth will be abhorred by unbelievers eventually. But at the first stage, the emphasis is on the surviving problems. Jesus is the savior, but he was brought to escape to Egypt to survive in this world at his childhood. After he became an adult, he preached the truth and was abhorred by others, and was killed on cross. The Gospel, has the same fate with himself, Jesus Christ. 

He has resurrected, and ascended to heaven, and he will come again to judge the world. The gospel, the judge.
