Chapter 6, Nanjing, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement and the beginning of modern China. 

The dream of those missionaries who came into China mainland, is to preach the Gospel around the whole China. But this dream be explained by a wrong way and lead to revolution in China and killed many people, the man risen the revolution was HongXiuquan, and his explanation of the kingdom of heaven in the earth was his "the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom". 

HongXiuquan lost in an exam in 1836, and he got the book of "QuanShiLiangYan" from a missionary, but he didn't care of this at first. After he lost again and again in the exam of imperial examinations, he had no way but back to his hometown. He sicked severely in his hometown for 40 days, and in that period he thought of the book which he had gotten, he saw something is alike with the content of this book in his dream, he understand something by himself and became a christian. He has had studied a little doctrine of Christianity from a pastor, but did not understand it wholly, thus he designed the idea of "the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" by his experience and his lust. 

HongXiuquan called the Father "Heavenly Father" and called Jesus as the firstborn of God, further more he called himself a brother of Jesus Christ. He use the complaint of people and built "the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and allied with another community called "Heaven and Earth Community". Thus he started from the Southwest China and conquered many place of China. Finally he conquered Nanjing in March, 1853 and killed 30,000 soldiers of the Qing dynasty. He changed the name of Nanjing to "Tianjing" which means "the city of heaven", started his "the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom", the fulfillment in the earth of the kingdom of heaven written in Bible, and he marched toward Beijing. 

HongXiuquan couldn't conquer Beijing and defeated by the armies of the Qing dynasty. He tried to ask help from the pastor who has had taught him in 1860, but because he called himself as the brother of Jesus and let the pastor admit this, the pastor left him, thus he suicide with poison, and Nanjing was conquered in July, 1864, that's means the ending of "the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" within 15 years. 

Shunwen, ShunZhongsan was a different figure with HongXiuquan, he overthrew the old China and prepared the modern China, also he was a christian. Shunwen was born in 1866, as a youngest son of a poor peasant family, with the help of his oldest brother, he lived in China until he was 12 years old and afterward he went to the place Hawaii where his oldest brother lived. He met the western culture in Hawaii and started to understand the world. He entered Iolani College in 1879, and grew from a country boy to be a man who has global views. After he graduated from above one college, he entered into Oahu College, he was asked to become a christian in this school, but be prevented by his oldest brother who believes in Confucianism. Thus he backed to China in 1883, and found that China is so different with Hawaii where he has had lived. 

Sunwen was baptized and became a christian in November, 1883 with his friends by pastor Charles Hager. He entered into The Central School in April 1884, most of his friends in the revolution movements were Christian. He tried to save the world as a physician, and opened his pharmacy in Macao, 1893, but he decided to concentrate on revolution with his friends in 1895. Finally he combined the power in China and out of China and started the revolution and built the "Republic of China" as the first president. His dream is to be a man like Moses who released Israel from Egypt, or Jesus who saved human from the sins. He thought that his revolution is the fire but the his religion is the oil which makes the fire blaze. He glorified God by his revolution, he said that the success of revolution rely on the grace of God. He died in 1925, and was buried in Nanjing, 1929. He is called the "Founding Father" by all Chinese. 

The foundation of modern China was built by Sunwen, but the foundation of modern China's church was built by DingGuanxun. DingGuanxun was born in 1915, a christian family of Shanghai, his grandfather was a pastor of Anglican and his mother was a faithful christian. As a tradition of church, he was baptized when he was just 4 months, and he attend church to worship every week. Thus he received christian education from his childhood. When he went to St. John's College, his major was civil engineering, and his father hoped him to become an excellent engineer. However he transferred to Arts to study English and Theology after 1 year, and became a pastor after he graduate in 1942. He was elected as the dean of Nanjing Concord Theological Seminary in 1952 when he was 37 years old, afterward he decided to the cultivation of a pastor who take care of religion and nation both. He became a bishop of Anglican in 1955. He partook in the building of Amity Foundation as a main role. In 1986, The United Bible Societies and The Amity Printing Company was built and became the main printing office in China to print all current versions of the Bible. He died in 2012, Nanjing, at his 98. 

A special American woman who has had lived in China and written the book "Earth" about Chinese life was Pearl Sydenstricker Buck. She was a writer, a humanist, a feminist, and a missionary of Presbyterian. She entered into China when she was 3 months with his missionary parents, and lived in ZhenJiang for 18 years. She thought Chinese is her first language. Her life in HuaBei was the material of her works including "Earth". 

In the building process of modern China, which called "People's Republic of China", there are many christian as the main roles, such as ShunWen, the Founding Father of modern China. From the history, we can easily find out that the Christianity changed the whole world, regardless of ancient or modern world. The power of God's word affect the world in a hidden way we can hardly get it, but through the history we can easily find out it. The word of God, contained in the religion called Christianity, has enormous power. 

In the national level, God's word has such power, let alone the individual level. In our life, the word of God seems useless or powerless, just a word without any power, however the word of God affect us and change us by a secretive method. He changed our mind, changed our life, and even changed the whole world. The word of God, incarnated in the flesh of human, he is Jesus. The Christianity which created by Jesus and his disciples, influenced the earth. No matter in ancient China or modern China, the religion of Christianity will affect and change the nation. Although it seems there are many persecution in China mainland, we believe that God's will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. The name of God be kept holy.
