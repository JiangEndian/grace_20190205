Chapter 13, Shenyang, the first Korean Bible and the spring wind of Manchurian Field. 

Shenyang is a city located in the north east part of China, is an important industrial city, and was a Manchurian city between the 17th and early 20th centuries, it is now the capital of the province of Liaoning. 

The gate of the Gospel in north east China was Yingkou, which is an open harbor towards the outside. Thus the culture of Christianity flowed into the north east of China through this harbor. Until today, there are many missionaries located in Yingkou, and the seminary which I have attended was located in Yingkou too. 

An opening gate is so important, not only for a city, but also for a man. Without an opening gate, one city can't revive, without an opening heart for a man, one cannot be a living man. As the breath of life breathed into the nostrils of Adam, then he became a living soul. 

Thus Yingkou became a living place for the Gospel, and many denominations came into this place. In 1852, the missionaries of protestant of Germany, England, France came to Yingkou to start preaching the Gospel. In 1866, the Committee of Mission of London came to Yingkou to start their mission and wrote the first chapter of Presbyterian. Moreover, in 1868, a pastor from Scotland came to Yingkou and started his mission. Thus there were many missionaries,and there were many churches in Yingkou. 

One important figure among those missionaries was Dugald Christie, a missionary who came from Scotland, built the first Red Cross Hospital of China, to cure those people who were injured in the Chinese-Japanese War in 1895. 

Because Yingkou was occupied by Japanese armies, there were many military men and citizens who came to this hospital, thus this hospital took a role of shelter in 1895. Missionary Dugald Christie hung a sign of "English Residence" and "Foreign Church" to protect this hospital and take care of those injured men and citizens. For his great kindness, the Qing government awarded a medal to those men like Dugald Christie after the Chinese-Japanese war finished. 

The Black Death has prevailed once in the north east of China, in this epidemic, missionary Dugald Christie also made great efforts to China. And because of his efforts, the Black Death in north east China was defeated. He deserves the admiration of China and many other countries. 

Along with the expansion of the China Mission, the activity of missionaries expanded too, from the coastal cities to the inland cities, Yantai was flooded by Gospel too. 

The first missionary of Yantai was Alexander Williamson, a missionary of the Committee of Mission of London, who came into Yantai with his wife on November 24, 1855. Along with the work of preaching the Gospel, he also did the culture mission such as the work of translation and writing books. His famous translation work was a book called "Element of Botany" of modern China and a western book explaining those new western concepts. His wife built a girls' school for those poor girls. 

Another figure we should talk about was John Livingstone Nevius. Although his work was not centered on Liaoning and Shenyang, because of his great influence to Korean mission we should look at this missionary. After Nevius graduated from university in 1848, he studied in Princeton Seminary to become a missionary. 

His family was a farming family, thus Nevius taught the skill of fruit growing to Chinese. Because he thought the climate and soil of Sangdong was similar to America's, he brought to Chinese the seeds of apple, grape, pear, and others. Thus Nevius was called the "Father of Yantai Apple". 

Nevius walked about 965 kilometers to preach the Gospel,and in the Great Famine of China in 1877, he gathered 7,600 funds and built a food distributing station, to give food to those starved men to save their life. 

In that period, there were many young missionaries working in Korea, and to preach the Gospel, they brought a translated Korean Bible to do their work. To do a more efficient work they invited Dr. Nevius, thus Nevius came into Korea. After the discussion with those missionaries of Presbyterian, he gave out his opinion: Self-Supporting, Self-Governing, Self-Propagating, the Three-Self Church. After receiving the tactics of Nevius those missionaries made the church of Korea grow quickly, and the Three-Self principles were also used as the base of Chinese Church's Three-Self Movement. 

Another missionary related closely with Korean Bible was John Ross, he came into Manchuria when he was 30, and he arrived at Yingkou first. When he was studying Chinese, he preached the Gospel and cured those businessmen and officials who were addicted to Opium. When Ross was working in northeast China, he devoted himself to the Korean Bible translation work and the mission of Korea. 

In the north east of China, there are many Korean. Because of the famine they came to Manchuria to live. And because of the persecution of Japan, more Korean immigrated to the three northeast provinces of China, and thus the population of Korean increased greatly there. 

One Korean who helped Ross to translate the Korean Bible was BaiHongjun, after he studied in a seminary he became the first protestant missionary of Korea, and worked in many places to gather people and preach the Gospel. And he was the first martyr of Korea. However, the Korean church and believers became more and more. 

Northeast China is a special place, as for me, is very special, because my life changed there, more specifically, in Yingkou, where I studied theology for the first time. Before I went to north east China, when I was living in the middle of China, I knew nothing about other races of China, but just know that China has 56 races from a song. After I went to north east China, I met other races, such as Korean, Mongolia, and Manchu. 

Because I went to a place with an opening gate, my eyes were opened too. Thanks be to God, although I'm just wanting to study theology, he taught me more, even a foreign language of Korean. And not only the more knowledge, but also the more expanded eyesight, I was given the chance to study in Korea, and thus, I came here, Kosin University. Thanks be to God, for he treats me so gracefully, to those who love God, God gives them the grace they cannot even just imagine. God is good, for those he loves, for those who love him. He first loved me, I love him. 

My God, the image of my God.
