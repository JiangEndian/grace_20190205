When, where, what, why, who, how. 
Today is Sunday, 8 March, 2021, the day of the Lord, and I went to church at noon, after I back to dormitory, I found an email from professor Chon in my Gmail inbox. It's about the scholarship which is made personaly by that professor. I am very appraciate that scholarship, for it helded me to pass the coldest days of my Kosin life. 
After replying the email of our professor, I wrote another email to my adoptive mother to tell her that email I have received about scholarship. And then, I slept about 90 minutes, wake up by our office girl who came here to paste some notice of dormitory rules in the back of every room's door. Thus, I got up and started study. 
In the evening, I had a inspired conversation with my brother in his room. And I learnt that I shall not judge others about their affairs, they tell me such thing just for share themselves to me, but not put themselves under my judgement. There is only one have the authority to judge, the Lord, and all of us will be put udner his judgement in the last day. 
I found that my brother is a practical man, for I saw his sermon put on his desk, which has the six W: Who, When, Where, What, Why, How. Many of us know this, but rarely use it. I learnt practical spirit from my brother. Thanks God, for he put such a good brother beside me.
