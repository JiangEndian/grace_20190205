Here’s what’s been addressed thousands of times and yet still a lot of people do not understand:
China’s a civilization state, and thus CCP is seen as the embodiment of the guardian of the civilization;
Being a member of the CCP means you are the enforcer of the materialized guardian imbued with the administrative power AND corresponding responsibility to protect the civilization and the people who may stand in need;
This is why people in China generally respect the government officials, police officers, and the armies coz they are protected, and in return, they give their highest regards;
Hence, in time of need, CCP members will work overtime and fight for the people on voluntary basis (partly coz they are asked to as well), coz they have been given the highest duty and honor, not for the sake of the CCP or the government, but for protecting the people they interact everyday. This is a cultural sense of responsibility that mindsets of nation states would not be able to understand unless they have in-depth knowledge of the contemporary Chinese history.



I think people have to stop thinking of CCP as A political party.

It is the very fabric and structure of Chinese bureaucracy, in a way it is a huge corporation, with the average Chinese citizens its customers. Join the party, climb the corporate ladder, you may find much satisfaction (and possibly material rewards) at the top, but the way is fraught with dangers…

I'd like to think of the average Chinese citizen an employee of the corporate in a non-managing position. This explains why some people who hate the CCP for “oppression” put up with much more oppressive policies their employers enforce in their companies - they didn't realize that Chinese people are the same to themselves - they put up with whatever restrictions there might be because they are in it for something, like those who put up with oppressive company management and terrible bosses.

This is not to say Chinese government is oppressive or terrible. Compare the percentage of people supporting the central government with the approval rate of company management on any job seeking web site and you will get an idea of how good the management of the “China corporation” is.

It’s easy to counter argue with election.

If election is so great, let’s choose a new leader for Facebook amazon and google.

Cause you know we all pay them tax(revenue).


. Pastors are businessmen. Their product is “salvation”. When they see proof their “product” does not work, in order to save their business and keep people like you under their control, they have to come up with a story to save their belief system or their business. In this case, the only possible story is that the deity is doing it on purpose.

"men are seen as sexual objects by women for their penis, muscle structure, and social status.

its called human nature. to suggest only men objectify the other for sexual purposes, is literally a simple minded lie"

"there are so many dumbasses who didnt get the message behind this huh. this picture is showing how women are mostly viewed as a sexual object due to their breasts and vagina. the woman in the picture thinks that if she gives them those then she wont be seen as as an sexual object anymore and be left alone. this is very sad honestly, humans are known to be the most intelligent animals and still the mindsets of some of them are so fucked up."

"This is exactly why governments don’t work all the time. I watched a video of a Vietnam veteran getting arrested for “self defence” when he really disarmed a man with a gun and beat him in the head. Police had no idea what happened until video footage was released so he made a huge deal over being the only one arrested, even though he was the last with the gun, beat a guys head with it and was acting fidgety.

He was arrested because of protocol but every single comment on the video was complaining because he was the “hero"

"Evil people have used religion to hurt others for as long as humanity has existed.

This even applies to Atheists, who have persecuted and killed millions of the religious in order to seize power. The greatest example of this is Communist Russia, China and North Korea who have persecuted millions of the religious.

It doesn’t matter what your religious belief is, wether you believe in God or nothing. People will always use their beliefs to abuse others to seize power."

"Why is religion such a painful topic for many people?
Because evil people see religion as an opportunity to use and abuse people."

when you come to a fallen tree on the path, step on it, and then step over it. He explained that snakes often rest under trees, so if we stepped right over a tree, we might startle the snake and get bitten. But if we stepped on the tree and then over it, we’d create enough distance to evade the strike of most snakes. 

Through prayer we “resist the devil” and “draw near to God” (James. 4:7–8).
