他是因为有他特别钟意的人，他宁愿等待，宁愿费事费时间。Fri 03 Sep 2021 03:25:03 PM KST ，想到会长让雪利给拿礼物给新生的。嗯。所以我在教授没说话想着帮忙，他就阻止了吧。我这过分了。因为教授可能有他钟意的人，他宁愿等待，宁愿费事费时间。

一个人的时间是有限的。每个人只有24小时一天。如果他外表搞的特别精致，我还指望他的内容好，那就过分了。。。Tue 07 Sep 2021 10:41:12 PM KST ，看旷野之声，标题起的高雅大气，视频做的花里胡哨，内容却是，除了以同样的手段反复的卖我们的时间来搞钱，没有别的了。唉。金钱，腐败了这个组织。太可怕了。他们或许还不知道吧，因为是慢慢的。
我不应该指望花里胡哨的东西还能有很多内容，除非，投入的时间及成本，在花里胡哨的东西之外，还能有足量的投入给内容。。。但有内容的人，真不在意花里胡哨的东西，因为会影响内容。而专注于花里胡哨，也真不能静下来搞内容。不可能兼得的几乎。就像美貌与敬畏耶和华，几乎不可能兼得。因为美貌的底层原理，就是血气的情欲。。。冲突的。。。















Summary 01 of the book of Christian theology:

Before we start to talk the concepts of theology, we need to know the history and original source of theology, the most important one is the definition of "belief" or "faith". 

Belief first means understanding the knowledge of what we believe in, second means rely on what we believe in. There are two Latin word to describe such difference: "Fides quae creditur" and "Fides qua creditur". To understand "belief" correctly, we shall combine those two ideas. 

The word of "belief" in the holy scripture contains the concept "relying on God", here we have Abraham the patriarch as a example, he was not just knowing the existence of God, but relying on God. The first step of "belief" is knowing the knowledge of God, and then we shall relying on God. 

In the process of "believing in God", the most important thing is the truth, the spirit of God, this make us believe in him, with our free will and our intelligence. Intelligence can only help us to know and believe in God with the leading of the spirit of God. 

There are many concepts related to our "belief", to study those concepts systematically, here is the word "theology". Theology is studying the resource, historical development, relationship and application of those concepts of "belief". Resource is the bases and foundation of theology, development is the change of those concepts in history, and application is the way to change our relationship, prayer, worship and lifestyle. 

The word "theology" comes from two Greek words, the word "θεος", which means "God", and the word "λογος", which means "word", thus the word "theology" means "the word of God", the one we worshiped. This word is not comes from the holy scripture, but was created in 2nd century, to identify the belief of Christian("theologia") from many other religions("mythologia"). 

There were many religions in the age of early church, thus to identify the belief of Christian, even the identification of the Lord, there are many theological concepts were discussed, one of them is the dogma of the trinity of God. When it was 12-13 century, many university started, they need a name to describe the study of "the belief of Christian", thus the word of "theology" was used by them to describe the dogma of the whole Christianity. Until now, the meaning of the word "theology" changed a lot, in fact, it means the study of religions with a committed viewpoint. 

Theology was taught mainly inside the church in the age of early church, to prepare the necessary knowledge of belief to teach, to preach and to advocate. But when it was 12 century, it becomes a main course of university, as an upper department to be studied by students. Thus the study of Christian belief opened to public, and from a practical knowledge became a theoretical knowledge. 

In the age of religious reforming, there were many reformer such as Martin Luther, they devoted themselves to move "theology" back to the practical area. From 1559, John Calvin concentrated on the theological education of pastors, thus theology became a knowledge related to Christian ministry in many seminaries and universities of reformed church. But after 18th century, theology is seemed as an outdated thing because it's not a rational analysis but based on the creeds or doctrines, from the church or the holy scripture. 

Theology contains the meditation of Bible, pursuit of wisdom, etiquette and prayer, work and labor, pastoral ideas, etc. Another one called "Evagrius Ponticus" described theology as prayer. Modern theology was constituted by the following parts: Biblical Theology, Systematical Theology, Philosophical theology, Historical Theology, Practical(Pastoral) Theology, Spiritual(Mystical) Theology, Apologia Theology. 

The ultimate source of Christian Theology is the holy scripture, which is the history of Israel and the life record of Jesus Christ. But in the 15th century, some researchers found some translated wrongs in Latin Bible, thus some doctrines based on the mistranslated Bible verses must be corrected. Until the religious reformation in the 16th century, the separation between theology and holy scripture ended, theology and holy scripture was combined again. 

Systematical theology is to describe the organized system of theology, first means to organize the core conceptions by the order of "Apostles Creed", second means the philosophical ideas of organizing resource to get knowledge. The order of the book "The Institutes of the the Christian Religion" written by John Calvin as below: the first is to talk about God; the second is to talk about the advocate, the one between God and humanity, Jesus Christ; the third is to talk about salvation; the last one is to talk about church life.  

Philosophical theology is to talk about the philosophy questions inside and outside of the church, to find out the common evidence and give a religious answer. But there are many ones disapprove this theology. 

Historical theology is to understand the base resource of Christian belief, to find out how the reason of region and environment affected theology. One purpose of historical theology is to apply Christian theology in all ages. As Emil Brunner said, there is everlasting gospel, but there is no everlasting theology. Theology application should be updated as the age(or region, environment) changed. 

Practical theology, or pastoral theology is to talk about pastor the church and practice theology. Theology should be used to pastor the church and to feed, to tend the spirits. 

Spiritual theology, or mystical theology is to talk about religious piety, it a personal inside experience. Apologia theology is to advocate the religion of Christianity in the world, to defend Christianity before attackers. 

There are so many areas of theology, and the word was used not only in Christianity but also in many other religions. As for me, I'm keen about historical theology rather than other areas. The source of the word "theology" gives me a new viewpoint to think about theology, it literally means "God's word", which indicates the holy scripture, and moreover, the incarnation of the word of God, Jesus Christ. 

It's my last semester in Kosin, I've studied many knowledge, and forgotten many knowledge too. There are many names I cannot remember, although I once impressed by their words. I'm not a good student in this perspective, but Jesus, in his word, those people in Jesus, still love me, and encourage me. Theology, a huge topic contains numberless concepts, incarnated as One Man, how a good news it is. Although I'm not a good theology student, may God put more love in my heart to love Jesus, ο Λογος του Θεου, Θεος, Λογος. His name, my Theology. 








确实，如果没有玛门来驱动这些人打印，翻译圣经及各种相关的资料，我们也不会这么轻易的能看到。该怎么理解呢？明明人是为了侍奉玛门，却成全了神的工作。就像，犹大卖耶稣，是的，卖神的话语，卖圣经，是图钱，但却成全了神的工作，把神的话语给予了更多的人。啊。。。Wed 08 Sep 2021 08:39:02 PM KST ，写基督教神学手册的总结，找英文资料，看到中文的翻译不足，有感。。。没有钱来驱动这些人干啊。我自己也不愿意，翻译这些干啥啊是不是。除非有益于生命，那是免费干也行的。就像彼得说，主有永生之道。为着这永生之道，那是可以免费干的，也必须免费干的。我可以学习，思考这永生之道，写救恩的历史，但不能再翻译，因为已经有了足够好的，想翻译个自己的版本的，这思想有点可怕。有些视频关于神的话语的，免费干也行的，永生的话语胜过一切。但谁能一直有呢。






开始划分时间，这是我管理的让他们住的我的生命里的块。嗯。只让耶稣住就好，但为何要有别的人呢？肉体不完全，也是不能完全，还能真割了吗？嗯。。。需要有个礼，到哪儿第一先是耶稣。

时间：
管理员睡觉时间，耶稣肯定不打扰我，就是其他的家伙：

虚拟机还在吗？看看圣经和赞美啊。。。拉取下来，圣经和赞美。
