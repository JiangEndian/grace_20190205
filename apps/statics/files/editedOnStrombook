summary: 

Natural theology is to get the knowledge of the Creator through the natural world, without any divine revelation. There are 6 approach methods: using only intelligence to talk about God; proving God by the order and complexity of nature; as a result of the humans' willingness of knowing God; searching the similar between the experience about nature and gospel; to prove the idea of atheism is wrong; and as the theology of nature. 

According to Thomas Aquinas, the original idea of natural theology is the doctrine of creation. Because God is the reason of all creatures so that the similarity with God exists in the order of creation. He use the principle of causality to prove his opinion: if A is the reason of B, and A has an attribute called Q, so B has the Q attribute too. 

Personally I can hardly agree with above principle, for example, set A as "-10", A*A=B, A as the reason of B, A has an attribute "Q" is "small than 0", but we cannot say B has the same attribute, B indeed greater than 0, because the result of A*A is 100. The principle is wrong, but the purpose is true: to prove God's attributes inside his creation. 

God's attributes indeed inside his creation, although there are just a little inside his creation. "Perfection" belongs to God only, and for his creatures, there are something inferior belong to then. 

According to John Calvin, we can get the common knowledge of God from the whole creature, but there are two basis here: religious semen as the subjective base, and the experience and observation about the world as the objective base. John Calvin thinks any one has the ability to come to the idea of God by observing the order of creation. 

John Calvin encourage science, because such knowledge with discover the wisdom of God the Creator. But he still pointed out the weakness of such knowledge: natural knowledge is not perfect and sometimes be contradict with itself, so it's not a suitable way to describe the characters of God perfectly. Thus he introduced the idea of revelation. 

In the age of Renaissance, the idea of "two books" attracted many people, the two books called "the book of nature", and "the book of Bible". The book of nature exposed the visible parts of God, the book of Bible revealed the deeper and richer knowledge of God, to lead us unto salvation.
