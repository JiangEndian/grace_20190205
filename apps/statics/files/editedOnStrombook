啊，主啊，求你拯救我们。我们这些可怜，弱小，无知的人。求你拯救我们。阿们。

Hello Dave. I'm sorry that I responded to you late, I'd like to share with you more things about China. 

In China, we have a culture called "避讳", which means you cannot have a name which our ruler has, even to pronounce it. As you know, this new Coronavirus called omicron, they skipped Mu and Xi, yes, that's for our president. 

Do you know WHY I don't like to talk about some political things with you? Because in China, we are forbidden to say anything bad about our government. I know you don't live in China, so you are not worried about that. 

In China, although they say they are atheist, they do believe, and they deified the ruler as god. When we thank God, they will say:"you shall thank CCP and the government. 

China is a big nation, sometimes I think it's similar to Rome. I think they have the same spirit. When we talk about China, we think we are talking about "one" nation, but in fact, China contains many "nations", which we call "provinces". 

We have a system called "户籍", which means the system to manager all people as their province. In fact, changing your information in this system, sometimes is more difficult than changing your nationality. 

When the huge gap between provinces occurred, I mean like those years, the conflict between them occurred too. They have a solution, that's giving a manager to a province from another province. Thus, we have peace inside until today, but the conflict between every province's people is terrible. 

About the rapture, I think Jesus will come again in ten years, and this is why I'm not afraid to live in China, because He will come soon. But I cannot command Him, coming or not, that's His decision. 

I'd love to live a life without money, but I know, even you, sometimes you must touch money. It's very hard to live without money in a world filled with money. 

The teaching of Jesus is written in the Bible, but all we know is how difficult it is to obey those teachings, unless we leave this body of flesh. I'm very happy for you to find some others to live a life as the commands of Jesus, but I know you cannot obey Him 100%, as a man of flesh, I know this point. However, 99% and 1% are the same in the eyes of God, that means "imperfect". 

We shall obey the commands of Jesus, although we cannot obey Him 100%, because no one is perfect. Matthew 5-48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. 

He is perfect, we shall be perfect. I do believe we shall obey the commands of Jesus although we cannot obey Him perfectly when we are in flesh. We cannot be perfect, but we shall be perfect. The former one is fact, the later one is truth. 

I understand your heart, to let all people to obey the commands of Jesus 100%, but your failure is obvious, because no one, even the prophet, cannot be perfect. 

“I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips,"

We are the same sinner, but you fear the Lord and tried to obey His commands. Although you are still the same with us, a sinner who cannot obey Him perfectly, you want to be perfect, you are trying to obey Him as you can. I want to be a man like you, knowing the failure, and try the best. 

We need Jesus, the one who cover our failure, to let us become perfect. He is the truth we are seeking. Amen.
