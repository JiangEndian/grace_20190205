Today is Wednesday, the class is professor Kim’s.

Before class, we worshiped the LORD, by voice, and most importantly, by our heart,  for God doesn’t see as man sees, for man looks at the outward, but Yahweh looks at the heart.

Our class started with one Hebrew verse, the book of Obadiah, chapter 1, verse 1, and our professor required us to memorize a part of this verse.
Obadiah 1-1 חֲזוֹן עֹבַדְיָה כֹּה־אָמַר אֲדֹנָי יְהוִה לֶאֱדוֹם
If we have the authority to disdain those illnesses, how can we respect those poor? If we dislike the bad smell of our brother, how can we welcome our Lord Jesus Christ who was born in a manger?

When our professor was asking us how many times the Hebrew word “day” occurred, I counted the word “day” in Chinese version, and replied with doubt, 8 times? Thus our professor said 8 times. Afterwards, I opened the original language parsing function for one verse which has one word of “day” in Chinese version, but in Hebrew version, the word “day” occurred 2 times. I was wrong. But it seems our professor doesn’t care about this too. So it’s not important for his class, but he just needs a student who is willing to communicate with him in his class.

Our professor gave us one more verse to memorize, the book of proverbs, chapter 16, verse 18, “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.”

My haughty sister started to be humble after she read the above-mentioned Bible verse, she is better than me, even though she started to be humble, how can I don’t. I shall be humble for my God is the most high one.

If he uses himself and money to attract others, how can he determine who loves him because of not money but himself? I give others gifts, and they like me, how can I know that he likes me or only my gift? Why doesn't God attract us by money? He let us like him because of himself, not others. I was thinking above written things when I was seeing that all of us students like our professor though he doesn’t bring food to us everyday.

He attracts us first by the tools of flesh, then he lets us know that we are not living on bread but his word. We are attracted to his word after we get to know his word. The word started with a sign, like a mother feeding her children at first, her children were attracted by her food, but afterwards, her children decided to love her not by her food but by herself, herself means her solidified history which was filled by her love, and support for her life.

The book of Jonah exemplifies the miraculous power and supremacy of God over his entire creation.

The severe winds and boisterous sea that God sent, then miraculously calmed.

The fish was guided to a place where Jonah was spewed out on dry land.

A worm was prepared to wither the plant.

A vehement east wind was prepared by God.

God’s servants obey Him even when the circumstances are contrary to their expectations and hopes.

The Bible mentions imperfections in other renowned individuals.

God’s willingness to forgive upon heartfelt repentance is striking and an encouragement to those who seek to please their Creator but at times succumb to human weaknesses.

The young evangelist Timothy was admonished by the apostle Paul.







Today is Tuesday, the class is professor Yu’s. 
Before we started our class, I thanked our brother for his delicious food, for I just mentioned once, and he prepared a bag of that food for me. 
I took out my iPad today and contacted my mom, she said about her delay payment, that she shouldn’t care about money, if she pays attention to money, she can’t live her life. Thus she didn’t keep her eyes open to money, and concentrate on the life which God gave her. She believes in God, not God’s money. Such as, I believe in the promises of God and God’s image, but not the promised things. But the delay fulfillment of promises is common, to see our heart is adhering to money or God. We shouldn’t pay attention to money more than God, but pay attention to God and ignore the money, believe in God even without money. So, I can’t follow that pastor, because he has no word of eternal life, if he has, I can follow him without any money promise, but because he has no word of eternal life, although he promises money or gives me money on the spot, I can hardly follow him. 
The main features of Gospel, first is prophetic promises of Jesus Christ, second is the kingdom of God, Jesus Christ’s person and work, third is the cross and resurrection. 
We have a mystical union with Christ in death and resurrection. 
Deification through Christ, we received righteousness by his resurrection. Deification means the condition of being treated like a god. an embodiment of the qualities of a god the capitalists' deification of capital. the elevation of a person (as to the status of a god). 
God raised Jesus from the dead, he is the true and only Messiah, the Father and the Spirit testify that he is the Messiah. 
The death of death in the death and resurrection of Christ. 
Three methods to get to know the attributes of God, first is the negative method, such as God is not human, God is not evil. Second is the Eminence method, such as God is our Father. Third is causality method, God created the world so God is created, God saved us so God is our savior. 
The communicable attributes means such attributes belong to God and also humans. The incommunicable attributes of God means those attributes just belong to God. But someone said all attributes are communicable and also incommunicable, like our brother had said. We are the image of God, but we are not God, we have those attributes inside to a certain extent. 
Some incommunicable attributes, such as Spirituality, Simplicity, Eternity, Immutability, Omnipresence, Omniscience. Immutability means The state or quality of being immutable; immutableness. The state of being unchangeable in the memory after creation. Omnipresence means The ability to be at all places at the same time; usually only attributed to God. Omniscience means the state of being omniscient; having infinite knowledge. 
The delay fulfillment may be a better fulfillment, such as the thanks I don’t give my brother who brings food to me in messenger, but I thanked him late in class before all the students . 
I admired my leader with my sisters, he knows almost everything we are about to learn. Most importantly, he serves us like our servant, so he is our leader according to the word of our Lord Christ Jesus. 
Communicable attributes include knowledge, wisdom, good, spirituality, love, holy, righteousness, truthfulness, sovereignty. 
God’s name means his attributes, his essence and his being. You shall not take the name of Yahweh you or God in vain, thus Jews even don’t dare to read the name of God in Holy Scripture, instead of the pronunciation of God’s name, they pronounced his name as Adonai. 
There is good, and absolute goodness means God, there is holy, and absolute holiness means God. There are many attributes of God, but these are one attribute, because our God is One. 
Almost all languages connected heaven with the conception of God. The name of God is plural, but he is one, so this form of plural is called majesty plural. 
The name of God is too holy to be pronounced, so they don’t pronounce this name and even don’t write down this name just leave a blank, or use the word LORD, all alphabet of this word is capitalization. This name has a term called Tetragrammaton. 
God said that “I AM who I AM”, he decided his name, his name was expressed in his action, he is absolute one, he reveals himself in his name. His name is revelation of love, a covenant, a redemptive history. 
Our God is a king of majesty and glory. His majesty in his power, his absolute. His glory means his essence, his salvation, and his ethics. He expresses these by redemption. 
God’s name was expressed a lot in Isaiah 43:1-13. 
I asked my mom about her bank account, because she didn’t get any money after she came to South Korea, whether her salary or the reimbursement of travel and quarantine expenses. But I got 900,000 won this month. 
God said that “The people called by my name”, means us christian, in Isaiah 43:7. 







Some denominations of protestantism, Anglican of England, Calvinists, Anabaptists, Congregationalists, Lutheran, Episcopal of America, Methodists. 

Anglicanism is a tradition within Christianity comprising the Church of England and churches which are historically tied to it or hold similar beliefs, worship practices and church structures. The word Anglican originates in ecclesia anglicana, a medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the English Church. Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans. The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion. There are, however, a number of churches that are not within the Anglican Communion which also consider themselves to be Anglican, most notably those referred to as Continuing Anglicanchurches, and those which are part of the Anglican realignment movement.

Calvinism (also called the Reformed tradition, Reformed Christianity, Reformed Protestantism or the Reformed faith) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice of John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians.

Anabaptism (from Neo-Latin anabaptista, from the Greek ἀναβαπτισμός: ἀνά- "re-" and βαπτισμός "baptism") is a Christianmovement which traces its origins to the Radical Reformation. Some consider this movement to be an offshoot of Protestantism, while others see it as distinct.

Congregational churches are ProtestantChristian churches practicing congregationalist church governance, in which each congregation independently and autonomously runs its own affairs. Congregationalism is often considered to be a part of the wider Reformed tradition.


Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity which identifies with the theology of Martin Luther (1483-1546) — a German friar, ecclesiasticalreformer and theologian.

Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the Catholic Churchlaunched the Protestant Reformation in the German-speaking territories of the Holy Roman Empire. Beginning with the Ninety-Five Theses, first published in 1517, Luther's writings were disseminated internationally, spreading the early ideas of the Reformation beyond the influence and control of the Roman Curia and the Holy Roman Emperor. The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms: The edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas, subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property, half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation. The divide centered primarily on two points: the proper source of authority in the church, often called the formal principle of the Reformation, and the doctrine of justification, often called the material principle.



An episcopal church has bishops in its organisational structure which is called Episcopal polity.



Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianitywhich derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary activity, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States, and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide.



TULIP, the five main ideas of Calvinism, Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace, Perseverance of the Saints. 

Supralapsarianism, The logical order of God's decrees in Calvinist theology is the study of the logical order (in God's mind, before Creation) of the decree to ordain or allow the fall of man and reprobation in relation to his decree to elect and save sinners. Several opposing positions have been proposed, all of which have names with the Latin root  lapsus meaning fall.

The Lord told Jonah to go to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, about 550 miles northeast of Israel. Instead, Jonah boarded a ship bound for Tarshish, a destination that may have been as far as 2,500 miles in the opposite direction. 

Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodoxy, The Eastern Orthodox Church, officially the Orthodox Catholic Church, also referred to as the Orthodox Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Orthodoxy, is the second largest Christian Church in the world, with an estimated 225–300 million adherents.
The Eastern Orthodox Church is one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, teaching that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission to the apostles, and practicing what it understands to be the original faith passed down from the Apostles.

Because of her morning prayer, she has no time to turn her heart to idols who are not the One. Today is Thursday, and I started today by worship and Bible, my mother started today by morning prayer, both of us have no time to worship the idols who are not the One. Only if we worship the only One God, can we have the ability to live with God’s image. 

Apologetics (from Greekἀπολογία, "speaking in defense") is the discipline of defending a position (often religious) through the systematic use of information. Early Christian writers (c. 120–220) who defended their faith against critics and recommended their faith to outsiders were called apologists.

Arminianism is based on theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609) and his historic supporters known as the Remonstrants. His teachings held to the five solae of the Reformation, but they were distinct in some ways from particular teachings of Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers. Jacobus Arminius (Jakob Harmenszoon) was a student of Theodore Beza (Calvin's successor) at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a soteriological diversification of ProtestantCalvinist Christianity. However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.

The Puritans were a group of EnglishReformed Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who sought to "purify" the Church of England from all Roman Catholic practices, maintaining that the Church of England was only partially reformed. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some of the returning clergy exiled under Mary I shortly after the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558 as an activist movement within the Church of England.

Westminster (/ˈwɛsᵗmɪnstər/) is an area of central London within the City of Westminster on the north bank of the River Thames. Westminster's concentration of visitor attractions and historic landmarks, one of the highest in London, includes the Palace of Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Westminster Cathedral.

Pietism (/ˈpaɪᵻtɪsm/, from the word piety) was an influential movement within Lutheranism that combined 17th-century Lutheran principles with the Reformed emphasis on individual piety and living a vigorous Christian life.

It began in the late 17th century, reached its zenith in the mid-18th century, and declined through the 19th century, and had almost vanished in America by the end of the 20th century. While declining as an identifiable Lutheran group, some of its theological tenets influenced Protestantism generally, inspiring the Anglican priest John Wesley to begin the Methodist movement and Alexander Mackto begin the Brethren movement among Anabaptists.

 A Christian revival, or revivalism, is increased spiritual interest or renewal in the life of a church congregation or society, with a local, national or global effect. This should be distinguished from the use of the term "revival" to refer to an evangelistic meeting or series of meetings (see Revival meeting).

Pentecostalism or Classical Pentecostalism is a renewal movement within Protestant Christianity that places special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit. The term Pentecostalis derived from Pentecost, the Greek name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ, as described in the second chapter of the Book of Acts.

Evangelicalism, Evangelical Christianity, or Evangelical Protestantism is a worldwide, transdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity maintaining that the essence of the gospel consists in the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ's atonement. Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or "born again" experience in receiving salvation, in the authority of the Bible as God's revelation to humanity, and spreading the Christian message.

Liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality. Whereas classical liberalism emphasizes the role of liberty, social liberalism stresses the importance of equality. Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but generally they support ideas and programs such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free markets, civil rights, democratic societies, secular governments, and international cooperation.

Fundamentalism usually has a religious connotation that indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs. However, fundamentalism has come to apply to a tendency among certain groups—mainly, though not exclusively, in religion—that is characterized by a markedly strict literalism as applied to certain specific scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, and a strong sense of the importance of maintaining ingroup and outgroup. distinctions, leading to an emphasis on purity and the desire to return to a previous ideal from which advocates believe members have strayed. Rejection of diversity of opinion as applied to these established "fundamentals" and their accepted interpretation within the group is often the result of this tendency. 
 
Evil is the absence of Good, said Augustine of Hippo. 

Pelagius (circa 360 – 418) was a British-born ascetic moralist, who became well known throughout ancient Rome. He opposed the idea of predestination and asserted a strong version of the doctrine of free will. He was accused by Augustine of Hippo and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing good works. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of original sin. His adherents cited Deuteronomy 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a heretic by the Council of Carthage. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as Pelagianism. St. Augustine opposed this philosophy. 

Monergism is the position in Christian theology that God, through the Holy Spirit, works to bring about the salvation of an individual through spiritual regeneration, irrespective of the individual's cooperation. Monergism is most often associated with Calvinism(such as Presbyterianism and the Dutch Reformed Church) and its doctrine of irresistible grace, and particularly with historical doctrinal differences between Calvinism and Arminianism.

Synergism is The theological doctrine that salvation is brought about by a combination of human will and divine grace. 

In theology, synergism is the position of those who hold that salvation involves some form of cooperation between divine grace and human freedom. It stands opposed to monergism, a doctrine most commonly associated with the Lutheran and Reformed Protestant traditions, whose soteriologies have been strongly influenced by the North African bishop and Latin Church Father Augustine of Hippo (354–430). Synergism is upheld by the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, and by the Methodist and Pentecostal traditions of Protestantism. It is an integral part of Arminian theology.

Prevenient grace is a Christian theological concept rooted in Arminian theology, though it appeared earlier in Catholic theology. It is divine grace that precedes human decision. It exists prior to and without reference to anything humans may have done. As humans are corrupted by the effects of sin, prevenient grace allows persons to engage their God-given free will to choose the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ or to reject that salvific offer.

Divine grace is a theological term present in many religions. It has been defined as the divine influence which operates in humans to regenerate and sanctify, to inspire virtuous impulses, and to impart strength to endure trial and resist temptation; and as an individual virtue or excellence of divine origin.








Our Systematic Theology professor said he will come to our class late due to the presbytery. And he explained to us what is presbytery by English. He tell us this noun by Korean first, than repeated it by English. 

Here are some explains in Dictionary. Presbytery is a body of Church elders and ministers, especially in Presbyterian Churches, an administrative body representing all the local congregations of a district
