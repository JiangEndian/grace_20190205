Today is Friday, the class is professor Chon’s. Our professor came a little late, so I contacted my mom before the class start, I want to go to the place where my mom lives, and she replied me a little late, so I worried about this a while.

When we were waiting our professor, my mom replied me and let me go to her place, I said nothing but YES, I will go. My mom asked me whether I have enough money to see her, and I tell her that I have money to go. When we were talking, our professor came into our class room, to avoid strange face expression, I said to mom to have a video talking after our class finished.

Holy spirit is called cleaning spirit, who is cleaning our spirit.

The word of the Lord can remove weeds of our heart land. We need to repent and remember the word of God in our heart.

But we don’t like to receive the word of God because of our evil things in heart, which will be attacked by the word of God, and let our heart become a battlefield, which make us suffering. However our Father is our King, he must rule over our heart, he will kill all enemies in our heart. He reigns forever and ever, he is our King our Father.

The changing of our heart will lead us to new life.

Some of us tug at the rules so hard that we never soar to reach the heights we might have obtained. It’s not our willing, like the walls of the kingdom of heaven is not built by us, that the grace of God, we live in there not by ourselves but by the irresistible power of God. Moreover, we are willing to live there, it’s limited, but we live in the light of God freely. Thank you for you kept us by your irresistible rules when we are deceived to destroy ourselves. Thank you, tug at the rules, to give me freedom in your limitation. The limitation of your kingdom of heaven is my keeper, keep me live safely in your home.

Sacred and Secular, the theory of Augustine.

I want to go to toilet, to get happy from my body pressure, however it’s not the time for my body happy, but it’s the time for the class. God will give me the time for toilet, for he is mercy, even to a cattle.

God’s Sovereignty and God’s Glory are two important points that we shall remember.

The Christian View of God and the World, is the book of James Orr.

Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should meet Jesus Christ tomorrow.





The contradiction between God and his agent, first is that there are contradictions between them, second is that although there are contradictions between them we shall respect God’s agents as God, God’s agents only be judged by God, third is two attitudes to face God’s agents, obey like the widow, or escape like David.

We discussed above mentioned questions from the problem of  offering gifts to God in the Sunday morning, March 28, 2021, I cited the window who obeyed God’s agents and offered her all money, the King David who escaped from God’s agents who wanted to kill him, the son of Samuel who were rejected by Israelites, however God thinks not his agents but himself was rejected by Israelites.

After that I fetch out all of my money from my purse, all of them are small money, maybe all of them can become a big money, and said “I will give out all of I have, obeyed the agent’s of God.” Then my mom said, “Who covet your small money?” I replied, “The money of the widow were just two very small brass coins, who covet her money? But Jesus said those scribes devour widow’s houses. Are they robbers? No, they are agents of God, the scribes, the leaders of religion.” And I count those small money in the offering envelope just now, and I found that it is exactly one big money.

How can those scribes devour the widow’s houses? By which way they can devour the widow’s houses? From the context we can only find that the widow offered all that she  had to live on. God devoured her house? Jesus admired her because of her offering, and who will receive those offering? Not Jesus, and Jesus rebuked those scribes, said they devour widows’ houses. The widow be taught by the agent’s of God, and offered all of she has to God, but must thorough the agent’s of God, God admired the widow, but rebuked his agents. There are contradictions between God and his agents, from the old Testament until the new Testament, and there is no one can be a perfect agent of God, so God gave us his only one Son, only on him can we rely.








Today is Tuesday, our professor came late, and before class my sister asked me about Hebrew participle, I found the summery of our Hebrew class, and show her the summery and try to interpret about participle, then our professor came into our class room, we have not finish our interpretation yet. However God is good. 

The five blessing of Abraham, Nation, Name, Land, Relation, and Blessing. 

God’s names are revelation. Accommodation of God, God in the form of human, the word is “Anthropomorphism.” 

The description of God including the aspects of human, such as body, emotion, actions, professions, and some things, such as some animals, and stone. 

We call God our Father, but the word “Father” can’t describe the whole God, we can use many things to describe God, but there is no one can describe the whole God, this is the difference of God and his creation. Thus, the thesis of “Anthropomorphism” has it’s limitation. 

Pantheism said God is the world, but Bible said that God surpass the whole world. 

The four points of Glory, first is essence, “glory” in Hebrew means heavy; second is radiant; third is salvation, all of his creation express his glory, but they were crusted because of sins, and salvation is the way to glorify God;  fourth is imitation, we are the image of God, if we imitate God, we glorify God. 

I shouldn’t ask that “Do we have meat” because of there is a verse said about such people as a bad friend to associate with. Proverbs 23-20 Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge themselves on meat. 

Gorge means overeat or eat immodestly; make a pig of oneself. Immodestly means not modest. Modest means having a humble opinion of yourself. 

Ectypal theology, first means our knowledge of God comes from God; second means God’s accommodation; third means similitude, similitude means similarity in appearance or character or nature between persons or things; fourth means believable of God, God let person become believer. 

Divine repentance, is the repentance of God, different with the repentance of human. 

The names of God express his essence and attributes. 

Divine simplicity, means God’s being, God’s essence, God’s attributes, are same, because God is Spirit. 

The professor is saying the story of “blind touch elephant,” and this makes me think of the first year of my Kosin life, I said same thing, but they disdained me. Maybe they don’t agree with professor, like don’t agree with me, but because of his status or position, they can’t disdain him but just listen or agree with. Maybe they agreed with me in 2019 when I was saying the same thing, but they must disdain me, because of my status and position. We don’t disdain things or words, but disdain the one who said it or made it. Things can’t receive any disdain. 

When Israelites were rejecting the sons of Samuel, God thinks they rejected him. Disdaining someone’s words or things, it’s not disdaining the words or things, but the one. 

Israel is the nation of God, Israelites are the people of God, and especially, those who rejected the sons of Samuel are the elders of Israel. The conclusion is: “If someone disdain me, it’s disdaining me, if someone doesn’t disdain me, he is surpass over me, he has such qualification to disdain me.” 






Hebrews 1-11 They will perish, but you continue. They all will grow old like a garment does.

Today is Wednesday,  the class is professor Kim’s, when I was watching our professor, I think of a word, “The warrior killed the dragon and became the new dragon”. And then I think of above one verse, we are new religion, but we grown old now. Not only religion, but everything, even the whole world, they all will grow old like a garment does. But our Lord will continue forever and ever. 

The impending judgment in the book of Amos,  and the synthetic chart of Amos. 

Prosecution of the nations. The prosecutor is the chief legal representative of the prosecution in countries with either the common lawadversarial system, or the civil lawinquisitorial system. The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case in a criminal trial against an individual accused of breaking the law.

Three judgment speeches and two woe Oracles. Woe means misery resulting from affliction. Oracle means an authoritative person who divines the future, a prophecy, usually obscure or allegorical, revealed by a priest or priestess; believed to be infallible. 

Amos 3-3 Do two walk together, unless they have agreed? The Chinese version of this verse is “They can’t walk together, unless they have same heart”. 

Amos 3-7 Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing, unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets. This verse reminds me the way of God’s working. The agent of God has more meanings for me than before. 

Three message of accusation and judgement. A clean conscience fears not false accusations.

Amos 6-5 who strum on the strings of a harp; who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David; I should watch my heart carefully, although there are instruments like David’s, but the heart of David different with them. 

Vision of Plumb Line, Plumb means to measure the depth of something, as a noun means the metal bob of a plumb line. Bob means the former monetary unit in Great Britain. 

Not suppression but Freedom, Not Scapegoating but Responsibility, Not Ignoring but Advocacy, Not Stinginess but Generosity. 

Amos 7-3 Yahweh relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” says Yahweh. The repentance of God means he is mercy and don’t give us the disasters what we deserve. 

Amos 5-4 For Yahweh says to the house of Israel: “Seek me, and you will live; Amos 5-24 But let justice roll on like rivers, and righteousness like a mighty stream. The Key Verses of Amos. 

Leviticus 16-8 Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats; one lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for the scapegoat. 

The word responsibility start with the word response, someone response quickly has a strong responsibility, says our professor. 

Our professor asked me a Hebrew word, and I answered it, then I got to be pride, I’m so small, so light, than I can’t bear any glory now. Thank God not giving me any glory, because I can’t bear it, but maybe hurt by it. Until I have the life of elder, who knows to give glory to God. 

Our professor asked me another Hebrew word, and I don’t know it, thank God let me know how ignorance is me. Only God gives me some knowledge, can I have some knowledge. Gloria in excelsis Deo. 

In 1517, the religion reformation started from Luther. 

Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. 

What religious denomination does he belong to?

Quaker means a member of the Religious Society of Friends founded by George Fox, the Friends have never called themselves Quakers. Or means one who quakes and trembles with fear. Earthquake, the earth is quaking.
