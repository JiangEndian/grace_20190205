Today is Friday, the class is professor Chon’s. 

If you use elders’ language to preach, because they use the same words to say somethings in a restricted frame, but as for you younger, you need to use different language. If you don’t know the high level language, it’s difficult to preach to young students. 

In ancient times, spirits entered humans directly. But nowadays, spirit enters humans rarely, especially in metropolitan cities, because spirits know the change of age, and changed their behavior, our professor says, they masqueraded themselves as angels of light, attractive ones, such as culture movement, those new and attractive ones. We should hide ourselves from the modern culture, because it’s dangerous if we expose ourselves to the modern culture. 

There is even no television in our professor’s home. Television is not bad, because it’s the gift such as art God gives us, to let us enjoy his creation. The beautiful creations are not evil things, we need to discover those beautiful things, those attractive things are real angels of light, the good will of God. We need to enjoy those beautiful things and good thoughts of the One Good God. We should pray for the ability to distinguish those angels of light, because such of them are real servants of the only One Good God, but another one is the evil one Satan who masqueraded himself as an angel of light. 

Prayer (from the Latin precari "to ask earnestly, beg, entreat") is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication.

Prayer can be a form of religious practice, may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private. It may involve the use of words, song or complete silence. When language is used, prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person. There are different forms of prayer such as petitionary prayer, prayers of supplication, thanksgiving, and praise. Prayer may be directed towards a deity, spirit, deceased person, or lofty idea, for the purpose of worshiping, requesting guidance, requesting assistance, confessing transgressions (sins) or to express one's thoughts and emotions. Thus, people pray for many reasons such as personal benefit, asking for  divine grace, spiritual connection, or for the sake of others.



There is not one piece of cosmic dust that is outside the scope of God’s sovereign providence, said R. C. Sproul. 



Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God. 



There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry: ‘Mine’!” Said Abraham Kuyper. 



Soli Deo Gloria, means glory only to God. 



Those who were praised in this world, had nothing in heavenly kingdom. Calvin practiced this wholeheartedly, there is even no one monument for him. He is very careful to avoid being praised by humans. One principle of our professor when he was President of Kosin University was “avoiding to show his photo to others”. 



Three principles of SFC, first is God-centered, second is Bible-centered, third is Church-centered. 



Hedonism is a school of thought that argues that pleasure is the primary or most important intrinsic good. A hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure (pleasure minus pain).

Ethical hedonism is the idea that all people have the right to do everything in their power to achieve the greatest amount of pleasure possible to them. It is also the idea that every person's pleasure should far surpass their amount of pain. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.



If we eat well, the flesh will be well developed and our spirit will be weak, so they reduce their food and fast frequently. Our professor said about Hedonism and those monks. And if we seek alcohol and money, then we will seek sex and drugs, our professor said about those things what can make us happy in the age of Hedonism. They earn money to enjoy more, but after they earn more money, their lust is expanded too, so just having a little money is the grace of God, said our professor. The main factor of the people who live on this island don’t follow hedonism is that they have no money. 



Ontological Nihilism. 



Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist, and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering.



Nihilism (/ˈnaɪ.ᵻlɪzəm/or /ˈniː.ᵻlɪzəm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not inherently exist, and that any established moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism can also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or that reality does not actually exist.



Epistemology (/ᵻˌpɪstᵻˈmɒlədʒi/; fromGreekἐπιστήμη, epistēmē, meaning "knowledge, understanding",andλόγος, logos, meaning "word") is a word first used by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier to describe the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. It examines the nature of knowledge and how one can acquire it. Much of the debate in this field has focused on the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth, belief, and justification.



Epistemological Nihilism. 





The love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned

Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing



1 Samuel 2-30 “Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me will be lightly esteemed.

For a man who respects me, how can I disdain him? For a man who disdains me, I should respect him still, because I am a man, maybe there are some faults in me. Today is Friday, I’m in the church of pastor shim now, and I went to see the pastor first, then went to the place where my mom lived. When I was eating my dinner, an elder came out from one room, and I stood up to bow to him to show my respect towards him. No one can disdain a man who respects him, because that disdains the respect of himself, unless he disdains himself and sees himself does not deserve respect, he cannot disdain a man who expresses respect to him. Remember the reaction of God when he faces man, and be careful that humans are the image of God.

There is one more reason that I should go to see the pastor before my mother, that’s the logic of the rainbow. When I see the rainbow in heaven, I shall not think about the rainbow, but the maker of heaven and earth, the covenant of the Lord, the mercy of God, the salivation of our Savior. Going to see my mother is the same thing as the above one thing of seeing the rainbow. I go to see my mother, and my mother can’t be the objective of our spirit, but the Only One God, I go to see my mother, and I shall think about the merciful God who gives me my mother. To express my respect to God my Father, I shall go to see the agent of my Father first, then go to see my mother and be glad of her and have a thankful heart of God, thus express thanks to his grace, to express that I’m very happy because of the grace of my Father, he’s so mercy to me.






I will describe your good deeds before my Father. April 25, 2021, before I go to church to worship, I met a sister who gave me many biscuit in winter vacation when I was getting water, coincidentally the Missionary of my Father besides me, so I mentioned the sister to the Missionary of my Father about her good deeds towards me in winter vacation. 

Jesus is also revered outside of Christianity. In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets and the messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was born of a virgin, but was neither God nor a begotten God. The Quran states that Jesus never claimed divinity. Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified, but that he was physically raised into Heaven by God. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected.





Today is Tuesday, the class is professor Yu’s. 

Some components of a thriving friendship are honesty, naturalness, thoughtfulness, some common interests. 

Westminster Assembly talked about Westminster confession, Westminster Larger Catechism, Westminster shorter Catechism, Psalms, Directory of Public Worship, Disciplines. They decided to start this assembly and asked help from those nobilities. The subject first is the Reformation of Doctrines, Second is the Reformation of Worship, and third is the Life. 

Middle Ages Theology talked about existence, definition, character and classification. Such as Justification: Justification exists or not? How to definite Justification? What’s the character of Justification? How to classify Justification? This method was called scholastic method. 

The philosophy of humanism is the position of human, human centered, human is supreme over animals. 

The first dream of Calvin is to become a Christian Humanist, and wrote a book called “Tolerance” about his points of view. Then he wrote his famous book, “The Institutes of the Christian Religion”. 

The different viewpoints about Reward between Catholic and Protestant, all of those admit that there is Reward, but Catholic thinks that’s merit, because of human’s works, on the contrary, Protestant thinks that’s grace, because of human’s faithful heart. Like a father gives his son money, and then his son buys some gift for him, he admires his son, because he is rich in charity and mercy. 

Don’t pray anymore, if you pray constantly, we will have no professor to teach us. Said our brother Zheyu, about our sister Yanyan, and we laughed together, that made our professor become curious about our topic, and thus I translated the word of our brother for our professor by Korean. But it seems I don’t care about my sister's feelings, as she didn’t care about my feelings. I shall approach those men who have noble souls. 

The Glory of God means the essential of God, the radiant existence of God, the Redemption of God, the Imitation of God. 

The form, measure and order of God’s goodness. The existence of humans is meaningful, no matter how good or bad that man is. Although it’s bad, the creature’s existence itself is good, for the one who created it is good. All creatures fulfill the purpose of his creator, that’s the blessing of God, the gift of God. 

All of us exist because of others, but God exists just because of himself. Jesus didn’t entrust himself to those followers, Jesus knew everyone, Jesus exists because of himself. He saves us just because he wants to save us, there are no reasons, just because of himself. But God loves us so much that he asks love from us, it seems if we don’t love him, he will lose something precious. All of these just because he loves us. 

Humans can live without the love of parents or others, it seems humans can live without others, but we can’t live without God. If we lose our hands, still we can live, but how about the hands? If we lose our head, our whole body will die, and the head lives alone. We are the body of Jesus Christ, he is our head. Without us he will still live like the former days without us, but he loves us, thus he can’t lose us, just because he loves us. 

Humans are worship creatures. 

One Essence, Latin version is “una essentia“, Greek version is “mia ousia”. Three Persons, Latin version is “tres personae”, Greek version is “treis hypostaseis”. The three persons of one Essence have the same substance, the same power, the same eternity. They are One in Charity. Charity expressed in the motion for unity. 

Father’s personhood, not born. Son’s personhood: eternal generation. Spirit’s personhood: eternal procession. To understand the word “born” and “procession”, we can think about “intellect” and “will”, “word” and “love”. 

Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and lawand is closely tied with legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to law, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.





Today is Wednesday, the class is professor Kim’s. 

When our professor said “Love your neighbor as yourself” after we sang a song, my sister said to me, “Buy lunch for me!” But I respond, “You love me and you let me buy food for you? What’s this love?” Maybe she didn’t love me, but just wanted others to love her. However, God makes me no money, I have no money for even a lunch, Hallelujah. God saved me by his measureless wisdom and foresight. 

Micah shows that a true relationship with God is inextricably linked to how we treat one another. 

God’s indictment. 

Authentic spirituality. 

Micah contrasts Judah’s sinful kingdom with God’s righteous and just messianic kingdom. 

He has shown you, O man, what is good.  What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly,  to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?  Our professor let us remember this verse of Micah 6:8, the key verse of Micah. 

If we follow the footsteps of Jesus who bear his cross, we needn’t say anything but follow him. However, in churches of this age, we said many things, but didn't follow Jesus after we left church. Said our professor. 

The restoration of God’s people in the millennial kingdom. 

Judgement and restoration inspire fear and hope, two ideas wrapped up in the final sequence of Micah’s prophecy, a courtroom scene in which God’s people stand trial before their Creator for turning away from Him and from others. 

The fear and sting of judgment. 

My brothers admired me for my explanation of one Hebrew verse, and I replied that I just stepped one more step than them and they will soon catch up with me, and eventually we will arrived at the same place, some of us are quick, some of us are slow, but all of us will arrived at the same stage. Before our God. All of us belong to him, we live on his grace, we are his grace. 

Destruction Decreed. 

Verdict of Vengeance. Vindication of Vengeance. 

Batting vs. Judah’s Splendor. 

Destruction and Despoiling. 

Destruction for Cruelty. 

The walls were surrounded by a moat 150 feet wide and 60 feet deep. 

It is believed that Nineveh could withstand a 20-year siege. 

Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good tidings, who proclaims peace. 

The gospel was an integral part of the message Christ preached. 

What you sow you shall reap. 

God will not allow rampant and unrestrained wickedness to prosper and increase indefinitely. 

Mayflies or shadflies are aquatic insects belonging to the order Ephemeroptera. This order is part of an ancient group of insects termed the Palaeoptera, which also contains dragonflies and damselflies. Over 3,000 species of mayfly are known worldwide, grouped into over 400 genera in 42 families. 

In a sense Nineveh’s doom epitomizes the fate of all nations. Military might does not preclude obligations of righteousness and justice. 

The crumbling rubble of the arrogant city is a grim reminder that only those nations who rely on the God who is the source of true peace will see “on the mountains the feet of him who brings good tidings, who proclaims peace”. 

Through the prophet Isaiah God speaks to mankind with pleading and supplication. 

The Lord is slow to anger and great in power, but He will surely not acquit, the Lord-His way is with a tempest and with a storm, and cloud is the dust of His feet. 

The world carnal temporal. 

It would be better to add your personal impression and some critique,

God the creator, is omnipotent and all good. 

Evil is a privation or lack of goodness in something. 

Hierarchy of beings, God, realm of Angels, human world, natural world. 

Disharmony in the world follows the fall of Angels leading to natural evil. 

Free will is valuable so God sustains a world within which moral and natural evil occurs. 





Today is Friday, the class is professor Chon’s. 

Our professor started his class with an issue about a woman who struck a server in a shop, and said that woman was Chinese, but he still stressed that there are also many bad Korean, it’s not a problem of Nation, but a problem of individuals. Moreover our professor mentioned some misbehavior he had done. Our professor is an open minded man, his viewpoints considering many aspects. 

Epistemological Nihilism, There is no truth, in the Platonic sense, and our “greatest truths are only errors that we cannot give up.” 

Perspectivism, all of our knowledge is gleaned through one, or another, perspective, point of view. 

There is no “objective truth”, there is no unbiased point of view. 

Ideally, we should try to appreciate as many perspectives as possible. 

Ontological Nihilism, if there is no god, our existence is meaningless and because of evolution or by chance. Ontological nihilism is totes bae. 

In those days there was no king, everyone did what is right in his own eyes. This verse of Judges said about perspective, there is nothing right in all eyes, but they did what is right in his own eyes. 

The information from a Bible Application on my Android phone: Because those application stories have removed Bible Application, and the way of downloading Bible Application is narrowing, we edited the function of sharing urgently, to allow you share this application face to face. I think that we are back to the age of face to face. Although we have the internet in this age, face to face is still the best way for us christian. 

Eros is the Desire of Love, Thanatos is the Desire of Death. First one is about Sex, Second one is about Death. OH... We have no other desires? The desire of charity, the desire of agape, the desire of serving, the desire of heavenly kingdom, the desire of the word of God, the desire of Jesus. 

Etching is traditionally the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio (incised) in the metal. In modern manufacturing, other chemicals may be used on other types of material. As a method of printmaking, it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for old master prints, and remains in wide use today. In a number of modern variants such as microfabrication etching and photochemical milling it is a crucial technique in much modern technology, including circuit boards. 

You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people’s feet. Matthew 5:13. 





Today is Friday, the class is professor Chon’s.

Before class, my sister asked me about her hair, she cut her hair by herself, and asked my opinion about her hair, I replied that her hair is shorter than before, and “that’s very beautiful from behind, so don’t turn your face around”, I said to my sister.

Sacred, things pertaining to the spiritual, eternal, and unchanging upper realm of God in heaven.

Secular, things pertaining to the physical, temporal, and changing lower realm of humans on earth.

Church is Dualistic Spirituality, God, Church, World, One part of Church belongs to God, the sacred realm, and another one part of Church belongs to the World, the secular realm. Church is the mediating institution.

In the common boundary of God and Church, there are Sacred activities, such as worship, prayer, etc. God’s interaction with his people occurs there.

In the common boundary of Church and World, there are Secular activities, such as work, play, politics. The individual’s and the Church’s interaction with the world occurs here. And the mission and evangelism occurs here.

We should use and develop our talents which God gives us, our professor said, and mentioned about my English version summary, said that although it’s difficult to write by English at first, after you use it more, practice it more, and develop it more, you will get more English skills and knowledge. The conclusion is that “we shall use and develop the talents which God gives us.”

The Integration of Faith and Learning. Worship is a lifestyle.

Jesus Abbey. An abbey located in South Korea, influenced Korean a lot, affected South Korea a lot.

The motto of the school of life’s river: To work is to pray, To pray is to work. The original motto is “pray and work”, but afterwards, the motto changed, and they have the same meaning, our professor said.

Every activity can be transformed into an act of Worship.

Worship is a lifestyle, what you do throughout the day is your act of worship to God.

Even if your body isn’t healthy, your soul overcomes that, it doesn’t even care, it worships anyway, it's joyful anyway. That’s what God wants to give you in your life.

If the man who was robbed by robbers was met by those scribes before temple, they will save him, our professor said, because that event will be seen by others, so they will do, but in a desert, there are no one could see their good deeds, so they don’t care about the man who was robbed by robbers. They are living before man, but we shall live before the face of God, like our motto, Coram Deo, before the face of God.

Every occupation has its own honor before God. Ordinary work is a divine vocation or calling. In our daily work no matter how important or mundane we serve God by serving the neighbor and we also participate in God’s on-going providence for the human race. Said Martin Luther.

When we are given the talents, we should receive it, and keep it, and use it to serve others, and get more talents from our serving. As for skills, if we use our skills to serve others, at least we will practice our skills more to make it better than before, and if we try to serve others more by our skills, we will develop our skills, make it more than before, even double it.

The work of Jesus includes Teaching, Preaching, and Healing. Our professor said about our school as a perfect imitation of those three aspects of Jesus’ work, we have university to teach, we have a school of medicine to heal, and we have a seminary of theology to preach.

The spiritual battles of Jesus Christ, in the land of human’s heart.

Jesus is Love, Jesus Christ is Love, We should orient our heart toward his.

Sometimes we should tolerate others’ mistakes, but sometimes, especially in the area of education, we should correct the errors which will corrupt one’s soul or the whole environment. Said our professor.

The world is lost, but the God of the Bible does exist. Truth is truth, keep on!
