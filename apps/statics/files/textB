In ancient times, spirits entered humans directly. But nowadays, spirits enter humans rarely, especially in metropolitan cities, because spirits know the change of age, and changed their behavior, our professor says, they masqueraded themselves as angels of light, attractive ones, such as culture movement, those new and attractive ones. We should hide ourselves from the modern culture, because it’s dangerous if we expose ourselves to the modern culture.

There is even no television in our professor’s home. Television is not bad, because it’s the gift such as art God gives us, to let us enjoy his creation. The beautiful creations are not evil things, we need to discover those beautiful things, those attractive things are real angels of light, the good will of God. We need to enjoy those beautiful things and good thoughts of the One Good God. We should pray for the ability to distinguish those angels of light, because one of them are real servants of the only One Good God, but another one is the evil one Satan who masqueraded himself as an angel of light.

Hedonism is a thought that argues that pleasure is the primary or most important intrinsic good. A hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure (pleasure minus pain).

Hedonism is the ethical theory that pleasure (in the sense of the satisfaction of desires) is the highest good and proper aim of human life.

Ethical hedonism is the idea that all people have the right to do everything in their power to achieve the greatest amount of pleasure possible to them. It is also the idea that every person's pleasure should far surpass their amount of pain. Ethical hedonism is said to have been started by Aristippus of Cyrene, a student of Socrates. He held the idea that pleasure is the highest good.

Socrates, (469–399 bc), ancient Athenian philosopher. As represented in the writings of his disciple Plato, he engaged in dialogue with others in an attempt to reach understanding and ethical concepts by exposing and dispelling error (the Socratic method). Charged with introducing strange gods and corrupting the young, Socrates was sentenced to death and died by drinking hemlock.

If we eat well, the flesh will be well developed and our spirit will be weak, so they reduce their food and fast frequently. Our professor said about Hedonism and those monks. And if we seek alcohol and money, then we will seek sex and drugs, our professor said about those things what can make us happy in the age of Hedonism. They earn money to enjoy more, but after they earn more money, their lust is expanded too, so just having a little money is the grace of God, said our professor. The main factor of the people who live on this island don’t follow hedonism is that they have no money.

Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist, and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering.

Nihilism (/ˈnaɪ.ᵻlɪzəm/or /ˈniː.ᵻlɪzəm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilists assert that morality does not inherently exist, and that any established moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism can also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or that reality does not actually exist.

Epistemology (/ᵻˌpɪstᵻˈmɒlədʒi/; fromGreekἐπιστήμη, epistēmē, meaning "knowledge, understanding",and λόγος, logos, meaning "word") is a word first used by the Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier to describe the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge. It examines the nature of knowledge and how one can acquire it. Much of the debate in this field has focused on the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth, belief, and justification.

1 Samuel 2-30 “Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says, ‘Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me will be lightly esteemed.
despise鄙视；厌恶 
For a man who respects me, how can I disdain him? For a man who disdains me, I should respect him still, because I am a man, maybe there are some faults in me. Today is Friday, I’m in the church of pastor Shim now, and I went to see the pastor first, then went to the place where my mother lived. When I was eating my dinner, an elder came out from one room, and I stood up to bow to him to show my respect towards him. No one can disdain a man who respects him, because that disdains the respect of himself, unless he disdains himself and sees himself does not deserve respect, he cannot disdain a man who expresses respect to him. Remember the reaction of God when he faces man, and be careful that humans are the image of God.

There is one more reason that I should go to see the pastor before my mother, that’s the logic of the rainbow. When I see the rainbow in heaven, I shall not think about the rainbow, but the maker of heaven and earth, the covenant of the Lord, the mercy of God, the salvation of our Savior. Going to see my mother is the same thing as the above one thing of seeing the rainbow. I go to see my mother, and my mother can’t be the objective of our spirit, but the Only One God, I go to see my mother, and I shall think about the merciful God who gives me my mother. To express my respect to God my Father, I shall go to see the agent of my Father first, then go to see my mother and be glad of her and have a thankful heart of God, thus express thanks to his grace, to express that I’m very happy because of the grace of my Father, he’s so mercy to me.

I will describe your good deeds before my Father. April 25, 2021, before I go to church to worship, I met a sister who gave me many biscuit in winter vacation when I was getting water, coincidentally the Missionary of my Father besides me, so I mentioned the sister to the Missionary of my Father about her good deeds towards me in winter vacation.

Jesus is also revered outside of Christianity. In Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets and the messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was born of a virgin, but was neither God nor a begotten God. The Quran states that Jesus never claimed divinity. Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified, but that he was physically raised into Heaven by God. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected.

The different viewpoints about Reward between Catholic and Protestant, all of tehm admit that there is Reward, but Catholic thinks that’s merit, because of human’s works, on the contrary, Protestant thinks that’s grace, because of human’s faithful heart. Like a father gives his son money, and then his son buys some gift for him, he admires his son, because he is rich in charity and mercy.

Don’t pray anymore, if you pray constantly, we will have no professor to teach us. Said our brother Zheyu, about our sister Yanyan, and we laughed together, that made our professor become curious about our topic, and thus I translated the word of our brother for our professor by Korean. But it seems I don’t care about my sister's feelings, as she didn’t care about my feelings. I shall approach those men who have noble souls.

The form, measure and order of God’s goodness. The existence of humans is meaningful, no matter how good or bad that man is. Although it’s bad, the creature’s existence itself is good, for the one who created it is good. All creatures fulfill the purpose of his creator, that’s the blessing of God, the gift of God. 
measure办法，措施 量器order次序，顺序 
All of us exist because of others, but God exists just because of himself. Jesus didn’t entrust himself to those followers, Jesus knew everyone, Jesus exists because of himself. He saves us just because he wants to save us, there are no reasons, just because of himself. But God loves us so much that he asks love from us, it seems if we don’t love him, he will lose something precious. All of these just because he loves us. 

Humans can live without the love of parents or others, it seems humans can live without others, but we can’t live without God. If we lose our hands, still we can live, but how about the hands? If we lose our head, our whole body will die, and the head lives alone. We are the body of Jesus Christ, he is our head. Without us he will still live like the former days without us, but he loves us, thus he can’t lose us, just because he loves us. 

Humans are worship creatures. 

One Essence, Latin version is “una essentia“, Greek version is “mia ousia”. Three Persons, Latin version is “tres personae”, Greek version is “treis hypostaseis”. The three persons of one Essence have the same substance, the same power, the same eternity. They are One in Charity. Charity expressed in the motion for unity. 

Father’s personhood, not born. Son’s personhood: eternal generation. Spirit’s personhood: eternal procession. To understand the word “born” and “procession”, we can think about “intellect” and “will”, “word” and “love”. 
Personhood做人；人格
Personhood is the status of being a person.

When our professor said “Love your neighbor as yourself” after we sang a song, my sister said to me, “Buy lunch for me!” But I respond, “You love me and you let me buy food for you?

God saved me by his measureless wisdom and foresight.

He has shown you, O man, what is good.  What does Yahweh require of you, but to act justly,  to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God. Our professor let us remember this verse of Micah 6:8, the key verse of Micah. 

If we follow the footsteps of Jesus who bear his cross, we needn’t say anything but follow him. However, in churches of this age, we said many things, and didn't follow Jesus after we left church. Said our professor.

We should use and develop our talents which God gives us, our professor said, and mentioned about my English version summary, said that although it’s difficult to write by English at first, after you use it more, practice it more, and develop it more, you will get more English skills and knowledge. The conclusion is that “we shall use and develop the talents which God gives us.”

The motto of the school of life’s river: To work is to pray, To pray is to work. The original motto is “pray and work”, but afterwards, the motto changed, and they have the same meaning, our professor said.

Every activity can be transformed into an act of Worship.

Worship is a lifestyle, what you do throughout the day is your act of worship to God.

Even if your body isn’t healthy, your soul overcomes that, it doesn’t even care, it worships anyway, it's joyful anyway. That’s what God wants to give you in your life.

If the man who was robbed by robbers was met by those scribes before temple, they will save him, our professor said, because that event will be seen by others, so they will do, but in a desert, there are no one could see their good deeds, so they don’t care about the man who was robbed by robbers. They are living before man, but we shall live before the face of God, like our motto, Coram Deo, before the face of God.

Every occupation has its own honor before God. Ordinary work is a divine vocation or calling. In our daily work no matter how important or mundane we serve God by serving the neighbor and we also participate in God’s on-going providence for the human race. Said Martin Luther.
