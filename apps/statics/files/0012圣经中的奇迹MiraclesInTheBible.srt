00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:14,980
This video is longer than most of my videos. because the teaching is important.
这个视频比我的绝大多数视频都要长。因为这个教导很重要。

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,140
I want you to understand it well.
我希望你能很好地理解它。

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,200
What I will say will shock many people. You may think I have no faith in God.
我要说的话会让很多人震惊。你可能认为我对上帝没有信心。

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,420
But I must tell you what Jesus really said about miracles.
但我必须告诉你耶稣所说的真正的关于神迹的事。

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:43,040
First, I will show how we misunderstand the Bible by not listening closely.
首先，我要说明我们的不仔细聆听是如何误解圣经的。

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:52,940
I need to clear this up,so we can hear the truth about what Jesus said.
我需要澄清这一点，这样我们才能听到真正的耶稣所说的话。

7
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:01,400
Most of us read the Bible selfishly.
我们大多数人都自私地阅读圣经。

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:14,460
Listen to this verse from the Book of Acts: It is Peter preaching on the Day of Pentecost.
听听使徒行传中的这节经文：这是彼得在五旬节那天的讲道。

9
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:27,200
“This is what the prophet Joel predicted: God promised to give his Spirit to everyone.
使徒行传 2-16 这正是先知约珥所说的：使徒行传 2-17...我要将我的灵浇灌凡有血气的，

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,920
"Your children,” he said, "will prophesy. “Young men will see visions, and old men will dream dreams.”
“你们的儿女，”他说，“会说预言。 “少年人会见异象，老人会做异梦。”

11
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:43,020
“My servants and maids will receive my Spirit. They, too, will prophesy.”
“我的仆人和使女会领受我的灵。他们也会说预言。”

12
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:52,080
“I will show signs in heaven and on earth: Blood, and fire, and smoke.”
“我要在天上地下显出迹象：有血、有火、有烟雾。

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:00,580
When you hear that, do you feel like God gave his Spirit  to these thousands of people…
当你听到这些时，你是否觉得上帝将他的灵赐给了这成千上万的人……

14
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,520
…so that they would all be able  to do miraculous things?
……让他们都能行神迹？

15
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,560
It sounds like that, doesn’t it?
听起来是这样，不是吗？

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,220
But before we say too much, I want you to think…
但在我们说太多之前，我想让你想想……

17
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,600
Think of all those thousands of people (not counting the apostles).
想想那成千上万的人（不包括使徒）。

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,240
How many miracles can you  remember them doing?
你能记得他们行了多少神迹？

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,360
Any healings? It is not easy to think of any, is it?
有什么医治吗？很难想起来任何一个，是吗？

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,320
I’m thinking mostly of healings.
我想到的主要是医治。

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Thousands of people talked in tongues. Many prophesied and preached.
成千上万的人用方言交谈。许多人预言并传道。

22
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,660
I’m thinking about the kind of miracles  that do not happen in churches today.
我在想今天在教堂里不会发生的那种神迹。

23
00:02:51,660 --> 00:03:03,280
In I Corinthians 12, Paul said that not everyone can do miracles, and not everyone can heal people.
在哥林多前书 12 章，保罗说不是每个人都能行神迹，也不是每个人都能医治人。

24
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,400
In Acts 2:43 it says it was the apostles who did the miracles.
使徒行传 2:43 说是使徒行了神迹。

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:20,180
It does not say that anyone who was not an apostle, did miracles.
并没有说任何不是使徒的人都行过神迹。

26
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:28,460
Even at the time, no one believed  that everyone could do miracles.
即使在那个时候，也没有人相信每个人都能行神迹。

27
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,460
Only the apostles did them. We need to see that.
只有使徒这样做了。我们需要看到这一点。

28
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:40,840
Stop for a minute. I am not trying to change the truth.
先稍等片刻。我不是要改变真相。

29
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:49,400
I want us to see pieces of truth that we don’t like to see.
我希望我们能看到我们不喜欢看到的那些真相。

30
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,440
We want to believe they all did miracles; So we can, too.
我们想相信他们都行了神迹；那样我们就也可以。

31
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,200
That is our dream: That the Holy Spirit is all about miracles.
那是我们的梦想：圣灵就是一切关于神迹的东西。

32
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,100
More Holy Spirit equals bigger and better miracles.
更多的圣灵等于更大更好的神迹。

33
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:14,380
But that may not be true. Are you open to that being true?
但这可能不是真的。你愿意接受这个事实吗？

34
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:23,420
Maybe the apostles had more Holy Spirit, and it is why they did miracles.
也许使徒有更多的圣灵，这就是他们行神迹的原因。

35
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,680
Remember, the apostles did miracles.
请记住，使徒行了神迹。

36
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:37,400
Listen to what Paul the Apostle said in I Corinthians 2:4…
听听使徒保罗在哥林多前书 2:4 中所说的话……

37
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:47,040
My preaching was not with beautiful words, but with power from God’s Spirit.
哥林多前书 2-4 我说的话，讲的道，不是用智慧委婉的言语，乃是用圣灵和大能的明证，

38
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,000
It sounds like Paul was doing miracles in every city that he visited.
听起来像是保罗在他访问过的每个城市都在行神迹。

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,040
And people listened to him  because he did miracles.
人们听他，因为他行了神迹。

40
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,540
But we will do with Paul  what we did with the non-apostles:
但是我们会对保罗做我们对非使徒所做的事情：

41
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,500
How many miracles of Paul can you list?
你能列举出多少保罗的神迹？

42
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,600
Stop the video and make a list. How many can you remember?
停止视频并列出清单。你能记住几个？

43
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,240
Paul did miracles, but we don’t remember them, do we?
保罗行过神迹，但我们不记得他们，对吗？

44
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:33,640
I think he mostly did miracles  for emergencies and not for a show.
我认为他主要是为了紧急情况而不是为了表演而行神迹。

45
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,640
His real job was to preach.
他真正的工作是传道。

46
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:46,600
A snake bit him, and he was not hurt.
一条蛇咬了他，他没有受伤。

47
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:57,500
A man fell out of a high window and died.
一名男子从高窗坠下身亡。

48
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:05,260
Paul fell on him and hugged him, and then he told the people the man was not dead.
保罗扑在他身上并拥抱他，然后他告诉人们这个人并没有死。

49
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:12,400
In Acts 13, Paul made a man become blind.

He cast a demon out of a woman in Acts 16.
在使徒行传 16 章，他从一个女人身上赶出一个鬼。

53
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,200
In Acts 19 is a strange story.
在使徒行传 19 中有一个奇怪的故事。

54
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:38,960
Christians took Paul’s handkerchiefs  and gave them to sick people, who were healed.
基督徒拿了保罗的手帕，递给病人，病人痊愈了。

55
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:54,940
We don’t who, how, or when, but some people were healed without Paul being there.
我们不知道是谁，如何或何时，但有些人在没有保罗在场的情况下被治愈了。

56
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,340
That’s all we know about Paul and miracles.
这就是我们对保罗和神迹的全部了解。

57
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:08,500
It’s surprising that we don’t  know more than that.
令人惊讶的是，我们不知道的更多。

58
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,080
People do not think of miracles when they think of Paul.

59
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,560
Now for the other apostles.

Stop the video and make a list.

62
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,240
Did you get the one about  the lame man in the temple?

64
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:42,080
It says in two places that Stephen, Phillip, and Barnabas did miracles, but that’s all.
它在两处说司提反、腓利和巴拿巴行了神迹，但仅此而已。

65
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,580
In Acts 9, Peter heals a man, and he brings Tabitha back to life.
在使徒行传第 9 章，彼得医治了一个人，他使大比大复活。

66
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,900
An earthquake opened a prison for Paul and Silas.

67
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,220
But they didn’t do the miracle themselves.

68
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:06,940
After the day of Pentecost, the Bible describes in detail less than ten miracles.
五旬节之后，圣经详细描述了不到十个神迹。

69
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:14,440
On the whole, The Book of Acts  is quiet about miracles.
总体而言，《使徒行传》对神迹保持沉默。

70
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,840
They happened, but little more is said about them.
它们发生了，但关于它们的说法很少。

71
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,120
We learn two lessons from this.
我们从中学到了两个教训。

72
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:34,100
1. God did miracles. They did not stop  after Jesus went to heaven.
1. 神行了神迹。耶稣升天后，他们并没有停止。

73
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:45,680
2. God still does miracles today. I have seen three or four  real miracles, myself.
2. 神今天仍然行神迹。我自己见过三四个真正的神迹。

74
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,380
I didn’t do them, but God did.
我没有这样做，但上帝做了。

75
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:58,360
Point one: God does miracles… Then, and now.
第一点：上帝行神迹......然后，现在。

76
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:10,360
But Point two is that  they were mostly secret.
但第二点是它们大多是秘密的。

77
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:18,340
They were not used to  preach sermons.
他们不曾讲道。

78
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,520
If a miracle happened or not was not important to most people.
神迹是否发生对大多数人来说并不重要。

79
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:31,200
Everyone was faithful, with or without a miracle.
无论有没有神迹，每个人都是信实的

80
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,220
This is most important today.
这是今天最重要的。

81
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:42,280
The Bible says that lying miracles will happen in the last days.
圣经说在末世会发生假神迹。

82
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:49,660
The Antichrist and the False Prophet will both be able to do miracles.
敌基督者和假先知都能够行神迹。

83
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:58,740
Smart magicians can copy almost any miracle.
聪明的魔术师几乎可以复制任何神迹。

84
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:07,820
We must find out if God wants us to do miracles...
我们必须弄清楚上帝是否希望我们行神迹……

85
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,740
…or if he has something  better for us.
……或者他有更好的东西给我们。

86
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,940
Maybe WE are the ones  who want to do miracles.
也许“我们”才是想要行神迹的人。

87
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,380
But we say that GOD wants us to do miracles.
但是我们说上帝要我们行神迹。

88
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:30,740
What we read in the New Testament, from people like Peter, James, and John, are teachings.
我们在新约中读到的 来自像彼得、雅各和约翰这样的人的教导。

89
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,980
And none of them teach about miracles.
他们都没有教导神迹。

90
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,940
Miracles happened, yes.But there was no big show and no teaching about them.
神迹发生了，是的。但是没有大秀，也没有关于这些的教导。

91
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,140
Please be patient with me. I will teach what Jesus taught soon.
请对我有点耐心。我很快就会教导耶稣所教导的。

92
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,040
I just want to get the bigger picture first.
我只是先看大局。

93
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,920
I will look at something I see in many letters that I receive.
我会看看我在收到的许多信件中看到的东西。

94
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:08,180
Some say they have done miracles. Others say they will do miracles.
有人说他们行了神迹。其他人说他们将要行神迹。

95
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,980
So I should listen to them.
所以我应该听他们的。

96
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:26,920
But what they say mostly takes me away from Jesus and just makes them special.
但他们所说的几乎是让我远离耶稣，并把他们变得特别。

97
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,780
Where does this thinking come from?
这种想法从何而来？

98
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:39,760
It comes from us thinking that miracles will build God’s kingdom.
它来自于我们认为神迹会建立上帝的国度。

99
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,940
People will listen  if we do miracles.
如果我们行神迹，人们会听。

100
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:52,160
So preachers say, “If you do this, you will get your miracles.”
所以传道人说：“如果你这样做，你就会得到神迹。”

101
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,300
They tell us to say a miracle happened when a miracle has not happened.
他们告诉我们，即使神迹没有发生，也要说神迹发生了。

102
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:08,980
They try to make themselves special... Better than all the other preachers.
他们试图让自己变得特别……比所有其他传道人都好。

103
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,040
Oral Roberts said that he had raised  20 people from the dead.
欧罗·罗伯茨说，他已经使 20 人从死里复活。

104
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:24,520
When pushed to prove it, he admitted he had not raised anyone from the dead.
当被要求证明这一点时，他承认他没有使任何人从死里复活。

105
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,060
Other preachers say  that angels talk to them.
其他传道人说天使对他们说话。

106
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,620
They teach them secrets that only they know.
他们教给他们只有他们知道的秘密。

107
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:41,460
Others say they went to heaven and they talked with God.
其他人说他们去了天堂并与上帝交谈。

108
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,300
And it works!
并且这样说很有效！

109
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,900
People love it.
人们喜欢它。

110
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,020
The bigger the lie, the more who will come to listen.
谎言越大，来听的人就越多。

111
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:02,300
But in the Book of Acts it was the opposite.
但在使徒行传中，情况正好相反。

112
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,200
A lot of miracles happened.
发生了很多神迹。

113
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,340
But the right hand did not know what the left hand did.
但是右手不知道左手做了什么。

114
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,600
From our study of the Book of Acts we know they did not talk about it.
从我们对使徒行传的研究我们知道他们没有谈论它。

115
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:26,820
But in the gospels, hundreds of miracles happened.
但在福音书中，发生了数百个神迹。

116
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,140
And there are stories of dozens of separate miracles.
还有几十个独立的神迹的故事。

117
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,400
At times, Jesus healed  everyone who came to him.
有时，耶稣会医治每个来到他面前的人。

118
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:47,100
Jesus said his followers would do even better things than he did.
耶稣说他的门徒会做比他做的更大的事。

119
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:58,840
Some verses sound like Jesus did many miracles, and  he wants us to do the same thing.
有些经文听起来像是耶稣行了许多神迹，他希望我们也做同样的事。

120
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,080
Why are we not doing them?
为什么我们不做呢？

121
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,100
Not enough faith is part of it.
没有足够的信心是其中的一部分。

122
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:11,860
But why did the early Christians not do more miracles?
但是为什么早期的基督徒没有多行神迹呢？

123
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Some preachers say they  are doing many miracles.
有些传道人说他们正在行许多神迹。

124
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,040
They say God will do miracles for you, if you just tell him to do miracles.
他们说上帝会为你行神迹，只要你告诉他行神迹。

125
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,640
"Say it, and get it," they say.
“说出来，得到它，”他们说。

126
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,020
But none will go through a hospital and cure even half of the patients.
但不会有人会经过一家医院，就能治愈甚至一半的病人。

127
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:34,820
The truth is that miracles  mostly do not happen today.
事实上，神迹在今天大多不会发生。

128
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:43,140
Those who say they can do miracles usually turn out to be exaggerating.
那些说他们可以行神迹的人通常被证明是夸大其词。

129
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:54,320
Jesus did many miracles. But if it was to show off…
耶稣行了许多神迹。但如果是为了炫耀……

130
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:02,080
...why did he tell so many people to keep it secret?
……他为什么要告诉这么多人保密？

131
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,220
Is that how today’s preachers do it?
今天的传道人是这样作的吗？

132
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:14,020
If Jesus was against showing off, then why did he do miracles?
如果耶稣反对炫耀，那他为什么要行神迹呢？

133
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,940
In Matthew 20:34  Jesus meets 3 blind men.
在马太福音 20:34 耶稣遇见了三个瞎子。

134
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,440
It says, “Jesus loved them, and he touched their eyes.
经上说：“耶稣爱他们，摸他们的眼睛。

135
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,820
“They were healed, and they followed him.”
“他们痊愈了，就跟从了他。”

136
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,440
Jesus loved people.
耶稣爱人。

137
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,080
The Bible says Jesus loved the multitudes.
圣经说耶稣爱众人。

138
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,180
He loved a widow whose son had died. He loved a blind man.
他爱一个死了儿子的寡妇。他爱一个盲人。

139
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:50,140
Jesus told a story when asked how to live forever:
当被问及如何永生时，耶稣关于爱神爱邻舍讲了一个故事：

140
00:15:50,140 --> 00:16:00,720
"A Samaritan saw an injured man and he loved him.
“一个撒玛利亚人看到一个受伤的人，就爱他。

141
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,320
“He put medicine on the wounds and bandaged him.
“他在伤口上涂药并包扎。

142
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,320
“He put him on his donkey and took him to a hotel and cared for him."
“他把他放在驴子上，带他去旅馆照顾他。”

143
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Both stories talk about healing. Both say healing comes from love.
两个故事都在谈论医治。两者都说医治来自爱。

144
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,000
They are not trying  to prove anything.
他们不想证明任何事情。

145
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,880
The Samaritan does not do a miracle.
撒玛利亚人不会行神迹。

146
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,300
How does that go together with the miracles that Jesus did?
这与耶稣所行的神迹有什么关系？

147
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,620
Jesus had infinite power.
耶稣有无限的能力。

148
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:44,200
Everything that was made  was made by him.
被造的一切都是靠他所造的。

149
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,780
If the Creator of the world is here on Earth as a human…
如果世界的创造者作为人类来到地球上……

150
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,220
What would he do if he loved someone?
如果他爱一个人，他会怎么做？

151
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,080
He healed!
他医治了对方！

152
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,660
Just as naturally as did the Good Samaritan.
就像好撒玛利亚人一样自然。

153
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:07,520
When Jesus felt love, his touch was miraculous.
当耶稣感受到爱时，他的触摸是神迹般的。

154
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,300
But he compliments and does not criticise...
但他是肯定而不是批评

155
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:25,760
...the one who used medicine: Alcohol, and oil.
...使用药物的人：酒和油。

156
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:35,520
Jesus says that this nursing care is a good example of what it takes to receive eternal life.
耶稣说这种照顾是一个很好的例子关于如果获得永生。

157
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,120
Why?
为什么？

158
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,620
Because it came from a heart of love.
因为它来自一颗爱的心。

159
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,640
NOW…
现在…

160
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,980
What did Jesus teach about miracles?
耶稣对神迹有什么教导？

161
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:59,060
Maybe you will understand it better now. It is a little shocking.
也许你现在会更好地理解它。这有点令人震惊。

162
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:07,400
The same teaching is repeated two times In Matthew 12 and in Matthew 16.
同样的教导在马太福音 12 章和马太福音 16 章重复了两次。

163
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:15,700
Jesus said an evil and unfaithful world wants miracles.
耶稣说一个邪恶和淫乱的世界想要神迹。

164
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,220
But they will not receive a miracle. Apart from the miracle of Jonah.
但他们不会得到神迹。除了约拿的神迹。

165
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:30,840
Like so many teachings of Jesus,  they hide this one too.
就像耶稣的许多教导一样，他们也隐藏了这一点。

166
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,180
Pentecostals are not the only ones who hide the truth about miracles.
五旬节派并不是唯一隐瞒神迹真相的人。

167
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:41,620
Catholics and Pentecostals both measure spirituality by miracles.
天主教徒和五旬节教徒都通过神迹来衡量灵性。

168
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:51,280
To be a Saint in the Catholic Church, you must do at least one miracle.
要成为天主教会的圣人，您必须至少行一个神迹。

169
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,540
They say that sticks and stones  and statues do magical healings.
他们说棍棒、石头和雕像有神奇的治疗作用。

170
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,060
Like the miracle waters of Lourdes.
就像卢尔德的神迹之水。

171
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,340
Statues that cry, and sores that never go away…
哭泣的雕像和永不消退的疮……

172
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:14,920
Are all used to say that God  is in their church.
都习惯说上帝在他们的教会里。

173
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,460
Catholics could teach Pentecostals a few things!
天主教徒可以教五旬节派一些东西！

174
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:24,260
But what did Jesus say is behind  all of this?
但耶稣说这一切的背后是什么？

175
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:31,040
Say it: An evil and unfaithful world.
说吧：一个邪恶和淫乱的世界。

176
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,000
Do you believe that?
你相信吗？

177
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,200
Do you believe Jesus?
你相信耶稣吗？

178
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,800
Do you see why I said this teaching is hard to believe?
你明白我为什么说这个教导令人难以置信吗？

179
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,300
Again:  Miracles happen!
我们再说：神迹发生了！

180
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,460
But God is the Boss. It is his choice.
但上帝是老板。这是他的选择。

181
00:19:49,460 --> 00:20:00,100
Only an evil and unfaithful world  thinks miracles will fix the world.
只有邪恶和淫乱的世界才会认为神迹会修复世界。

182
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:08,140
The second half of Jesus’ teaching will help us to understand.
耶稣教导的后半部分将帮助我们理解。

183
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:15,340
An evil world will only receive the miracle of Jonah.
一个邪恶的世界只有约拿的神迹。

184
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:25,320
Jonah was inside a whale for three days like Jesus was buried for three days..
约拿在一条鲸鱼里待了三天，就像耶稣被埋葬了三天一样。

185
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,020
Is that the miracle  that the world will receive?
难道这就是世界将有的神迹？

186
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:38,020
How can we make today’s evil world  believe that Jesus arose from the dead?
我们如何让今天的邪恶世界相信耶稣从死里复活？

187
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,940
The real question is this: Do WE believe it?
真正的问题是：我们相信吗？

188
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:50,120
Jonah never told Nineveh about his miracle.
约拿从未告诉尼尼微他的神迹。

189
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,400
He did not do a miracle for the people of Nineveh.
他没有为尼尼微人行神迹。

190
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,300
He just told them the truth.
他只是告诉了他们真理。

191
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:04,280
Change or die! That’s it.
改变或死亡！而已。

192
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:13,620
That is what we must say. They are headed for hell.
这是我们必须说的。他们正走向地狱。

193
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,280
Inside the church, and outside of it…
教堂里面，外面……

194
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,660
We are living in an evil  and unfaithful world.
我们生活在一个邪恶和淫乱的世界。

195
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,100
There will be NO  miracles on demand.
不会有按着我们要求的神迹。

196
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,780
Not any that we can tell people about.
我们没有任何可以告诉人们的。

197
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,140
The miracle was just between Jonah and God.
神迹只在约拿和上帝之间。

198
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:42,840
This is the same as what we have learned by looking at miracles in the New Testament.
这与我们通过查看新约中的神迹所学到的相同。

199
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,600
Miracles happen! But you don’t talk about them.
神迹发生！但你不谈论他们。

200
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:56,120
And they only happen for people who will obey Jesus with or without a miracle.
它们只会发生在那些无论有没有神迹都会服从耶稣的人身上。

201
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:05,980
Jesus tells us to go and preach. The miracles will “follow”.
耶稣告诉我们去传道。神迹会“跟随”。

202
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,860
“Follow” means they don’t happen until after we start obeying.
“跟随”意味着它们不会开始，直到我们开始顺服。

203
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:17,180
And it says nothing about  us controlling the miracles.
它没有说我们控制神迹。

204
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:23,520
God does as he chooses. If we disagree, then we are  part of what group?
上帝按他的选择行事。如果我们不同意，那么我们属于哪个群体？

205
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,340
The evil, unfaithful world that we now live in.
我们现在生活的 邪恶、淫乱的世界。

206
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:37,100
It will not be easy for those who have believed for years that it is all about miracles.
对于多年来一直相信这一切都是有关于神迹的人来说，这并不容易。

207
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:44,420
Jesus says that thinking comes from: An evil and unfaithful world.
耶稣说思想来自：一个邪恶和淫乱的世界。

208
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:51,720
Pastors who make a show of such things Sunday after Sunday…
牧师们一个星期天又一个星期天的展示这种事情……

209
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,400
Are apostles of what? An evil and unfaithful world.
他们是什么的使徒？一个邪恶和淫乱的世界的。

210
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,060
Leave them! Let them go to hell without you.
离开他们！不要跟他们一直走向灭亡。

211
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,320
And let them take their  lying miracles with them.
让他们随身带着他们的谎言神迹一起。

212
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,060
They will never teach you to obey Jesus.
他们永远不会教你顺服耶稣。

213
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,440
Every one of those miracle men is a false apostle.
这些神迹人中的每一个都是假使徒。

214
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,920
The voice of an evil and unfaithful world.
邪恶和淫乱的世界的声音。

215
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,060
Leave them and turn to Jesus before they take you to hell.
在他们带你下地狱之前，离开他们转向耶稣。

216
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,300
That is where they are going if they will not turn to Jesus.
如果他们不转向耶稣，那就是他们要去的地方。

217
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,060
Many of you don’t like hearing this.
你们中的许多人不喜欢听到这个。

218
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:46,700
But if you can hear it, you will start to grow as God wants you to grow.
但如果你能听到它，你就会开始成长，就像上帝希望你成长。

219
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,240
Please pray about it.
请为此祷告。

220
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,300
Drop the false hope of miracles, and hold to Jesus with both hands.
放弃神迹的虚假盼望，双手抱住耶稣。

221
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,200
Before I finish, I will look at something that I said near the start of this video.
在我结束之前，我将看一下我在视频开头所说的内容。

222
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:10,240
Jesus said his followers will do better things that he did.
耶稣说他的追随者会做得比他做得更大。

223
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:20,040
This promise says we can do something  better than raising Lazarus from the dead.
这个应许说我们可以做一些比让拉撒路从死里复活更大的事情。

224
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:31,480
How can we do better than that?
我们怎样才能做得更大？

225
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:42,040
Think about this: Did Lazarus still die in the end? And did he stay dead that time?
想一想：拉撒路最后还是死了吗？那时他死了吗？

226
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:50,220
Anyone raised from the dead in the Bible, apart from when Jesus came back to life…
圣经中任何从死里复活的人，除了耶稣复活的时候……

227
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,560
Was only for a few years.
只是让多活几年而已，玛门往往也能。

228
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,800
The one thing better than  being raised to life for a few years…
比被复活几年更好的一件事......

229
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,660
…is to give someone eternal life.
……是给某人永生。

230
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,260
I will say it again.  Think about it:
我再说一遍。想想看：

231
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:08,380
The only thing better than being raised to life for a few years…
唯一比复活几年更好的事情......

232
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,660
…is being raised to life forever.
……复活到永远。

233
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,620
Now, look at I Corinthians 12.
现在，请看哥林多前书 12 章。

234
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,720
Paul says there are many  different gifts in the church.
保罗说教会中有许多不同的恩赐。

235
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,780
Healing and miracles were, to Paul, two very different gifts.
对保罗来说，医治和神迹是两种截然不同的恩赐。

236
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:33,700
So maybe the Good Samaritan had  a non-miraculous gift of healing.
所以也许好撒玛利亚人有一种非神迹般的医治恩赐。

237
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:41,800
He poured oil and wine into the wound. He had the gift of healing.
他把油和酒倒在伤口上。他有医治的恩赐。

238
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:51,640
At the end of I Corinthians 12, Paul says,  “I will show you something better.”
在哥林多前书 12 章的结尾，保罗说：“我要给你看更大的东西，最妙的东西。”

239
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,820
Here it is!  A better way.   Better than miracles!
这里是！更大。比各样恩赐更妙！

240
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,520
Better than tongues! Even better than prophecy!
胜过方言！甚至比预言更好！

241
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:07,140
That is the start to the wonderful “love chapter” of I Corinthians 13.
这就是哥林多前书 13 章美妙的“爱的篇章”的开始。

242
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:17,860
“If I speak in tongues and do not have love, I am just making noise.  Nothing more.
“如果我说方言而没有爱，我只是在制造噪音。而已。

243
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:26,440
He then says that all the gifts of God, whether miraculous or not…
然后他说上帝的所有恩赐，无论是否神奇……

244
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,080
Are like looking through a cloudy mirror when you see this better way.
相比于你看到的这种更好的方式，那些就像透过模糊的镜子在看，

245
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,600
The better way is love. God’s supernature love.
更好的方式是爱。神超自然的爱。

246
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Christ loved like that.
基督那样的爱。

247
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:51,800
But he wants us to  show the world that love too.
但他也希望我们向世界展示那爱。

248
00:26:51,800 --> 00:27:00,020
Not the miracles of an evil, unfaithful world, but God’s real answer to our problems.
不是邪恶、淫乱的世界的神迹，而是上帝对我们问题的真正答案。

249
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,440
Love! The strength of God to change us.
爱！神改变我们的力量。

250
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,620
That’s it. I’ll leave it there.
而已。我会把它留在那里。

251
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,380
You can hear more about this in my video Named “The Greatest Rule”.
您可以在我名为“最伟大的规则”的视频中了解更多相关信息。

252
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,220
I hope to hear from you, and encourage you to grow in Jesus.
我希望听到你的声音，并鼓励你在耶稣里成长。

253
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:25,700
Please write to me. And share this video with others.
请写信给我。并与他人分享此视频。

254
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,960
Thank you for listening. God bless you.
谢谢你的聆听。上帝祝福你。
