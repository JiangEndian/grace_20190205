* Questions 1 through 5. Listen to a conversation in a university office.
M: Good afternoon. May I help you?
W: Yes, I hope so. My name is Jennifer Taylor, and I’m in the communications program. Our class is doing a radio program, and we’ll have interviews with a lot of people from all pans of campus life. We’d like to interview the new Dean of Students, if he’s willing.
M: Hmm. That sounds interesting.
W: I hope Dean Evans will agree to meet with us, and let us tape the conversation for the radio. It would be a way for the whole community to get to know him, get to know his ideas and everything ... like the kind of vision he has for the university.
M: How much time would you need?
W: Oh, probably about an hour, no more than that.
M: Hmm. I’m sure the dean would like to participate, but ... uh ... you know, his schedule is pretty tight.
W: Oh, I was afraid of that. Um ...
M: He’s tied up all this week. Everybody wants to. you know, get acquainted. But we can probably work something in. When would you like to do the interview?
W: The radio station can air the show on either the 16th or the 23rd, so we’d have to work around that.
M: Let me look at the dean’s schedule ... Let’s see ... it looks like he’s got a lot of meetings this week, and, well, most of next week, too. What about the week after that? He doesn’t have anything scheduled on Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon. Would either of those days work for you?
W: Urn, yeah. I think so. How about Tuesday afternoon?
M: On Tuesday, he’s free from two o’clock till four- thirty.
W: Let’s see. I’ll be in class until two-thirty, so how about three?
M: All right. Three o’clock, Tuesday, April 15.
W: OK, that will be great. Thank you so much. This will be a great way for everyone to learn about our new dean. We really appreciate the opportunity to do this.
M: You're really quite welcome. It's our pleasure. In fact, I’ve put it on the dean’s calendar, and we will see you on the 15th.
W: The 15th. OK. Thank you very much.
