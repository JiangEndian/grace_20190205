Leviticus 5-1 <pb/>“If anyone sins in that he hears a public <f>ⓐ</f>adjuration to testify, and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall <f>ⓑ</f>bear his iniquity;
Leviticus 5-2 or <f>ⓒ</f>if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean, and he realizes his guilt;
Leviticus 5-3 or if he touches <f>ⓓ</f>human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and realizes his guilt;
Leviticus 5-4 or if anyone utters with his lips a <f>ⓔ</f>rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that people <f>ⓕ</f>swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and he realizes his guilt in any of these;
Leviticus 5-5 when he realizes his guilt in any of these and <f>ⓖ</f>confesses the sin he has committed,
Leviticus 5-6 he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation <f>[1]</f> for the sin that he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin.
Leviticus 5-7 <pb/>“But <f>ⓗ</f>if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation for the sin that he has committed two <f>ⓘ</f>turtledoves or two pigeons, <f>[2]</f> one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
Leviticus 5-8 He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering. He shall <f>ⓙ</f>wring its head from its neck <f>ⓚ</f>but shall not sever it completely,
Leviticus 5-9 and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while <f>ⓛ</f>the rest of the blood shall be drained out <f>ⓜ</f>at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus 5-10 Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the rule. <f>ⓝ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus 5-11 <pb/>“But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for the sin that he has committed a <f>ⓞ</f>tenth of an ephah <f>[3]</f> of fine flour for a sin offering. He <f>ⓟ</f>shall put no oil on it and shall put no frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
Leviticus 5-12 And he shall bring it to <f>ⓠ</f>the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and <f>ⓡ</f>burn this on the altar, on the LORD's food offerings; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus 5-13 Thus <f>ⓢ</f>the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder <f>[4]</f> shall be for the priest, as in the grain offering.”
Leviticus 5-14 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 5-15 <f>ⓣ</f> “If anyone commits a breach of faith and sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the LORD, <f>ⓤ</f>he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation, a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued <f>[5]</f> in silver shekels, <f>[6]</f> according to the <f>ⓥ</f>shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering.
Leviticus 5-16 He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and <f>ⓦ</f>shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. <f>ⓧ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus 5-17 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> “If anyone sins, doing any of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done, <f>ⓩ</f>though he did not know it, then realizes his guilt, he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus 5-18 <f>ⓐ</f> He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering, and <f>ⓑ</f>the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus 5-19 It is a guilt offering; he has indeed incurred guilt before <f>[7]</f> the LORD.”

Ezekiel 23-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 23-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, there were <f>ⓑ</f>two women, the daughters of one mother.
Ezekiel 23-3 <f>ⓒ</f> They played the whore in Egypt; <f>ⓓ</f>they played the whore <f>ⓔ</f>in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms <f>[1]</f> handled.
Ezekiel 23-4 Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. <f>ⓕ</f>They became mine, and they <f>ⓖ</f>bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is <f>ⓗ</f>Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
Ezekiel 23-5 <pb/>“Oholah played the whore <f>ⓘ</f>while she was mine, and <f>ⓙ</f>she lusted after her lovers <f>ⓚ</f>the Assyrians, warriors
Ezekiel 23-6 clothed in purple, <f>ⓛ</f>governors and commanders, <f>ⓜ</f>all of them desirable young men, <f>ⓝ</f>horsemen riding on horses.
Ezekiel 23-7 She bestowed her whoring upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them, and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone after whom she lusted.
Ezekiel 23-8 She did not give up her whoring <f>ⓞ</f>that she had begun in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their whoring lust upon her.
Ezekiel 23-9 Therefore <f>ⓟ</f>I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted.
Ezekiel 23-10 <f>ⓠ</f> These uncovered her nakedness; <f>ⓡ</f>they seized her sons and her daughters; and as for her, they killed her with the sword; and she became <f>ⓢ</f>a byword among women, <f>ⓣ</f>when judgment had been executed on her.
Ezekiel 23-11 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> “Her sister Oholibah saw this, and she became <f>ⓥ</f>more corrupt than her sister <f>[2]</f> in her lust and in her whoring, which was worse than that of her sister.
Ezekiel 23-12 She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, <f>ⓦ</f>all of them desirable young men.
Ezekiel 23-13 And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
Ezekiel 23-14 But she carried her whoring further. She saw men <f>ⓧ</f>portrayed on the wall, the <f>ⓨ</f>images of <f>ⓩ</f>the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
Ezekiel 23-15 wearing belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them having the appearance of officers, a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
Ezekiel 23-16 When she saw them, she lusted after them and <f>ⓐ</f>sent messengers to them <f>ⓑ</f>in Chaldea.
Ezekiel 23-17 And the Babylonians came to her <f>ⓒ</f>into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoring lust. And after she was defiled by them, <f>ⓓ</f>she turned from them in disgust.
Ezekiel 23-18 When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister.
Ezekiel 23-19 Yet she increased her whoring, <f>ⓔ</f>remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt
Ezekiel 23-20 and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses.
Ezekiel 23-21 Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed <f>[3]</f> your young breasts.”
Ezekiel 23-22 <pb/>Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I will stir up against you your lovers <f>ⓕ</f>from whom you turned in disgust, <f>ⓖ</f>and I will bring them against you from every side:
Ezekiel 23-23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, <f>ⓗ</f>Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, <f>ⓘ</f>desirable young men, <f>ⓙ</f>governors and commanders all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
Ezekiel 23-24 And they shall come against you from the north <f>[4]</f> with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples. <f>ⓚ</f>They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet; and <f>ⓛ</f>I will commit the judgment to them, and <f>ⓜ</f>they shall judge you according to their judgments.
Ezekiel 23-25 And I will direct my jealousy against you, <f>ⓝ</f>that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. <f>ⓞ</f>They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire.
Ezekiel 23-26 <f>ⓟ</f> They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewels.
Ezekiel 23-27 <f>ⓠ</f> Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and <f>ⓡ</f>your whoring begun in the land of Egypt, so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.
Ezekiel 23-28 <pb/>“For thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓢ</f>Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, <f>ⓣ</f>into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust,
Ezekiel 23-29 and <f>ⓤ</f>they shall deal with you in hatred and take away all the fruit of your labor <f>ⓥ</f>and leave you naked and bare, and <f>ⓦ</f>the nakedness of your whoring shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your whoring
Ezekiel 23-30 have brought this upon you, because <f>ⓧ</f>you played the whore with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.
Ezekiel 23-31 You have gone the way of your sister; <f>ⓨ</f>therefore I will give <f>ⓩ</f>her cup into your hand.
Ezekiel 23-32 Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t>“You shall drink your sister's cup </t><t>that is deep and large; </t><t>you shall be laughed at and held in derision, </t><t>for it contains much;</t>
Ezekiel 23-33 <t>you will be filled with <f>ⓐ</f>drunkenness and sorrow. </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>A cup of horror and desolation, </t><t>the cup of <f>ⓒ</f>your sister Samaria;</t>
Ezekiel 23-34 <t><f>ⓓ</f> you shall drink it and drain it out, </t><t>and gnaw its shards, </t><t>and tear your breasts; </t> <pb/>for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 23-35 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓔ</f>you have forgotten me and <f>ⓕ</f>cast me behind your back, you yourself <f>ⓖ</f>must bear the consequences of your lewdness and whoring.”
Ezekiel 23-36 <pb/>The LORD said to me: <f>ⓗ</f>“Son of man, <f>ⓘ</f>will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Declare to them their abominations.
Ezekiel 23-37 For <f>ⓙ</f>they have committed adultery, <f>ⓚ</f>and blood is on their hands. With their idols they have committed adultery, and they have even <f>ⓛ</f>offered up <f>[5]</f> to them for food the children whom they had borne to me.
Ezekiel 23-38 Moreover, this they have done to me: <f>ⓜ</f>they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and <f>ⓝ</f>profaned my Sabbaths.
Ezekiel 23-39 For when <f>ⓞ</f>they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day <f>ⓟ</f>they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And behold, <f>ⓠ</f>this is what they did in my house.
Ezekiel 23-40 They even sent for men to come from afar, <f>ⓡ</f>to whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came. For them you bathed yourself, <f>ⓢ</f>painted your eyes, <f>ⓣ</f>and adorned yourself with ornaments.
Ezekiel 23-41 You sat on <f>ⓤ</f>a stately couch, with a table spread before it <f>ⓥ</f>on which you had placed my incense and <f>ⓦ</f>my oil.
Ezekiel 23-42 The <f>ⓧ</f>sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the common sort, drunkards <f>[6]</f> were brought from the wilderness; and they put <f>ⓨ</f>bracelets on the hands of the women, and <f>ⓩ</f>beautiful crowns on their heads.
Ezekiel 23-43 <pb/>“Then I said of her who was worn out by adultery, ‘Now they will continue to use her for a whore, even her!’ <f>[7]</f>
Ezekiel 23-44 For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a prostitute. Thus they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, lewd women!
Ezekiel 23-45 But righteous men <f>ⓐ</f>shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses, and with the sentence of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.”
Ezekiel 23-46 <pb/>For thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓑ</f>“Bring up a vast host against them, and make them <f>ⓒ</f>an object of terror and <f>ⓓ</f>a plunder.
Ezekiel 23-47 <f>ⓔ</f> And the host shall stone them and cut them down with their swords. <f>ⓕ</f>They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and <f>ⓖ</f>burn up their houses.
Ezekiel 23-48 <f>ⓗ</f> Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done.
Ezekiel 23-49 And they shall return your lewdness upon you, and <f>ⓘ</f>you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry, and <f>ⓙ</f>you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.”
