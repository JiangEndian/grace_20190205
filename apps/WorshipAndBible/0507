22-3 but if the sun has risen on him, there shall be bloodguilt for him. He <f>[3]</f> shall surely pay. If he has nothing, then <f>ⓒ</f>he shall be sold for his theft.
22-4 If the stolen beast <f>ⓓ</f>is found alive in his possession, whether it is an ox or a donkey or a sheep, <f>ⓔ</f>he shall pay double.

22-7 <pb/>“If a man gives to his neighbor money or goods to keep safe, and it is stolen from the man's house, then, if the thief is found, <f>ⓕ</f>he shall pay double.
22-8 If the thief is not found, the owner of the house shall come near to God to show whether or not he has put his hand to his neighbor's property.
22-9 For every breach of trust, whether it is for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a cloak, or for any kind of lost thing, of which one says, ‘This is it,’ the case of both parties shall come before God. The one whom God condemns shall pay double to his neighbor.
22-10 <pb/>“If a man gives to his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep safe, and it dies or is injured or is driven away, without anyone seeing it,
22-11 <f>ⓖ</f> an oath by the LORD shall be between them both to see whether or not he has put his hand to his neighbor's property. The owner shall accept the oath, and he shall not make restitution.

1-1 <pb/>There was a man in the land of <f>ⓐ</f>Uz whose name was <f>ⓑ</f>Job, and that man was <f>ⓒ</f>blameless and upright, one who <f>ⓓ</f>feared God and <f>ⓔ</f>turned away from evil.
1-2 There were born to him <f>ⓕ</f>seven sons and three daughters.
1-3 He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all <f>ⓖ</f>the people of the east.
1-4 His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
1-5 And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and <f>ⓗ</f>consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and <f>ⓘ</f>offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my children have sinned, and <f>ⓙ</f>cursed <f>[1]</f> God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.
1-6 <pb/>Now there was a day when <f>ⓚ</f>the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and <f>ⓛ</f>Satan <f>[2]</f> also came among them.
1-7 The LORD said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Satan answered the LORD and said, “From <f>ⓜ</f>going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”
1-8 And the LORD said to Satan, “Have you <f>ⓝ</f>considered my <f>ⓞ</f>servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, <f>ⓟ</f>a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?”
1-9 Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “Does Job fear God for no reason?
1-10 Have you not put <f>ⓠ</f>a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have <f>ⓡ</f>blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
1-11 But <f>ⓢ</f>stretch out your hand and <f>ⓣ</f>touch all that he has, and he will <f>ⓤ</f>curse you <f>ⓥ</f>to your face.”
1-12 And the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand.” So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
1-13 <pb/>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
1-14 and there came a messenger to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
1-15 and <f>ⓦ</f>the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants <f>[3]</f> with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
1-16 While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, <f>ⓧ</f>“The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
1-17 While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, <f>ⓨ</f>“The Chaldeans formed <f>ⓩ</f>three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
1-18 While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, <f>ⓐ</f>“Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,
1-19 and behold, a great wind came across <f>ⓑ</f>the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
1-20 <pb/>Then Job arose and <f>ⓒ</f>tore his <f>ⓓ</f>robe and <f>ⓔ</f>shaved his head <f>ⓕ</f>and fell on the ground and worshiped.
1-21 And he said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I <f>ⓗ</f>return. The LORD <f>ⓘ</f>gave, and the LORD has taken away; <f>ⓙ</f>blessed be the name of the LORD.”
1-22 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> In all this Job did not sin or charge God with <f>ⓛ</f>wrong.
5-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; </t><t>look, and see <f>ⓑ</f>our disgrace!</t>

5-3 <t>We have become orphans, fatherless; </t><t>our mothers are like widows.</t>

5-5 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Our pursuers are at our necks; </t><t>we are weary; we are given no rest.</t>
5-6 <t>We have given the hand to <f>ⓔ</f>Egypt, and to <f>ⓕ</f>Assyria, </t><t>to get bread enough.</t>
5-7 <t>Our fathers sinned, and are no more; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>and we bear their iniquities.</t>
5-8 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Slaves rule over us; </t><t>there is none to deliver us from their hand.</t>
5-9 <t><f>ⓘ</f> We get our bread at the peril of our lives, </t><t>because of the sword in the wilderness.</t>
5-10 <t><f>ⓙ</f> Our skin is hot as an oven </t><t>with <f>ⓚ</f>the burning heat of famine.</t>
5-11 <t>Women are raped in Zion, </t><t>young women in the towns of Judah.</t>
5-12 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Princes are hung up by their hands; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>no respect is shown to the elders.</t>
5-13 <t>Young men are compelled to <f>ⓝ</f>grind at the mill, </t><t>and boys stagger <f>ⓞ</f>under loads of wood.</t>
5-14 <t><f>ⓟ</f> The old men have left the city gate, </t><t>the young men <f>ⓠ</f>their music.</t>
5-15 <t><f>ⓡ</f> The joy of our hearts has ceased; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>our dancing has been turned to mourning.</t>

5-19 <t><f>ⓧ</f> But you, O LORD, reign forever; </t><t>your throne endures to all generations.</t>
5-20 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Why do you forget us forever, </t><t>why do you forsake us for so many days?</t>
5-21 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored! </t><t>Renew our days as of old — </t>

1-1 <pb/>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God <f>ⓐ</f>gave him <f>ⓑ</f>to show to his servants <f>[1]</f> the things that must soon take place. <f>ⓒ</f>He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,

1-9 <pb/>I, John, your brother and <f>ⓐ</f>partner in <f>ⓑ</f>the tribulation and <f>ⓒ</f>the kingdom and <f>ⓓ</f>the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos <f>ⓔ</f>on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
1-10 <f>ⓕ</f> I was in the Spirit <f>ⓖ</f>on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice <f>ⓗ</f>like a trumpet
1-11 saying, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.”</J>
1-12 <pb/>Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw <f>ⓙ</f>seven golden lampstands,
1-13 and in the midst of the lampstands <f>ⓚ</f>one like <f>ⓛ</f>a son of man, <f>ⓜ</f>clothed with a long robe and <f>ⓝ</f>with a golden sash around his chest.
1-14 <f>ⓞ</f> The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. <f>ⓟ</f>His eyes were like a flame of fire,

1-16 <f>ⓢ</f> In his right hand he held seven stars, <f>ⓣ</f>from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and <f>ⓤ</f>his face was like the sun shining <f>ⓥ</f>in full strength.
1-17 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But <f>ⓧ</f>he laid his right hand on me, <f>ⓨ</f>saying, <J>“Fear not, <f>ⓩ</f>I am the first and the last,</J>
1-18 <J>and the living one. <f>ⓐ</f>I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and <f>ⓑ</f>I have the keys of Death and Hades.</J>
1-19 <J><f>ⓒ</f> Write therefore <f>ⓓ</f>the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this.</J>
1-20 <J>As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and <f>ⓔ</f>the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and <f>ⓕ</f>the seven lampstands are the seven churches.</J>
