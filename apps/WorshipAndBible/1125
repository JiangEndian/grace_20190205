7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when the king lived in his house and the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies,
7-2 the king said to <f>ⓒ</f>Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell <f>ⓓ</f>in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells <f>ⓔ</f>in a tent.”
7-3 And Nathan said to the king, <f>ⓕ</f>“Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”
7-4 <pb/>But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan,
7-5 “Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓖ</f>Would you build me a house to dwell in?
7-6 I have not lived in a house <f>ⓗ</f>since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about <f>ⓘ</f>in a tent for my dwelling.
7-7 In all places where <f>ⓙ</f>I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with <f>ⓚ</f>any of the judges <f>[1]</f> of Israel, whom I commanded <f>ⓛ</f>to shepherd my people Israel, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’
7-8 Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓜ</f>I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince <f>[2]</f> over my people Israel.
7-9 <f>ⓝ</f> And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
7-10 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel <f>ⓞ</f>and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place <f>ⓟ</f>and be disturbed no more. <f>ⓠ</f>And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly,
7-11 <f>ⓡ</f> from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And <f>ⓢ</f>I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that <f>ⓣ</f>the LORD will make you a house.
7-12 <f>ⓤ</f> When your days are fulfilled and <f>ⓥ</f>you lie down with your fathers, <f>ⓦ</f>I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
7-13 <f>ⓧ</f> He shall build a house for my name, and <f>ⓨ</f>I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
7-14 <f>ⓩ</f> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, <f>ⓐ</f>I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men,
7-15 <f>ⓑ</f> but my steadfast love will not depart from him, <f>ⓒ</f>as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you.
7-16 <f>ⓓ</f> And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>Your throne shall be established forever.’”
7-17 In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
7-18 <pb/>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, <f>ⓕ</f>“Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
7-19 And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord GOD. <f>ⓖ</f>You have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come, and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord GOD!
7-20 And what more can David say to you? <f>ⓗ</f>For you know your servant, O Lord GOD!
7-21 Because of your promise, and according to your own heart, you have brought about all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
7-22 <f>ⓘ</f> Therefore you are great, O LORD God. <f>ⓙ</f>For there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
7-23 <f>ⓚ</f> And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making himself a name <f>ⓛ</f>and doing for them <f>[4]</f> great and awesome things by driving out before your people, <f>[5]</f> whom <f>ⓜ</f>you redeemed for yourself from Egypt, a nation and its gods?
7-24 <f>ⓝ</f> And you established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever. And you, O LORD, became their God.
7-25 And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, and do as you have spoken.
7-26 And your name will be magnified forever, saying, ‘The LORD of hosts is God over Israel,’ and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
7-27 For you, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made this revelation to your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house.’ Therefore your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
7-28 And now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and <f>ⓞ</f>your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
7-29 Now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, O Lord GOD, have spoken, <f>ⓟ</f>and with your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever.”

7-1 <pb/>After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because <f>ⓐ</f>the Jews <f>[1]</f> were seeking to kill him.
7-2 Now <f>ⓑ</f>the Jews' Feast of <f>ⓒ</f>Booths was at hand.
7-3 <f>ⓓ</f> So his brothers <f>[2]</f> said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing.
7-4 For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, <f>ⓔ</f>show yourself to the world.”
7-5 <f>ⓕ</f> For not even <f>ⓖ</f>his brothers believed in him.
7-6 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</J>
7-7 <J>The world cannot hate you, but <f>ⓘ</f>it hates me because I testify about it that <f>ⓙ</f>its works are evil.</J>
7-8 <J>You go up to the feast. I am not <f>[3]</f> going up to this feast, for <f>ⓚ</f>my time has not yet fully come.”</J>
7-9 After saying this, he remained in Galilee.
7-10 <pb/>But after <f>ⓛ</f>his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private.
7-11 <f>ⓜ</f> The Jews <f>ⓝ</f>were looking for him at the feast, and saying, “Where is he?”
7-12 And there was much <f>ⓞ</f>muttering about him among the people. <f>ⓟ</f>While some said, “He is a good man,” others said, “No, <f>ⓠ</f>he is leading the people astray.”
7-13 Yet <f>ⓡ</f>for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.
7-14 <pb/>About the middle of the feast Jesus went up <f>ⓢ</f>into the temple and began teaching.
7-15 The Jews therefore <f>ⓣ</f>marveled, saying, “How is it that this man has learning, <f>[4]</f> when he has never studied?”
7-16 So Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“My teaching is not mine, but his <f>ⓥ</f>who sent me.</J>
7-17 <J><f>ⓦ</f> If anyone's will is to do God's <f>[5]</f> will, <f>ⓧ</f>he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I <f>ⓨ</f>am speaking on my own authority.</J>
7-18 <J>The one who speaks on his own authority <f>ⓩ</f>seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</J>
7-19 <J><f>ⓐ</f> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. <f>ⓑ</f>Why do you seek to kill me?”</J>
7-20 The crowd answered, <f>ⓒ</f>“You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?”
7-21 Jesus answered them, <J>“I did <f>ⓓ</f>one work, and you all marvel at it.</J>
7-22 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but <f>ⓕ</f>from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</J>
7-23 <J>If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, <f>ⓖ</f>are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</J>
7-24 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.”</J>
7-25 <pb/>Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, “Is not this the man whom <f>ⓘ</f>they seek to kill?
7-26 And here he is, <f>ⓙ</f>speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that <f>ⓚ</f>the authorities really know that this is the Christ?
7-27 But <f>ⓛ</f>we know <f>ⓜ</f>where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, <f>ⓝ</f>no one will know where he comes from.”
7-28 So Jesus proclaimed, <f>ⓞ</f>as he taught in the temple, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“You know me, and you know where I come from. But <f>ⓠ</f>I have not come of my own accord. <f>ⓡ</f>He who sent me is true, <f>ⓢ</f>and him you do not know.</J>
7-29 <J><f>ⓣ</f> I know him, for I come <f>ⓤ</f>from him, and <f>ⓥ</f>he sent me.”</J>
7-30 <f>ⓦ</f> So they were seeking to arrest him, but <f>ⓧ</f>no one laid a hand on him, <f>ⓨ</f>because his hour had not yet come.
7-31 Yet <f>ⓩ</f>many of the people believed in him. They said, <f>ⓐ</f>“When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?”
7-32 <pb/>The Pharisees heard the crowd <f>ⓑ</f>muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent <f>ⓒ</f>officers to arrest him.
7-33 Jesus then said, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“I will be with you a little longer, and then <f>ⓔ</f>I am going to him who sent me.</J>
7-34 <J><f>ⓕ</f> You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come.”</J>
7-35 The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? <f>ⓖ</f>Does he intend to go to <f>ⓗ</f>the Dispersion among <f>ⓘ</f>the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
7-36 What does he mean by saying, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>‘You will seek me and you will not find me,’</J> and, <J>‘Where I am you cannot come’</J>?”
7-37 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“If anyone thirsts, let him <f>ⓜ</f>come to me and drink.</J>
7-38 <J>Whoever believes in me, <f>ⓝ</f>as <f>[6]</f> the Scripture has said, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of <f>ⓟ</f>living water.’”</J>
7-39 Now <f>ⓠ</f>this he said about the Spirit, <f>ⓡ</f>whom those who believed in him were to receive, <f>ⓢ</f>for as yet the Spirit had not been <f>ⓣ</f>given, <f>ⓤ</f>because Jesus was not yet glorified.
7-40 <pb/>When they heard these words, <f>ⓥ</f>some of the people said, “This really is <f>ⓦ</f>the Prophet.”
7-41 Others said, “This is <f>ⓧ</f>the Christ.” But some said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Is the Christ to come from Galilee?
7-42 Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes <f>ⓩ</f>from the offspring of David, and comes <f>ⓐ</f>from Bethlehem, the village <f>ⓑ</f>where David was?”
7-43 So there was <f>ⓒ</f>a division among the people over him.
7-44 <f>ⓓ</f> Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.
7-45 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why did you not bring him?”
7-46 The officers answered, <f>ⓕ</f>“No one ever spoke like this man!”
7-47 The Pharisees answered them, <f>ⓖ</f>“Have you also been deceived?
7-48 <f>ⓗ</f> Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him?
7-49 But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.”
7-50 <f>ⓘ</f> Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them,
7-51 <f>ⓙ</f> “Does our law judge a man without first <f>ⓚ</f>giving him a hearing and learning what he does?”
7-52 They replied, <f>ⓛ</f>“Are you from Galilee too? Search and see that <f>ⓜ</f>no prophet arises from Galilee.”
