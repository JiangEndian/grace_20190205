19-1 <pb/>On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they <f>ⓐ</f>came into the wilderness of Sinai.
19-2 They set out from <f>ⓑ</f>Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before <f>ⓒ</f>the mountain,
19-3 while <f>ⓓ</f>Moses went up to God. <f>ⓔ</f>The LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel:
19-4 <f>ⓕ</f> ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how <f>ⓖ</f>I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
19-5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be <f>ⓗ</f>my treasured possession among all peoples, for <f>ⓘ</f>all the earth is mine;
19-6 and you shall be to me a <f>ⓙ</f>kingdom of priests and <f>ⓚ</f>a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.”
19-7 <pb/>So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him.
19-8 <f>ⓛ</f> All the people answered together and said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do.” And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.
19-9 And the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I am coming to you <f>ⓜ</f>in a thick cloud, that <f>ⓝ</f>the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also <f>ⓞ</f>believe you forever.” <pb/>When Moses told the words of the people to the LORD,
19-10 the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and <f>ⓟ</f>consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them <f>ⓠ</f>wash their garments
19-11 and be ready for the third day. For on the third day <f>ⓡ</f>the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
19-12 And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, ‘Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. <f>ⓢ</f>Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death.
19-13 No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; <f>[1]</f> whether beast or man, he shall not live.’ When <f>ⓣ</f>the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.”
19-14 So Moses <f>ⓤ</f>went down from the mountain to the people and <f>ⓥ</f>consecrated the people; <f>ⓦ</f>and they washed their garments.
19-15 And he said to the people, “Be ready for the <f>ⓧ</f>third day; <f>ⓨ</f>do not go near a woman.”
19-16 <pb/>On the morning of the <f>ⓩ</f>third day there were <f>ⓐ</f>thunders and lightnings and <f>ⓑ</f>a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud <f>ⓒ</f>trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp <f>ⓓ</f>trembled.
19-17 Then <f>ⓔ</f>Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain.
19-18 Now <f>ⓕ</f>Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and <f>ⓖ</f>the whole mountain trembled greatly.
19-19 And as the <f>ⓗ</f>sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and <f>ⓘ</f>God answered him in thunder.
19-20 The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
19-21 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD <f>ⓙ</f>to look and many of them perish.
19-22 Also let the priests who come near to the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>consecrate themselves, lest the LORD <f>ⓛ</f>break out against them.”
19-23 And Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>‘Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.’”
19-24 And the LORD said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people <f>ⓝ</f>break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them.”
19-25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
8-1 <pb/>On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, <f>ⓐ</f>the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told <f>ⓑ</f>what he was to her.
8-2 <f>ⓒ</f> And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
8-3 <pb/>Then Esther spoke again to the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman <f>ⓓ</f>the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews.
8-4 <f>ⓔ</f> When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther, Esther rose and stood before the king.
8-5 And she said, “If it please the king, <f>ⓕ</f>and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the thing seems right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to revoke <f>ⓖ</f>the letters devised by Haman <f>ⓗ</f>the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king.
8-6 For how can I bear <f>ⓘ</f>to see the calamity that is coming to my people? Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?”
8-7 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, <f>[1]</f> because he intended to lay hands on the Jews.
8-8 But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, <f>ⓚ</f>and seal it with the king's ring, for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's ring <f>ⓛ</f>cannot be revoked.”
8-9 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> The king's scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day. And an edict was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, to <f>ⓝ</f>the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces <f>ⓞ</f>from India to Ethiopia, <f>ⓟ</f>127 provinces, <f>ⓠ</f>to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language.
8-10 <f>ⓡ</f> And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus <f>ⓢ</f>and sealed it with the king's signet ring. Then he sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on <f>ⓣ</f>swift horses that were used in the king's service, bred from the royal stud,
8-11 saying that the king allowed the Jews who were in every city <f>ⓤ</f>to gather and defend their lives, <f>ⓥ</f>to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, children and women included, <f>ⓦ</f>and to plunder their goods,
8-12 <f>ⓧ</f> on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
8-13 <f>ⓨ</f> A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, being publicly displayed to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies.
8-14 So the couriers, mounted on their <f>ⓩ</f>swift horses that were used in the king's service, rode out hurriedly, urged by the king's command. And the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.
8-15 <pb/>Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king <f>ⓐ</f>in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓑ</f>a robe of fine linen and purple, <f>ⓒ</f>and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.
8-16 The Jews had <f>ⓓ</f>light and gladness and joy and honor.
8-17 And in every province and in every city, wherever the king's command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and <f>ⓔ</f>a holiday. <f>ⓕ</f>And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, <f>ⓖ</f>for fear of the Jews had fallen on them.
2-1 <pb/><t>How the Lord in his anger </t><t>has set the daughter of Zion <f>ⓐ</f>under a cloud! </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>He has cast down from heaven to earth </t><t>the splendor of Israel; </t><t>he has not remembered <f>ⓒ</f>his footstool </t><t>in the day of his anger. </t>
2-2 <pb/><t>The Lord <f>ⓓ</f>has swallowed up <f>ⓔ</f>without mercy </t><t>all the habitations of Jacob; </t><t>in his wrath <f>ⓕ</f>he has broken down </t><t>the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; </t><t>he has brought <f>ⓖ</f>down to the ground <f>ⓗ</f>in dishonor </t><t>the kingdom <f>ⓘ</f>and its rulers. </t>
2-3 <pb/><t>He has cut down in <f>ⓙ</f>fierce anger </t><t>all <f>ⓚ</f>the might of Israel; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>he has withdrawn from them his right hand </t><t>in the face of the enemy; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>he has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob, </t><t>consuming all around. </t>
2-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> He has bent his bow like an enemy, </t><t>with his right hand set <f>ⓞ</f>like a foe; </t><t>and he has killed all who were delightful in our eyes </t><t>in the tent of the daughter of Zion; </t><t>he has poured out his fury like fire. </t>
2-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> The Lord has become like an enemy; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>he has swallowed up Israel; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>he has swallowed up all its palaces; </t><t>he has laid in ruins its strongholds, </t><t>and he has multiplied in the daughter of Judah </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>mourning and lamentation. </t>
2-6 <pb/><t>He has laid waste his booth like a garden, </t><t>laid in ruins <f>ⓣ</f>his meeting place; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>the LORD has made Zion forget </t><t>festival and <f>ⓥ</f>Sabbath, </t><t>and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest. </t>
2-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> The Lord has scorned his altar, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>disowned his sanctuary; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>he has delivered into the hand of the enemy </t><t>the walls of her palaces; </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>they raised a clamor in the house of the LORD </t><t>as on the day of festival. </t>
2-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> The LORD determined to lay in ruins </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>the wall of the daughter of Zion; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>he stretched out the measuring line; </t><t>he did not restrain his hand from destroying; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>he caused rampart and wall to lament; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>they languished together. </t>
2-9 <pb/><t>Her gates have sunk into the ground; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>he has ruined <f>ⓖ</f>and broken her bars; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>her king and princes are among the nations; </t><t>the law is no more, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>her prophets find </t><t>no vision from the LORD. </t>
2-10 <pb/><t>The elders of the daughter of Zion </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>sit on the ground <f>ⓚ</f>in silence; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>they have thrown dust on their heads </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>put on sackcloth; </t><t>the young women of Jerusalem </t><t>have bowed their heads to the ground. </t>
2-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> My eyes are spent with weeping; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>my stomach churns; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>my bile is poured out to the ground </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>because infants and babies <f>ⓢ</f>faint </t><t>in the streets of the city. </t>
2-12 <pb/><t>They cry to their mothers, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>“Where is bread and wine?” </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>as they faint like a wounded man </t><t>in the streets of the city, </t><t>as their life is poured out </t><t>on their mothers' bosom. </t>
2-13 <pb/><t>What can I say for you, <f>ⓥ</f>to what compare you, </t><t>O daughter of Jerusalem? </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>What can I liken to you, that I may comfort you, </t><t>O virgin daughter of Zion? </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>For your ruin is vast as the sea; </t><t>who can heal you? </t>
2-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓨ</f> Your prophets have seen for you </t><t>false and deceptive visions; </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>they have not exposed your iniquity </t><t>to <f>ⓐ</f>restore your fortunes, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>but have seen for you <f>ⓒ</f>oracles </t><t>that are false and misleading. </t>
2-15 <pb/><t>All who pass along the way </t><t>clap their hands at you; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>they hiss and wag their heads </t><t>at the daughter of Jerusalem: </t><t>“Is this the city that was called </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>the perfection of beauty, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the joy of all the earth?” </t>
2-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> All your enemies </t><t>rail against you; </t><t>they hiss, they gnash their teeth, </t><t>they cry: “We <f>ⓗ</f>have swallowed her! </t><t>Ah, this is the day we longed for; </t><t>now we have it; <f>ⓘ</f>we see it!” </t>
2-17 <pb/><t>The LORD has done what he purposed; </t><t>he has carried out <f>ⓙ</f>his word, </t><t>which he commanded <f>ⓚ</f>long ago; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>he has thrown down <f>ⓜ</f>without pity; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>he has made the enemy rejoice over you </t><t>and exalted the <f>ⓞ</f>might of your foes. </t>
2-18 <pb/><t>Their heart cried to the Lord. </t><t>O <f>ⓟ</f>wall of the daughter of Zion, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>let tears stream down like a torrent </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>day and night! </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>Give yourself no rest, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>your eyes no respite! </t>

2-22 <pb/><t>You summoned as if to <f>ⓖ</f>a festival day </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>my terrors on every side, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>and on the day of the anger of the LORD </t><t>no one escaped or survived; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>those whom I held and raised </t><t>my enemy destroyed. </t>
1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The elder to the elect lady and her children, <f>ⓑ</f>whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who <f>ⓒ</f>know <f>ⓓ</f>the truth,

1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.
1-4 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.
1-5 And now I ask you, dear lady — <f>ⓗ</f>not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning — <f>ⓘ</f>that we love one another.
1-6 And <f>ⓙ</f>this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just <f>ⓚ</f>as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.
1-7 For <f>ⓛ</f>many deceivers <f>ⓜ</f>have gone out into the world, <f>ⓝ</f>those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.
1-8 Watch yourselves, <f>ⓞ</f>so that you may not lose what we <f>[1]</f> have worked for, but <f>ⓟ</f>may win a full reward.
1-9 Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, <f>ⓠ</f>does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching <f>ⓡ</f>has both the Father and the Son.
1-10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, <f>ⓢ</f>do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,
1-11 for whoever greets him <f>ⓣ</f>takes part in his wicked works.
