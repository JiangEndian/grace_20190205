24-1 <pb/>Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel <f>ⓐ</f>to Shechem and <f>ⓑ</f>summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel. And <f>ⓒ</f>they presented themselves before God.
24-2 And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Long ago, <f>ⓓ</f>your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, <f>[1]</f> Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and <f>ⓔ</f>they served other gods.
24-3 <f>ⓕ</f> Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. <f>ⓗ</f>I gave him Isaac.
24-4 And to Isaac I gave <f>ⓘ</f>Jacob and Esau. <f>ⓙ</f>And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, <f>ⓚ</f>but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
24-5 <f>ⓛ</f> And I sent Moses and Aaron, <f>ⓜ</f>and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it, and <f>ⓝ</f>afterward I brought you out.
24-6 <pb/>“‘Then <f>ⓞ</f>I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and <f>ⓟ</f>you came to the sea. <f>ⓠ</f>And the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
24-7 <f>ⓡ</f> And when they cried to the LORD, <f>ⓢ</f>he put darkness between you and the Egyptians <f>ⓣ</f>and made the sea come upon them and cover them; <f>ⓤ</f>and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. <f>ⓥ</f>And you lived in the wilderness a long time.
24-8 Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan. <f>ⓦ</f>They fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.
24-9 <f>ⓧ</f> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. <f>ⓨ</f>And he sent and invited Balaam the son of Beor to curse you,
24-10 <f>ⓩ</f> but I would not listen to Balaam. <f>ⓐ</f>Indeed, he blessed you. So I delivered you out of his hand.
24-11 <f>ⓑ</f> And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, <f>ⓒ</f>and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, and also <f>ⓓ</f>the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. And I gave them into your hand.
24-12 And I sent <f>ⓔ</f>the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was <f>ⓕ</f>not by your sword or by your bow.
24-13 I gave you a land on which you had not labored <f>ⓖ</f>and cities that you had not built, and you dwell in them. You eat the fruit of vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant.’
24-14 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> “Now therefore fear the LORD and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness. <f>ⓘ</f>Put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
24-15 <f>ⓙ</f> And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the LORD, <f>ⓚ</f>choose this day whom you will serve, whether <f>ⓛ</f>the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or <f>ⓜ</f>the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. <f>ⓝ</f>But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”
24-16 <pb/>Then the people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods,
24-17 for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
24-18 And the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God.”
24-19 <pb/>But Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the LORD, for he is <f>ⓞ</f>a holy God. He is <f>ⓟ</f>a jealous God; <f>ⓠ</f>he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.
24-20 <f>ⓡ</f> If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then <f>ⓢ</f>he will turn and do you harm and consume you, after having done you good.”
24-21 And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the LORD.”
24-22 Then Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that <f>ⓣ</f>you have chosen the LORD, to serve him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”
24-23 He said, “Then <f>ⓤ</f>put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD, the God of Israel.”
24-24 And the people said to Joshua, “The LORD our God we will serve, and his voice we will obey.”
24-25 So Joshua <f>ⓥ</f>made a covenant with the people that day, and put in place <f>ⓦ</f>statutes and rules for them at Shechem.
24-26 And Joshua <f>ⓧ</f>wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And <f>ⓨ</f>he took a large stone and set it up there <f>ⓩ</f>under the terebinth that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
24-27 And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, <f>ⓐ</f>this stone shall be a witness against us, for <f>ⓑ</f>it has heard all the words of the LORD that he spoke to us. Therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God.”
24-28 So Joshua <f>ⓒ</f>sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
24-29 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being 110 years old.
24-30 And they buried him in his own inheritance at <f>ⓔ</f>Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.
24-31 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua <f>ⓖ</f>and had known all the work that the LORD did for Israel.
24-32 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> As for the bones of Joseph, which the people of Israel brought up from Egypt, they buried them at Shechem, in the piece of land <f>ⓘ</f>that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money. <f>[3]</f> It became an inheritance of the descendants of Joseph.
24-33 <pb/>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died, and they buried him at Gibeah, the town of <f>ⓙ</f>Phinehas his son, which had been given him in <f>ⓚ</f>the hill country of Ephraim.
98-1 <pb/><t>Oh sing to the LORD <f>ⓐ</f>a new song, </t><t>for he has done <f>ⓑ</f>marvelous things! </t><t>His <f>ⓒ</f>right hand and his holy arm </t><t>have worked salvation for him.</t>
98-2 <t>The LORD has <f>ⓓ</f>made known his salvation; </t><t>he has <f>ⓔ</f>revealed his righteousness in <f>ⓕ</f>the sight of the nations.</t>
98-3 <t>He has <f>ⓖ</f>remembered his <f>ⓗ</f>steadfast love and faithfulness </t><t>to the house of Israel. </t><t>All <f>ⓘ</f>the ends of the earth have seen </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>the salvation of our God. </t>
98-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>break forth into joyous song and sing praises!</t>
98-5 <t>Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, </t><t>with the lyre and the <f>ⓜ</f>sound of melody!</t>
98-6 <t>With <f>ⓝ</f>trumpets and the sound of <f>ⓞ</f>the horn </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD! </t>
98-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> Let the sea roar, and <f>ⓡ</f>all that fills it; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>the world and those who dwell in it!</t>
98-8 <t>Let the rivers <f>ⓣ</f>clap their hands; </t><t>let <f>ⓤ</f>the hills sing for joy together</t>
98-9 <t>before the LORD, for he comes </t><t>to <f>ⓥ</f>judge the earth. </t><t>He will judge the world with righteousness, </t><t>and the peoples with equity. </t>
12-1 <pb/>At that time <f>ⓐ</f>Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and <f>ⓑ</f>they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
12-2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, <f>ⓒ</f>“Look, your disciples are doing <f>ⓓ</f>what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.”
12-3 He said to them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him:</J>
12-4 <J>how he entered the house of God and ate <f>ⓕ</f>the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</J>
12-5 <J>Or have you not read <f>ⓖ</f>in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?</J>
12-6 <J>I tell you, <f>ⓗ</f>something greater than the temple is here.</J>
12-7 <J>And if you had known <f>ⓘ</f>what this means, <f>ⓙ</f>‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless.</J>
12-8 <J>For <f>ⓚ</f>the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</J>
12-9 <pb/>He went on from there and <f>ⓛ</f>entered their synagogue.
12-10 And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, <f>ⓜ</f>“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” — <f>ⓝ</f>so that they might accuse him.
12-11 He said to them, <J>“Which one of you who has a sheep, <f>ⓞ</f>if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?</J>
12-12 <J><f>ⓟ</f> Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So <f>ⓠ</f>it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</J>
12-13 Then he said to the man, <J>“Stretch out your hand.”</J> And <f>ⓡ</f>the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other.
12-14 But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him.
12-15 <pb/>Jesus, aware of this, <f>ⓢ</f>withdrew from there. And <f>ⓣ</f>many followed him, and he healed them all
12-16 and <f>ⓤ</f>ordered them not to make him known.
12-17 <f>ⓥ</f> This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
12-18 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> “Behold, my <f>ⓧ</f>servant whom I have chosen, </t><t>my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>I will put my Spirit upon him, </t><t>and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.</t>
12-19 <t>He will not quarrel or cry aloud, </t><t>nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets;</t>
12-20 <t>a bruised reed he will not break, </t><t>and a smoldering wick he will not quench, </t><t>until he brings justice to victory;</t>
12-21 <t><f>ⓩ</f> and in his name the Gentiles will hope.” </t>
12-22 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw.
12-23 <f>ⓑ</f> And all the people were amazed, and said, <f>ⓒ</f>“Can this be the Son of David?”
12-24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, <f>ⓓ</f>“It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.”
12-25 <f>ⓔ</f> Knowing their thoughts, <f>ⓕ</f>he said to them, <J>“Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand.</J>
12-26 <J>And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</J>
12-27 <J>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, <f>ⓖ</f>by whom do <f>ⓗ</f>your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</J>
12-28 <J>But if it is <f>ⓘ</f>by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then <f>ⓙ</f>the kingdom of God has come upon you.</J>
12-29 <J>Or <f>ⓚ</f>how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed <f>ⓛ</f>he may plunder his house.</J>
12-30 <J><f>ⓜ</f> Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</J>
12-31 <J><f>ⓝ</f> Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but <f>ⓞ</f>the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</J>
12-32 <J>And whoever speaks a word <f>ⓟ</f>against the Son of Man <f>ⓠ</f>will be forgiven, but <f>ⓡ</f>whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in <f>ⓢ</f>this age or in the age to come.</J>
12-33 <pb/><J><f>ⓣ</f> “Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, <f>ⓤ</f>for the tree is known by its fruit.</J>
12-34 <J><f>ⓥ</f> You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, <f>ⓦ</f>when you are evil? <f>ⓧ</f>For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</J>
12-35 <J><f>ⓨ</f> The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.</J>
12-36 <J>I tell you, <f>ⓩ</f>on the day of judgment <f>ⓐ</f>people will give account for <f>ⓑ</f>every careless word they speak,</J>
12-37 <J>for <f>ⓒ</f>by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”</J>
12-38 <pb/>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, <f>ⓓ</f>we wish to see a sign from you.”
12-39 But he answered them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“An evil and <f>ⓕ</f>adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</J>
12-40 <J>For <f>ⓖ</f>just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, <f>ⓗ</f>so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</J>
12-41 <J><f>ⓘ</f> The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and <f>ⓙ</f>condemn it, for <f>ⓚ</f>they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, <f>ⓛ</f>something greater than Jonah is here.</J>
12-42 <J><f>ⓜ</f> The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, <f>ⓝ</f>something greater than Solomon is here.</J>
12-43 <pb/><J>“When <f>ⓞ</f>the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through <f>ⓟ</f>waterless places seeking rest, but finds none.</J>
12-44 <J>Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.</J>
12-45 <J>Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and <f>ⓠ</f>the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this <f>ⓡ</f>evil generation.”</J>
12-46 <pb/>While he was still speaking to the people, behold, <f>ⓢ</f>his mother and his <f>ⓣ</f>brothers <f>[1]</f> stood outside, asking to speak to him. <f>[2]</f>
12-47 
12-48 But he replied to the man who told him, <J>“Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”</J>
12-49 And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, <J>“Here are my mother and my brothers!</J>
12-50 <J>For <f>ⓤ</f>whoever <f>ⓥ</f>does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”</J>
