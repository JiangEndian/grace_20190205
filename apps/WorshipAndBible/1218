1 Kings 6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, <f>ⓑ</f>he began to build the house of the LORD.
1 Kings 6-2 <f>ⓒ</f> The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits <f>[1]</f> long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
1 Kings 6-3 The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house.
1 Kings 6-4 And <f>ⓓ</f>he made for the house windows with recessed frames. <f>[2]</f>
1 Kings 6-5 <f>ⓔ</f> He also built a structure <f>[3]</f> against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and <f>ⓕ</f>the inner sanctuary. And he made <f>ⓖ</f>side chambers all around.
1 Kings 6-6 The lowest story <f>[4]</f> was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.
1 Kings 6-7 <pb/>When the house was built, <f>ⓗ</f>it was with stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built.
1 Kings 6-8 <pb/>The entrance for the lowest <f>[5]</f> story was on the south side of the house, and one went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third.
1 Kings 6-9 <f>ⓘ</f> So he built the house and finished it, and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar.
1 Kings 6-10 He built the structure against the whole house, five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.
1 Kings 6-11 <pb/>Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon,
1 Kings 6-12 “Concerning this house that you are building, <f>ⓙ</f>if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, <f>ⓚ</f>which I spoke to David your father.
1 Kings 6-13 And <f>ⓛ</f>I will dwell among the children of Israel <f>ⓜ</f>and will not forsake my people Israel.”
1 Kings 6-14 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> So Solomon built the house and finished it.
1 Kings 6-15 He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood, <f>ⓞ</f>and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress.
1 Kings 6-16 <f>ⓟ</f> He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as <f>ⓠ</f>the Most Holy Place.
1 Kings 6-17 The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.
1 Kings 6-18 The cedar within the house was carved in the form of <f>ⓡ</f>gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen.
1 Kings 6-19 The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
1 Kings 6-20 The inner sanctuary <f>[6]</f> was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid <f>[7]</f> an altar of cedar.
1 Kings 6-21 And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.
1 Kings 6-22 And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. <f>ⓢ</f>Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.
1 Kings 6-23 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> In the inner sanctuary <f>ⓤ</f>he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.
1 Kings 6-24 Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.
1 Kings 6-25 The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form.
1 Kings 6-26 The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.
1 Kings 6-27 He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house. <f>ⓥ</f>And the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house.
1 Kings 6-28 And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings 6-29 <pb/>Around all the walls of the house he carved engraved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms.
1 Kings 6-30 The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms.
1 Kings 6-31 <pb/>For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided. <f>[8]</f>
1 Kings 6-32 He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. He overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.
1 Kings 6-33 <pb/>So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square,
1 Kings 6-34 and two doors of cypress wood. <f>ⓦ</f>The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
1 Kings 6-35 On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.
1 Kings 6-36 <f>ⓧ</f> He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.
1 Kings 6-37 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv.
1 Kings 6-38 And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it.
Ecclesiastes 3-1 <pb/>For everything there is a season, and <f>ⓐ</f>a time for every matter under heaven:
Ecclesiastes 3-2 <pb/><t>a time to be born, and a time to <f>ⓑ</f>die; </t><t>a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-3 <t>a time to kill, and a time to heal; </t><t>a time to break down, and a time to build up;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-4 <t>a time to <f>ⓒ</f>weep, and a time to laugh; </t><t>a time to mourn, and a time to <f>ⓓ</f>dance;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-5 <t>a time to <f>ⓔ</f>cast away stones, and a time to <f>ⓕ</f>gather stones together; </t><t>a time to embrace, and a time to <f>ⓖ</f>refrain from embracing;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-6 <t>a time to seek, and a time to <f>ⓗ</f>lose; </t><t>a time to keep, and a time to <f>ⓘ</f>cast away;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-7 <t>a time to <f>ⓙ</f>tear, and a time to sew; </t><t>a time to <f>ⓚ</f>keep silence, and a time to speak;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-8 <t>a time to love, and a time to <f>ⓛ</f>hate; </t><t>a time for war, and a time for peace. </t>
Ecclesiastes 3-9 <pb/>What <f>ⓜ</f>gain has the worker from his toil?
Ecclesiastes 3-10 I have seen <f>ⓝ</f>the business that <f>ⓞ</f>God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
Ecclesiastes 3-11 He has <f>ⓟ</f>made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot <f>ⓠ</f>find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
Ecclesiastes 3-12 I perceived that there is <f>ⓡ</f>nothing better for them than to be joyful and to <f>ⓢ</f>do good as long as they live;
Ecclesiastes 3-13 also <f>ⓣ</f>that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil — this is <f>ⓤ</f>God's gift to man.
Ecclesiastes 3-14 <pb/>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; <f>ⓥ</f>nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.
Ecclesiastes 3-15 That which is, <f>ⓦ</f>already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God <f>ⓧ</f>seeks what has been driven away. <f>[1]</f>
Ecclesiastes 3-16 <pb/>Moreover, <f>ⓨ</f>I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even <f>ⓩ</f>there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.
Ecclesiastes 3-17 I said in my heart, <f>ⓐ</f>God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is <f>ⓑ</f>a time for every matter and for every work.
Ecclesiastes 3-18 I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but <f>ⓒ</f>beasts.
Ecclesiastes 3-19 <f>ⓓ</f> For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity. <f>[2]</f>
Ecclesiastes 3-20 All go to one place. All are from <f>ⓔ</f>the dust, and to dust all return.
Ecclesiastes 3-21 Who knows whether <f>ⓕ</f>the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?
Ecclesiastes 3-22 So I saw that there is <f>ⓖ</f>nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for <f>ⓗ</f>that is his lot. Who can bring him to see <f>ⓘ</f>what will be after him?
Acts 9-1 <pb/>But Saul, <f>ⓐ</f>still <f>ⓑ</f>breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to <f>ⓒ</f>the high priest
Acts 9-2 and asked him for letters <f>ⓓ</f>to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to <f>ⓔ</f>the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
Acts 9-3 <f>ⓕ</f> Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.
Acts 9-4 And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, <J>“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting <f>ⓖ</f>me?”</J>
Acts 9-5 And he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, <J>“I am Jesus, <f>ⓗ</f>whom you are persecuting.</J>
Acts 9-6 <J>But <f>ⓘ</f>rise and enter the city, and you will be told <f>ⓙ</f>what you are to do.”</J>
Acts 9-7 <f>ⓚ</f> The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, <f>ⓛ</f>hearing the voice but seeing no one.
Acts 9-8 Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, <f>ⓜ</f>he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
Acts 9-9 And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
Acts 9-10 <pb/>Now there was a disciple at Damascus named <f>ⓝ</f>Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, <J>“Ananias.”</J> And he said, <f>ⓞ</f>“Here I am, Lord.”
Acts 9-11 And the Lord said to him, <J>“Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man <f>ⓟ</f>of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,</J>
Acts 9-12 <J>and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and <f>ⓠ</f>lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.”</J>
Acts 9-13 But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, <f>ⓡ</f>how much evil he has done to <f>ⓢ</f>your <f>ⓣ</f>saints at Jerusalem.
Acts 9-14 And here he has authority from <f>ⓤ</f>the chief priests to bind all who <f>ⓥ</f>call on your name.”
Acts 9-15 But the Lord said to him, <J>“Go, for <f>ⓦ</f>he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name <f>ⓧ</f>before the Gentiles and <f>ⓨ</f>kings and the children of Israel.</J>
Acts 9-16 <J>For <f>ⓩ</f>I will show him how much <f>ⓐ</f>he must suffer <f>ⓑ</f>for the sake of my name.”</J>
Acts 9-17 So <f>ⓒ</f>Ananias departed and entered the house. And <f>ⓓ</f>laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and <f>ⓔ</f>be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
Acts 9-18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and <f>ⓕ</f>he regained his sight. Then <f>ⓖ</f>he rose and was baptized;
Acts 9-19 and <f>ⓗ</f>taking food, he was strengthened. <pb/><e>Saul Proclaims Jesus in Synagogues</e> </pb> <pb/>For <f>ⓘ</f>some days he was with the disciples at Damascus.
Acts 9-20 And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>“He is the Son of God.”
Acts 9-21 And all who heard him were amazed and said, “Is not this the man who <f>ⓚ</f>made havoc <f>ⓛ</f>in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?”
Acts 9-22 But Saul <f>ⓜ</f>increased all the more in strength, and <f>ⓝ</f>confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving <f>ⓞ</f>that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts 9-23 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> When many days had passed, the Jews <f>[1]</f> plotted to kill him,
Acts 9-24 but their <f>ⓠ</f>plot became known to Saul. <f>ⓡ</f>They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him,
Acts 9-25 but his disciples took him by night and <f>ⓢ</f>let him down through an opening in the wall, <f>[2]</f> lowering him in a basket.
Acts 9-26 <pb/>And <f>ⓣ</f>when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
Acts 9-27 But <f>ⓤ</f>Barnabas took him and <f>ⓥ</f>brought him to the apostles and declared to them <f>ⓦ</f>how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and <f>ⓧ</f>how at Damascus he had <f>ⓨ</f>preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
Acts 9-28 So he went <f>ⓩ</f>in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord.
Acts 9-29 And he spoke and disputed against <f>ⓐ</f>the Hellenists. <f>[3]</f> But <f>ⓑ</f>they were seeking to kill him.
Acts 9-30 And when <f>ⓒ</f>the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off <f>ⓓ</f>to Tarsus.
Acts 9-31 <pb/>So <f>ⓔ</f>the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And <f>ⓕ</f>walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, <f>ⓖ</f>it multiplied.
Acts 9-32 <pb/>Now <f>ⓗ</f>as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
Acts 9-33 There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed.
Acts 9-34 And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, <f>ⓘ</f>Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.” And immediately he rose.
Acts 9-35 <f>ⓙ</f> And all the residents of Lydda and <f>ⓚ</f>Sharon saw him, and <f>ⓛ</f>they turned to the Lord.
Acts 9-36 <pb/>Now there was in <f>ⓜ</f>Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. <f>[4]</f> She was full of <f>ⓝ</f>good works and acts of charity.
Acts 9-37 In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in <f>ⓞ</f>an upper room.
Acts 9-38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, <f>ⓟ</f>“Please come to us without delay.”
Acts 9-39 So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to <f>ⓠ</f>the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics <f>[5]</f> and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.
Acts 9-40 But Peter <f>ⓡ</f>put them all outside, and <f>ⓢ</f>knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body <f>ⓣ</f>he said, “Tabitha, arise.” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.
Acts 9-41 And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then, calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
Acts 9-42 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and <f>ⓤ</f>many believed in the Lord.
Acts 9-43 And he stayed in Joppa for many days <f>ⓥ</f>with one Simon, a tanner.
