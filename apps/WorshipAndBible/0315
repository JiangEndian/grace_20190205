Genesis 19-1 <pb/>The <f>ⓐ</f>two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth
Genesis 19-2 and said, “My lords, <f>ⓑ</f>please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night <f>ⓒ</f>and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.” They said, <f>ⓓ</f>“No; we will spend the night in the town square.”
Genesis 19-3 But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
Genesis 19-4 <pb/>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house.
Genesis 19-5 <f>ⓔ</f> And they called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? <f>ⓕ</f>Bring them out to us, that we <f>ⓖ</f>may know them.”
Genesis 19-6 Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him,
Genesis 19-7 and said, “I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.
Genesis 19-8 <f>ⓗ</f> Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.”
Genesis 19-9 But they said, “Stand back!” And they said, “This fellow <f>ⓘ</f>came to sojourn, and <f>ⓙ</f>he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down.
Genesis 19-10 But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
Genesis 19-11 And they struck with <f>ⓚ</f>blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.
Genesis 19-12 <pb/>Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, <f>ⓛ</f>bring them out of the place.
Genesis 19-13 For we are about to destroy this place, <f>ⓜ</f>because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.”
Genesis 19-14 So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, <f>ⓝ</f>“Up! Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.
Genesis 19-15 <pb/>As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.”
Genesis 19-16 But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, <f>ⓞ</f>the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.
Genesis 19-17 And as they brought them out, one said, “Escape for your life. <f>ⓟ</f>Do not look back or stop anywhere in the <f>ⓠ</f>valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away.”
Genesis 19-18 And Lot said to them, “Oh, no, my lords.
Genesis 19-19 Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.
Genesis 19-20 Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there — is it not a little one? — and my life will be saved!”
Genesis 19-21 He said to him, “Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
Genesis 19-22 Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the city was called <f>ⓡ</f>Zoar. <f>[1]</f>
Genesis 19-23 <pb/>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
Genesis 19-24 Then <f>ⓢ</f>the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven.
Genesis 19-25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.
Genesis 19-26 But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back, and she became <f>ⓣ</f>a pillar of salt.
Genesis 19-27 <pb/>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had <f>ⓤ</f>stood before the LORD.
Genesis 19-28 And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
Genesis 19-29 <pb/>So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God <f>ⓥ</f>remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.
Genesis 19-30 <pb/>Now Lot went up out of Zoar and <f>ⓦ</f>lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.
Genesis 19-31 And the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
Genesis 19-32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.”
Genesis 19-33 So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
Genesis 19-34 <pb/>The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.”
Genesis 19-35 So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
Genesis 19-36 Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.
Genesis 19-37 The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓧ</f>He is the father of the Moabites to this day.
Genesis 19-38 The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓨ</f>He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
2 Chronicles 17-1 <pb/>Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place and strengthened himself against Israel.
2 Chronicles 17-2 He placed forces in all the <f>ⓐ</f>fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim <f>ⓑ</f>that Asa his father had captured.
2 Chronicles 17-3 The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals,
2 Chronicles 17-4 but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, <f>ⓒ</f>and not according to the practices of Israel.
2 Chronicles 17-5 Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah <f>ⓓ</f>brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, <f>ⓔ</f>and he had great riches and honor.
2 Chronicles 17-6 His heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD. And furthermore, <f>ⓕ</f>he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.
2 Chronicles 17-7 <pb/>In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, <f>ⓖ</f>to teach in the cities of Judah;
2 Chronicles 17-8 <f>ⓗ</f> and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
2 Chronicles 17-9 And <f>ⓘ</f>they taught in Judah, having the Book of the Law of the LORD with them. They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.
2 Chronicles 17-10 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
2 Chronicles 17-11 Some of the Philistines <f>ⓚ</f>brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute, and the Arabians also brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats.
2 Chronicles 17-12 And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built in Judah fortresses and store cities,
2 Chronicles 17-13 and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 17-14 This was the muster of them by fathers' houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 mighty men of valor;
2 Chronicles 17-15 and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;
2 Chronicles 17-16 and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, <f>ⓛ</f>a volunteer for the service of the LORD, with 200,000 mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles 17-17 Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, with 200,000 men <f>ⓜ</f>armed with bow and shield;
2 Chronicles 17-18 and next to him Jehozabad with 180,000 armed for war.
2 Chronicles 17-19 These were in the service of the king, besides <f>ⓝ</f>those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
Jeremiah 4-1 <pb/><t>“If you return, O Israel, <pb/>declares the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>to me you should return. </t><t>If you remove your detestable things from my presence, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>and do not waver,</t>
Jeremiah 4-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> and if you swear, ‘As the LORD lives,’ </t><t>in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, </t><t>then <f>ⓓ</f>nations shall bless themselves in him, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>and in him shall they glory.” </t>
Jeremiah 4-3 <pb/>For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f>“Break up your fallow ground, </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>sow not among thorns.</t>
Jeremiah 4-4 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD; </t><t>remove the foreskin of your hearts, </t><t>O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>lest my wrath go forth like fire, </t><t>and burn with none to quench it, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>because of the evil of your deeds.” </t>
Jeremiah 4-5 <pb/>Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“Blow the trumpet through the land; </t><t>cry aloud and say, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>‘Assemble, and let us go </t><t>into the fortified cities!’</t>
Jeremiah 4-6 <t><f>ⓜ</f> Raise a standard toward Zion, </t><t>flee for safety, stay not, </t><t>for I bring disaster from <f>ⓝ</f>the north, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and great destruction.</t>
Jeremiah 4-7 <t><f>ⓟ</f> A lion has gone up from his thicket, </t><t>a destroyer of nations has set out; </t><t>he has gone out from his place </t><t>to make your land a waste; </t><t>your cities will be ruins </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>without inhabitant.</t>
Jeremiah 4-8 <t>For this <f>ⓡ</f>put on sackcloth, </t><t>lament and wail, </t><t>for <f>ⓢ</f>the fierce anger of the LORD </t><t>has not turned back from us.” </t>
Jeremiah 4-9 <pb/>“In that day, declares the LORD, <f>ⓣ</f>courage shall fail both king and officials. The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded.”
Jeremiah 4-10 Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD, <f>ⓤ</f>surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It shall be well with you,’ whereas the sword has reached their very life.”
Jeremiah 4-11 <pb/>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from <f>ⓥ</f>the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse,
Jeremiah 4-12 a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who <f>ⓦ</f>speak in judgment upon them.”
Jeremiah 4-13 <pb/><t>Behold, he comes up like clouds; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>his chariots like the whirlwind; </t><t>his horses are <f>ⓨ</f>swifter than eagles — </t><t>woe to us, <f>ⓩ</f>for we are ruined!</t>
Jeremiah 4-14 <t>O Jerusalem, <f>ⓐ</f>wash your heart from evil, </t><t>that you may be saved. </t><t>How long shall your wicked thoughts </t><t>lodge within you?</t>
Jeremiah 4-15 <t>For a voice <f>ⓑ</f>declares from Dan </t><t>and proclaims trouble from <f>ⓒ</f>Mount Ephraim.</t>
Jeremiah 4-16 <t>Warn the nations that he is coming; </t><t>announce to Jerusalem, </t><t>“Besiegers come <f>ⓓ</f>from a distant land; </t><t>they shout against the cities of Judah.</t>
Jeremiah 4-17 <t>Like keepers of a field <f>ⓔ</f>are they against her all around, </t><t>because she has rebelled against me, <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 4-18 <t>Your ways and your deeds </t><t>have brought this upon you. </t><t>This is your doom, and <f>ⓕ</f>it is bitter; </t><t>it has reached your very heart.” </t>
Jeremiah 4-19 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! </t><t>Oh the walls of my heart! </t><t>My heart is beating wildly; </t><t>I cannot keep silent, </t><t>for I hear the sound of the trumpet, </t><t>the alarm of war.</t>
Jeremiah 4-20 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Crash follows hard on crash; </t><t>the whole land is laid waste. </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>Suddenly my tents are laid waste, </t><t>my curtains in a moment.</t>
Jeremiah 4-21 <t>How long must I see the standard </t><t>and hear the sound of the trumpet? </t>
Jeremiah 4-22 <pb/><t>“For <f>ⓙ</f>my people are foolish; </t><t>they know me not; </t><t>they are stupid children; </t><t>they have no understanding. </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>They are ‘wise’ — in doing evil! </t><t>But how to do good they know not.” </t>
Jeremiah 4-23 <pb/><t>I looked on the earth, and behold, it was <f>ⓛ</f>without form and void; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and to the heavens, and they had no light.</t>
Jeremiah 4-24 <t>I looked on <f>ⓝ</f>the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, </t><t>and all the hills moved to and fro.</t>
Jeremiah 4-25 <t><f>ⓞ</f> I looked, and behold, there was no man, </t><t>and all the birds of the air had fled.</t>
Jeremiah 4-26 <t>I looked, and behold, the <f>ⓟ</f>fruitful land was a desert, </t><t>and all its cities were laid in ruins </t><t>before the LORD, before <f>ⓠ</f>his fierce anger. </t>
Jeremiah 4-27 <pb/>For thus says the LORD, “The whole land shall be a desolation; <f>ⓡ</f>yet I will not make a full end.
Jeremiah 4-28 <pb/><t><f>ⓢ</f> “For this the earth shall mourn, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>and the heavens above be dark; </t><t>for I have spoken; I have purposed; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>I have not relented, nor will I turn back.” </t>
Jeremiah 4-29 <pb/><t>At the noise of horseman and archer </t><t>every city takes to flight; </t><t>they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; </t><t>all the cities are forsaken, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>no man dwells in them.</t>
Jeremiah 4-30 <t>And you, O desolate one, </t><t>what do you mean that you dress in scarlet, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>that you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>that you enlarge your eyes with paint? </t><t>In vain you beautify yourself. </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>Your lovers despise you; </t><t>they seek your life.</t>
Jeremiah 4-31 <t>For I heard <f>ⓩ</f>a cry as of a woman in labor, </t><t>anguish as of one giving birth to her first child, </t><t>the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>stretching out her hands, </t><t>“Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers.” </t>
1 Thessalonians 4-1 <pb/>Finally, then, brothers, <f>[1]</f> we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you <f>ⓐ</f>received from us <f>ⓑ</f>how you ought to walk and <f>ⓒ</f>to please God, just as you are doing, that you <f>ⓓ</f>do so more and more.
1 Thessalonians 4-2 For <f>ⓔ</f>you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians 4-3 For this is the will of God, <f>ⓕ</f>your sanctification: <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>that you abstain from sexual immorality;
1 Thessalonians 4-4 that each one of you know how to control his own <f>ⓗ</f>body <f>[3]</f> in holiness and <f>ⓘ</f>honor,
1 Thessalonians 4-5 not in <f>ⓙ</f>the passion of lust <f>ⓚ</f>like the Gentiles <f>ⓛ</f>who do not know God;
1 Thessalonians 4-6 that no one transgress and <f>ⓜ</f>wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is <f>ⓝ</f>an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you.
1 Thessalonians 4-7 For <f>ⓞ</f>God has not called us for <f>ⓟ</f>impurity, but in holiness.
1 Thessalonians 4-8 Therefore <f>ⓠ</f>whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, <f>ⓡ</f>who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
1 Thessalonians 4-9 <pb/>Now concerning <f>ⓢ</f>brotherly love <f>ⓣ</f>you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been <f>ⓤ</f>taught by God <f>ⓥ</f>to love one another,
1 Thessalonians 4-10 for that indeed is what <f>ⓦ</f>you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to <f>ⓧ</f>do this more and more,
1 Thessalonians 4-11 and to aspire <f>ⓨ</f>to live quietly, and <f>ⓩ</f>to mind your own affairs, and <f>ⓐ</f>to work with your hands, as we instructed you,
1 Thessalonians 4-12 so that you may <f>ⓑ</f>walk properly before <f>ⓒ</f>outsiders and be dependent on no one.
1 Thessalonians 4-13 <pb/>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, <f>ⓓ</f>that you may not grieve as others do <f>ⓔ</f>who have no hope.
1 Thessalonians 4-14 For <f>ⓕ</f>since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him <f>ⓖ</f>those who have fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians 4-15 For this we declare to you <f>ⓗ</f>by a word from the Lord, <f>[4]</f> that <f>ⓘ</f>we who are alive, who are left until <f>ⓙ</f>the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians 4-16 For <f>ⓚ</f>the Lord himself will descend <f>ⓛ</f>from heaven <f>ⓜ</f>with a cry of command, with the voice of <f>ⓝ</f>an archangel, and <f>ⓞ</f>with the sound of the trumpet of God. And <f>ⓟ</f>the dead in Christ will rise first.
1 Thessalonians 4-17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be <f>ⓠ</f>caught up together with them <f>ⓡ</f>in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so <f>ⓢ</f>we will always be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 4-18 Therefore encourage one another with these words.
