17-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
17-2 <f>ⓑ</f> Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you <f>ⓒ</f>test the LORD?”
17-3 But the people thirsted there for water, and <f>ⓓ</f>the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”
17-4 So Moses cried to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready <f>ⓔ</f>to stone me.”
17-5 And the LORD said to Moses, “Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with <f>ⓕ</f>which you struck the Nile, and go.
17-6 <f>ⓖ</f> Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.
17-7 And he called the name of the place <f>ⓗ</f>Massah <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓘ</f>Meribah, <f>[2]</f> because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”
17-8 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
17-9 So Moses said to <f>ⓚ</f>Joshua, “Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with <f>ⓛ</f>the staff of God in my hand.”
17-10 So <f>ⓜ</f>Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and <f>ⓝ</f>Hur went up to the top of the hill.
17-11 Whenever Moses <f>ⓞ</f>held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.
17-12 But Moses' hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and <f>ⓟ</f>Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
17-13 And <f>ⓠ</f>Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword.
17-14 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of <f>ⓡ</f>Joshua, that <f>ⓢ</f>I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”
17-15 And Moses <f>ⓣ</f>built an altar and called the name of it, The LORD Is My Banner,
17-16 saying, “A hand upon the throne <f>[3]</f> of the LORD! <f>ⓤ</f>The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”
6-1 <pb/>On that night the king could not sleep. And he gave orders to bring <f>ⓐ</f>the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
6-2 And it was found written how <f>ⓑ</f>Mordecai had told about <f>ⓒ</f>Bigthana <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓓ</f>Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
6-3 And the king said, “What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?” The king's young men who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.”
6-4 And the king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered <f>ⓔ</f>the outer court of the king's palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on <f>ⓕ</f>the gallows <f>[2]</f> that he had prepared for him.
6-5 And the king's young men told him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.” And the king said, “Let him come in.”
6-6 So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What should be done to the man <f>ⓖ</f>whom the king delights to honor?” And Haman said to himself, “Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?”
6-7 And Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor,
6-8 let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, <f>ⓗ</f>and the horse that the king has ridden, and on whose head <f>ⓘ</f>a royal crown <f>[3]</f> is set.
6-9 And let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble officials. Let them dress the man whom the king delights to honor, and let them lead him on the horse through the square of the city, <f>ⓙ</f>proclaiming before him: ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.’”
6-10 Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry; take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits <f>ⓚ</f>at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.”
6-11 So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he dressed Mordecai and led him through the square of the city, proclaiming before him, “Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.”
6-12 <pb/>Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning <f>ⓛ</f>and with his head covered.
6-13 And Haman told <f>ⓜ</f>his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him.”
6-14 <pb/>While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman <f>ⓝ</f>to the feast that Esther had prepared.
52-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
52-2 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
52-3 For because of the anger of the LORD it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. <pb/>And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
52-4 <f>ⓒ</f> And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks all around it.
52-5 So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
52-6 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
52-7 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, and the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
52-8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
52-9 Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
52-10 The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at <f>ⓓ</f>Riblah.
52-11 <f>ⓔ</f> He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison <f>ⓕ</f>till the day of his death.
52-12 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> In the fifth month, on <f>ⓗ</f>the tenth day of the month — that was <f>ⓘ</f>the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon — Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who <f>ⓙ</f>served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
52-13 And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
52-14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
52-15 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and <f>ⓚ</f>the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans.
52-16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
52-17 <pb/>And the <f>ⓛ</f>pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the <f>ⓜ</f>bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and <f>ⓝ</f>carried all the bronze to Babylon.
52-18 And they took away <f>ⓞ</f>the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the basins and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service;
52-19 <f>ⓟ</f> also the small bowls and the fire pans and the basins and the pots and <f>ⓠ</f>the lampstands and <f>ⓡ</f>the dishes for incense <f>ⓢ</f>and the bowls for drink offerings. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.
52-20 As for the two pillars, the one sea, <f>ⓣ</f>the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, <f>[1]</f> and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these things was beyond weight.
52-21 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow.
52-22 On it was a capital of bronze. The height of the one capital was <f>ⓥ</f>five cubits. A network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were around the capital. And the second pillar had the same, with pomegranates.
52-23 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network all around.
52-24 <pb/>And the captain of the guard took <f>ⓦ</f>Seraiah the chief priest, and <f>ⓧ</f>Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold;
52-25 and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and <f>ⓨ</f>seven men of the king's council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.
52-26 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at <f>ⓩ</f>Riblah.
52-27 And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at <f>ⓐ</f>Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.
52-28 <pb/>This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: <f>ⓑ</f>in the seventh year, 3,023 Judeans;
52-29 <f>ⓒ</f> in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem 832 persons;
52-30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Judeans 745 persons; all the persons were 4,600.
52-31 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, graciously freed <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.
52-32 And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of <f>ⓕ</f>the kings who were with him in Babylon.
52-33 So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table,
52-34 and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, according to his daily needs, until the day of his death, as long as he lived.
4-1 <pb/>Beloved, <f>ⓐ</f>do not believe every spirit, but <f>ⓑ</f>test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for <f>ⓒ</f>many <f>ⓓ</f>false prophets <f>ⓔ</f>have gone out into the world.
4-2 By this you know the Spirit of God: <f>ⓕ</f>every spirit that confesses that <f>ⓖ</f>Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
4-3 and every spirit <f>ⓗ</f>that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and <f>ⓘ</f>now is in the world already.
4-4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for <f>ⓙ</f>he who is in you is greater than <f>ⓚ</f>he who is in the world.
4-5 <f>ⓛ</f> They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and <f>ⓜ</f>the world listens to them.
4-6 We are from God. <f>ⓝ</f>Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know <f>ⓞ</f>the Spirit of truth and <f>ⓟ</f>the spirit of error.
4-7 <pb/>Beloved, <f>ⓠ</f>let us love one another, for love is from God, and <f>ⓡ</f>whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
4-8 <f>ⓢ</f> Anyone who does not love does not know God, because <f>ⓣ</f>God is love.
4-9 In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that <f>ⓤ</f>God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.
4-10 In this is love, <f>ⓥ</f>not that we have loved God <f>ⓦ</f>but that he loved us and sent his Son to be <f>ⓧ</f>the propitiation for our sins.
4-11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
4-12 <f>ⓨ</f> No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and <f>ⓩ</f>his love is perfected in us.
4-13 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
4-14 And <f>ⓑ</f>we have seen and testify that <f>ⓒ</f>the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of <f>ⓓ</f>the world.
4-15 <f>ⓔ</f> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
4-16 So <f>ⓕ</f>we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. <f>ⓖ</f>God is love, and <f>ⓗ</f>whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
4-17 By this <f>ⓘ</f>is love perfected with us, so that <f>ⓙ</f>we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because <f>ⓚ</f>as he is so also are we in this world.
4-18 There is no fear in love, but <f>ⓛ</f>perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not <f>ⓜ</f>been perfected in love.
4-19 <f>ⓝ</f> We love because he first loved us.
4-20 <f>ⓞ</f> If anyone says, “I love God,” and <f>ⓟ</f>hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot <f>[1]</f> love God <f>ⓠ</f>whom he has not seen.
4-21 And <f>ⓡ</f>this commandment we have from him: <f>ⓢ</f>whoever loves God must also love his brother.
