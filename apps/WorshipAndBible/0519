Exodus 34-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓐ</f>“Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, <f>ⓑ</f>and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, <f>ⓒ</f>which you broke.
Exodus 34-2 Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me <f>ⓓ</f>on the top of the mountain.
Exodus 34-3 No <f>ⓔ</f>one shall come up with you, and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain. Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain.”
Exodus 34-4 So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone.
Exodus 34-5 The LORD <f>ⓕ</f>descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and <f>ⓖ</f>proclaimed the name of the LORD.
Exodus 34-6 The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, <f>ⓗ</f>“The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and <f>ⓘ</f>gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast <f>ⓙ</f>love and faithfulness,
Exodus 34-7 <f>ⓚ</f> keeping steadfast love for thousands, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but <f>ⓜ</f>who will by no means clear the guilty, <f>ⓝ</f>visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.”
Exodus 34-8 And Moses quickly <f>ⓞ</f>bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
Exodus 34-9 And he said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please <f>ⓟ</f>let the Lord go in the midst of us, for <f>ⓠ</f>it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for <f>ⓡ</f>your inheritance.”
Exodus 34-10 <pb/>And he said, “Behold, <f>ⓢ</f>I am making a covenant. Before all your people <f>ⓣ</f>I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an <f>ⓤ</f>awesome thing that I will do with you.
Exodus 34-11 <pb/>“Observe what I command you this day. Behold, <f>ⓥ</f>I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Exodus 34-12 <f>ⓦ</f> Take care, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you go, lest it become a <f>ⓧ</f>snare in your midst.
Exodus 34-13 You shall <f>ⓨ</f>tear down their altars and <f>ⓩ</f>break their pillars and cut down their <f>ⓐ</f>Asherim
Exodus 34-14 (for <f>ⓑ</f>you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God),
Exodus 34-15 <f>ⓒ</f> lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and when they <f>ⓓ</f>whore after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and <f>ⓔ</f>you are invited, you eat of his sacrifice,
Exodus 34-16 and you take of <f>ⓕ</f>their daughters for your sons, and their daughters <f>ⓖ</f>whore after their gods and make your sons whore after their gods.
Exodus 34-17 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> “You shall not make for yourself any gods of cast metal.
Exodus 34-18 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> “You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in <f>ⓙ</f>the month Abib, for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.
Exodus 34-19 <f>ⓚ</f> All that open the womb are mine, all your male <f>[2]</f> livestock, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
Exodus 34-20 The <f>ⓛ</f>firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And <f>ⓜ</f>none shall appear before me empty-handed.
Exodus 34-21 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> “Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest. In plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
Exodus 34-22 <f>ⓞ</f> You shall observe the Feast of Weeks, the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year's end.
Exodus 34-23 <f>ⓟ</f> Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.
Exodus 34-24 For I will <f>ⓠ</f>cast out nations before you and <f>ⓡ</f>enlarge your borders; <f>ⓢ</f>no one shall covet your land, when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.
Exodus 34-25 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> “You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, <f>ⓤ</f>or let the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover remain until the morning.
Exodus 34-26 <f>ⓥ</f> The best of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. <f>ⓦ</f>You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.”
Exodus 34-27 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “Write these words, for in accordance with these words <f>ⓧ</f>I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
Exodus 34-28 <f>ⓨ</f> So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread nor drank water. And he <f>ⓩ</f>wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments. <f>[3]</f>
Exodus 34-29 <pb/>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with <f>ⓐ</f>the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face <f>ⓑ</f>shone because he had been talking with God. <f>[4]</f>
Exodus 34-30 Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face <f>ⓒ</f>shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
Exodus 34-31 But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them.
Exodus 34-32 Afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he <f>ⓓ</f>commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.
Exodus 34-33 And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a <f>ⓔ</f>veil over his face.
Exodus 34-34 <pb/>Whenever Moses <f>ⓕ</f>went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would remove the veil, until he came out. And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was commanded,
Exodus 34-35 the people of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face was <f>ⓖ</f>shining. And Moses would put the veil over his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

Ezekiel 12-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, you dwell in the midst of <f>ⓑ</f>a rebellious house, <f>ⓒ</f>who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not, for they are <f>ⓓ</f>a rebellious house.
Ezekiel 12-3 As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself <f>ⓔ</f>an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day <f>ⓕ</f>in their sight. You shall go like an exile from your place to another place <f>ⓖ</f>in their sight. <f>ⓗ</f>Perhaps they will understand, though <f>[1]</f> they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel 12-4 You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself <f>ⓘ</f>at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile.
Ezekiel 12-5 In their sight <f>ⓙ</f>dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it.
Ezekiel 12-6 In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you <f>ⓚ</f>a sign for the house of Israel.”
Ezekiel 12-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And I did as I was commanded. <f>ⓜ</f>I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage at dusk, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight.
Ezekiel 12-8 <pb/>In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-9 <f>ⓝ</f> “Son of man, has not the house of Israel, <f>ⓞ</f>the rebellious house, said to you, <f>ⓟ</f>‘What are you doing?’
Ezekiel 12-10 Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓠ</f>the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.’ <f>[3]</f>
Ezekiel 12-11 Say, <f>ⓡ</f>‘I am a sign for you: <f>ⓢ</f>as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.’
Ezekiel 12-12 <f>ⓣ</f> And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. <f>ⓤ</f>They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. <f>ⓥ</f>He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes.
Ezekiel 12-13 <f>ⓦ</f> And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And <f>ⓧ</f>I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, <f>ⓨ</f>yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there.
Ezekiel 12-14 <f>ⓩ</f> And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, <f>ⓐ</f>and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
Ezekiel 12-15 <f>ⓑ</f> And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
Ezekiel 12-16 <f>ⓒ</f> But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, <f>ⓓ</f>and may know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel 12-17 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-18 <f>ⓔ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓕ</f>eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with anxiety.
Ezekiel 12-19 And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: <f>ⓖ</f>They shall eat their bread with anxiety, <f>ⓗ</f>and drink water in dismay. In this way <f>ⓘ</f>her land will be stripped of all it contains, <f>ⓙ</f>on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
Ezekiel 12-20 <f>ⓚ</f> And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel 12-21 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-22 “Son of man, <f>ⓛ</f>what is this proverb that you <f>[4]</f> have about the land of Israel, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>‘The days grow long, and every vision comes to nothing’?
Ezekiel 12-23 Tell them therefore, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.’ But say to them, <f>ⓝ</f>The days are near, and the fulfillment <f>[5]</f> of every vision.
Ezekiel 12-24 <f>ⓞ</f> For there shall be no more any <f>ⓟ</f>false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel 12-25 For I am the LORD; I will speak <f>ⓠ</f>the word that I will speak, and it will be performed. <f>ⓡ</f>It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, <f>ⓢ</f>O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it, declares the Lord GOD.”
Ezekiel 12-26 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-27 “Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, <f>ⓣ</f>‘The vision that he sees is <f>ⓤ</f>for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.’
Ezekiel 12-28 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓥ</f>None of my words will be delayed any longer, <f>ⓦ</f>but the word that I speak will be performed, declares the Lord GOD.”
Revelation 13-1 <pb/>And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, <f>ⓐ</f>with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and <f>ⓑ</f>blasphemous names on its heads.
Revelation 13-2 And the beast that I saw was <f>ⓒ</f>like a leopard; its feet were like <f>ⓓ</f>a bear's, and its mouth was like <f>ⓔ</f>a lion's mouth. And to it <f>ⓕ</f>the dragon gave his power and <f>ⓖ</f>his throne and great authority.
Revelation 13-3 One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and <f>ⓗ</f>the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.
Revelation 13-4 And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, <f>ⓘ</f>“Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”
Revelation 13-5 <pb/>And the beast was given <f>ⓙ</f>a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for <f>ⓚ</f>forty-two months.
Revelation 13-6 It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, <f>[1]</f> that is, those who dwell in heaven.
Revelation 13-7 Also it was allowed <f>ⓛ</f>to make war on the saints and to conquer them. <f>[2]</f> And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation,
Revelation 13-8 and all <f>ⓜ</f>who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in <f>ⓝ</f>the book of life of <f>ⓞ</f>the Lamb <f>ⓟ</f>who was slain.
Revelation 13-9 <f>ⓠ</f> If anyone has an ear, let him hear:
Revelation 13-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f> If anyone is to be taken captive, </t><t>to captivity he goes; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>if anyone is to be slain with the sword, </t><t>with the sword must he be slain. </t> <pb/><f>ⓣ</f>Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.
Revelation 13-11 <pb/>Then <f>ⓤ</f>I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.
Revelation 13-12 It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, <f>[3]</f> and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, <f>ⓥ</f>whose mortal wound was healed.
Revelation 13-13 <f>ⓦ</f> It performs great signs, even <f>ⓧ</f>making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people,
Revelation 13-14 and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of <f>[4]</f> the beast <f>ⓨ</f>it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast <f>ⓩ</f>that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
Revelation 13-15 And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not <f>ⓐ</f>worship the image of the beast <f>ⓑ</f>to be slain.
Revelation 13-16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,
Revelation 13-17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, <f>ⓓ</f>the name of the beast or <f>ⓔ</f>the number of its name.
Revelation 13-18 <f>ⓕ</f> This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number <f>ⓖ</f>of a man, and his number is 666. <f>[6]</f>
