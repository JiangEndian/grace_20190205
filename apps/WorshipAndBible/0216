1 Chronicles 19-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place.
1 Chronicles 19-2 And David said, “I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt kindly with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him.
1 Chronicles 19-3 But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”
1 Chronicles 19-4 So Hanun took David's servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away;
1 Chronicles 19-5 and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.”
1 Chronicles 19-6 <pb/>When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents <f>[1]</f> of silver to hire chariots and horsemen <f>ⓑ</f>from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from <f>ⓒ</f>Zobah.
1 Chronicles 19-7 They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and encamped before <f>ⓓ</f>Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle.
1 Chronicles 19-8 When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.
1 Chronicles 19-9 And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
1 Chronicles 19-10 <pb/>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.
1 Chronicles 19-11 The rest of his men he put in the charge of <f>ⓔ</f>Abishai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles 19-12 And he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you.
1 Chronicles 19-13 Be strong, and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him.”
1 Chronicles 19-14 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle, and they fled before him.
1 Chronicles 19-15 And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before <f>ⓕ</f>Abishai, Joab's brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 19-16 <pb/>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, <f>[2]</f> with <f>ⓖ</f>Shophach the commander of the army of <f>ⓗ</f>Hadadezer at their head.
1 Chronicles 19-17 And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
1 Chronicles 19-18 And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of <f>ⓘ</f>7,000 chariots and 40,000 <f>ⓙ</f>foot soldiers, and put to death also <f>ⓚ</f>Shophach the commander of their army.
1 Chronicles 19-19 And when the servants of <f>ⓛ</f>Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to save the Ammonites anymore.
Isaiah 43-1 <pb/><t>But now thus says the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>he who created you, O Jacob, </t><t>he who formed you, O Israel: </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>“Fear not, for I have redeemed you; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>I have called you by name, you are mine.</t>

Isaiah 43-7 <t>everyone who is called by my name, </t><t>whom I created for my glory, </t><t>whom I formed and made.” </t>
Isaiah 43-8 <pb/><t>Bring out <f>ⓝ</f>the people who are blind, yet have eyes, </t><t>who are deaf, yet have ears!</t>

Isaiah 43-10 <t><f>ⓟ</f> “You are my witnesses,” declares the LORD, </t><t>“and <f>ⓠ</f>my servant whom I have chosen, </t><t>that you may know and believe me </t><t>and understand that I am he. </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>Before me no god was formed, </t><t>nor shall there be any after me.</t>

Isaiah 43-12 <t>I declared and saved and proclaimed, </t><t>when there was no strange god among you; </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>you are my witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and I am God.</t>

Isaiah 43-19 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Behold, I am doing a new thing; </t><t>now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>I will make a way in the wilderness </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>and rivers in the desert.</t>
Isaiah 43-20 <t>The wild beasts will honor me, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the jackals and the ostriches, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>for I give water in the wilderness, </t><t>rivers in the desert, </t><t>to give drink to my chosen people,</t>
Isaiah 43-21 <t>the people whom I formed for myself </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>that they might declare my praise. </t>
Isaiah 43-22 <pb/><t>“Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob; </t><t>but <f>ⓙ</f>you have been weary of me, O Israel!</t>
Isaiah 43-23 <t><f>ⓚ</f> You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings, </t><t>or honored me with your sacrifices. </t><t>I have not burdened you with offerings, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>or wearied you with frankincense.</t>
Isaiah 43-24 <t>You have not bought me sweet cane with money, </t><t>or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices. </t><t>But you have burdened me with your sins; </t><t>you have wearied me with your iniquities. </t>

2 Corinthians 9-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>it is superfluous for me to write to you about <f>ⓑ</f>the ministry for the saints,
2 Corinthians 9-2 for I know your readiness, <f>ⓒ</f>of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready <f>ⓓ</f>since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them.
2 Corinthians 9-3 But <f>ⓔ</f>I am sending <f>[1]</f> the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, <f>ⓕ</f>as I said you would be.
2 Corinthians 9-4 Otherwise, if some Macedonians <f>ⓖ</f>come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated — to say nothing of you — for being so confident.
2 Corinthians 9-5 So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the <f>ⓗ</f>gift <f>[2]</f> you have promised, so that it may be ready <f>ⓘ</f>as a willing gift, <f>ⓙ</f>not as an exaction. <f>[3]</f>
2 Corinthians 9-6 <pb/>The point is this: <f>ⓚ</f>whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully <f>[4]</f> will also reap bountifully.
2 Corinthians 9-7 Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, <f>ⓛ</f>not reluctantly or under compulsion, for <f>ⓜ</f>God loves a cheerful giver.
2 Corinthians 9-8 And <f>ⓝ</f>God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency <f>[5]</f> in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.
2 Corinthians 9-9 As it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>“He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; </t><t>his righteousness endures forever.” </t>
2 Corinthians 9-10 <pb/>He who supplies <f>ⓟ</f>seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and <f>ⓠ</f>increase the harvest of your righteousness.
2 Corinthians 9-11 <f>ⓡ</f> You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which <f>ⓢ</f>through us will produce thanksgiving to God.
2 Corinthians 9-12 For the ministry of this service is not only supplying <f>ⓣ</f>the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.
2 Corinthians 9-13 By their approval of this service, <f>ⓤ</f>they <f>[6]</f> will glorify God because of your submission that comes from your <f>ⓥ</f>confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others,
2 Corinthians 9-14 while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you.
2 Corinthians 9-15 <f>ⓦ</f> Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
