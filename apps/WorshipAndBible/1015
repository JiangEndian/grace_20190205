1-1 <pb/>In the days <f>ⓐ</f>when the judges ruled there was <f>ⓑ</f>a famine in the land, and a man of <f>ⓒ</f>Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
1-2 The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were <f>ⓓ</f>Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there.
1-3 But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons.
1-4 These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years,
1-5 and both Mahlon and Chilion died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.
1-6 <pb/>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD had visited his people and <f>ⓕ</f>given them food.
1-7 So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
1-8 But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother's house. May the LORD <f>ⓖ</f>deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with <f>ⓗ</f>the dead and with me.
1-9 The LORD grant that you may find <f>ⓘ</f>rest, each of you in the house of her husband!” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.
1-10 And they said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.”
1-11 But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb <f>ⓙ</f>that they may become your husbands?
1-12 Turn back, my daughters; go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons,
1-13 would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that <f>ⓚ</f>the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.”
1-14 Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
1-15 <pb/>And she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to <f>ⓛ</f>her gods; return after your sister-in-law.”
1-16 But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. <f>ⓜ</f>Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.
1-17 Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. <f>ⓝ</f>May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.”
1-18 <f>ⓞ</f> And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.
1-19 <pb/>So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, <f>ⓟ</f>the whole town was stirred because of them. And the women said, “Is this Naomi?”
1-20 She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; <f>[1]</f> call me <f>ⓠ</f>Mara, <f>[2]</f> for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
1-21 <f>ⓡ</f> I went away full, and the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi, when the LORD has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?”
1-22 <pb/>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem <f>ⓢ</f>at the beginning of barley harvest.
120-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> In my distress I called to the LORD, </t><t>and he answered me.</t>
120-2 <t>Deliver me, O LORD, </t><t>from lying lips, </t><t>from a deceitful tongue. </t>
120-3 <pb/><t>What shall be given to you, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>and what more shall be done to you, </t><t>you deceitful tongue?</t>
120-4 <t><f>ⓒ</f> A warrior's <f>ⓓ</f>sharp arrows, </t><t>with glowing <f>ⓔ</f>coals of the broom tree! </t>
120-5 <pb/><t>Woe to me, that I sojourn in <f>ⓕ</f>Meshech, </t><t>that I dwell among <f>ⓖ</f>the tents of <f>ⓗ</f>Kedar!</t>
120-6 <t>Too long have I had my dwelling </t><t>among those who hate peace.</t>
120-7 <t><f>ⓘ</f> I am for peace, </t><t>but when I speak, they are for war! </t>
6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> He went away from there and came to <f>ⓑ</f>his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
6-2 And <f>ⓒ</f>on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and <f>ⓓ</f>many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands?
6-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Is not this <f>ⓕ</f>the carpenter, the son of Mary and <f>ⓖ</f>brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And <f>ⓗ</f>they took offense at him.
6-4 And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.”</J>
6-5 And <f>ⓙ</f>he could do no mighty work there, except that <f>ⓚ</f>he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.
6-6 And <f>ⓛ</f>he marveled because of their unbelief. <pb/><f>ⓜ</f>And he went about among the villages teaching.
6-7 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
6-8 He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff — no bread, no bag, no money in their belts —
6-9 but to <f>ⓞ</f>wear sandals and not put on two tunics. <f>[1]</f>
6-10 And he said to them, <J>“Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.</J>
6-11 <J>And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, <f>ⓟ</f>shake off the dust that is on your feet <f>ⓠ</f>as a testimony against them.”</J>
6-12 <f>ⓡ</f> So they went out and <f>ⓢ</f>proclaimed <f>ⓣ</f>that people should repent.
6-13 <f>ⓤ</f> And they cast out many demons and <f>ⓥ</f>anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.
6-14 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' <f>[2]</f> name had become known. Some <f>[3]</f> said, <f>ⓧ</f>“John the Baptist <f>[4]</f> has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.”
6-15 <f>ⓨ</f> But others said, “He is Elijah.” And others said, “He is <f>ⓩ</f>a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”
6-16 But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”
6-17 <f>ⓐ</f> For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and <f>ⓑ</f>bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her.
6-18 <f>ⓒ</f> For John had been saying to Herod, <f>ⓓ</f>“It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.”
6-19 And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not,
6-20 for Herod <f>ⓔ</f>feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he <f>ⓕ</f>heard him gladly.
6-21 <pb/>But an opportunity came when Herod <f>ⓖ</f>on his birthday <f>ⓗ</f>gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
6-22 For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”
6-23 And he vowed to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, <f>ⓘ</f>up to half of my kingdom.”
6-24 And she went out and said to her mother, “For what should I ask?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.”
6-25 And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”
6-26 And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her.
6-27 And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's <f>[5]</f> head. He went and beheaded him in the prison
6-28 and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
6-29 When his <f>ⓙ</f>disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
6-30 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> <f>ⓛ</f>The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught.
6-31 And he said to them, <J>“Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.”</J> For many were coming and going, and <f>ⓜ</f>they had no leisure even to eat.
6-32 <f>ⓝ</f> And they went away in <f>ⓞ</f>the boat to a desolate place by themselves.
6-33 Now many saw them going and <f>ⓟ</f>recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
6-34 When he went ashore he <f>ⓠ</f>saw a great crowd, and <f>ⓡ</f>he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.
6-35 And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late.
6-36 <f>ⓢ</f> Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
6-37 But he answered them, <J> <f>ⓣ</f>“You give them something to eat.”</J> And <f>ⓤ</f>they said to him, <f>ⓥ</f>“Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii <f>[6]</f> worth of bread and give it to them to eat?”
6-38 And he said to them, <J>“How many loaves do you have? Go and see.”</J> And when they had found out, they said, <f>ⓦ</f>“Five, and two fish.”
6-39 Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
6-40 So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
6-41 And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he <f>ⓧ</f>looked up to heaven and <f>ⓨ</f>said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all.
6-42 And they all ate and were satisfied.
6-43 And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.
6-44 And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
6-45 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> Immediately he <f>ⓐ</f>made his disciples get into <f>ⓑ</f>the boat and go before him to the other side, <f>ⓒ</f>to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
6-46 And after he had taken leave of them, <f>ⓓ</f>he went up on the mountain to pray.
6-47 And when <f>ⓔ</f>evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land.
6-48 And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about <f>ⓕ</f>the fourth watch of the night <f>[7]</f> he came to them, walking on the sea. <f>ⓖ</f>He meant to pass by them,
6-49 but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out,
6-50 for they all saw him and <f>ⓗ</f>were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“Take heart; it is I. <f>ⓙ</f>Do not be afraid.”</J>
6-51 And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,
6-52 for <f>ⓚ</f>they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts <f>ⓛ</f>were hardened.
6-53 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> When they had crossed over, they came to land at <f>ⓝ</f>Gennesaret and moored to the shore.
6-54 And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately <f>ⓞ</f>recognized him
6-55 and ran about the whole region and began to bring <f>ⓟ</f>the sick people <f>ⓠ</f>on their beds to wherever they heard he was.
6-56 And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, <f>ⓡ</f>they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even <f>ⓢ</f>the fringe of his garment. And <f>ⓣ</f>as many as touched it were made well.
