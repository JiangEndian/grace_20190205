17-1 <pb/>There was a man of <f>ⓐ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
17-2 And he said to his mother, “The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, <f>ⓑ</f>“Blessed be my son by the LORD.”
17-3 And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, “I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make <f>ⓒ</f>a carved image and <f>ⓓ</f>a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.”
17-4 So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother <f>ⓔ</f>took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah.
17-5 And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made <f>ⓕ</f>an ephod and <f>ⓖ</f>household gods, and <f>ⓗ</f>ordained <f>[1]</f> one of his sons, who became his priest.
17-6 <f>ⓘ</f> In those days there was no king in Israel. <f>ⓙ</f>Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
17-7 <pb/>Now there was a young man of <f>ⓚ</f>Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
17-8 And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to <f>ⓛ</f>the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
17-9 And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place.”
17-10 And Micah said to him, “Stay with me, and be to me <f>ⓜ</f>a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living.” And the Levite went in.
17-11 And the Levite <f>ⓝ</f>was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
17-12 And Micah <f>ⓞ</f>ordained the Levite, and the young man <f>ⓟ</f>became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
17-13 Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest.”
115-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness! </t>
115-2 <pb/><t>Why should the nations say, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Where is their God?”</t>
115-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Our God is in the heavens; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>he does all that he pleases. </t>
115-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> Their idols are silver and gold, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the work of human hands.</t>
115-5 <t>They have mouths, <f>ⓗ</f>but do not speak; </t><t>eyes, but do not see.</t>
115-6 <t>They have ears, but do not hear; </t><t>noses, but do not smell.</t>
115-7 <t>They have hands, but do not feel; </t><t>feet, but do not walk; </t><t>and they do not make a sound in their throat.</t>
115-8 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Those who make them become like them; </t><t>so do all who trust in them. </t>
115-9 <pb/><t>O <f>ⓙ</f>Israel, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>trust in the LORD! </t><t>He is their <f>ⓛ</f>help and their shield.</t>
115-10 <t>O <f>ⓜ</f>house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! </t><t>He is their help and <f>ⓝ</f>their shield.</t>
115-11 <t>You <f>ⓞ</f>who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! </t><t>He is their help and their shield. </t>
115-12 <pb/><t>The LORD has remembered us; he will bless us; </t><t>he will bless <f>ⓟ</f>the house of Israel; </t><t>he will bless <f>ⓠ</f>the house of Aaron;</t>
115-13 <t>he will <f>ⓡ</f>bless those who fear the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>both the small and the great. </t>
115-14 <pb/><t>May the LORD <f>ⓣ</f>give you increase, </t><t>you and your children!</t>
115-15 <t>May <f>ⓤ</f>you be blessed by the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>who made heaven and earth! </t>
115-16 <pb/><t>The heavens are the LORD's heavens, </t><t>but the earth he has given to the children of man.</t>
115-17 <t><f>ⓦ</f> The dead do not praise the LORD, </t><t>nor do any who go down into <f>ⓧ</f>silence.</t>
115-18 <t>But <f>ⓨ</f>we will bless the LORD </t><t>from this time forth and forevermore. </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>Praise the LORD! </t>
1-1 <pb/>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, <f>ⓐ</f>the Son of God. <f>[1]</f>
1-2 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, <f>[2]</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Behold, I send my messenger before your face, </t><t>who will prepare your way,</t>
1-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> the voice of one crying in the wilderness: </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>‘Prepare <f>[3]</f> the way of the Lord, </t><t>make his paths straight,’” </t>
1-4 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> John appeared, baptizing in <f>ⓖ</f>the wilderness and proclaiming <f>ⓗ</f>a baptism of <f>ⓘ</f>repentance <f>ⓙ</f>for the forgiveness of sins.
1-5 And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, <f>ⓚ</f>confessing their sins.
1-6 Now John was <f>ⓛ</f>clothed with camel's hair and <f>ⓜ</f>wore a leather belt around his waist and ate <f>ⓝ</f>locusts and <f>ⓞ</f>wild honey.
1-7 And he preached, saying, <f>ⓟ</f>“After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
1-8 <f>ⓠ</f> I have baptized you with water, but <f>ⓡ</f>he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
1-9 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> In those days Jesus <f>ⓣ</f>came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
1-10 And when he came up out of the water, immediately he <f>ⓤ</f>saw <f>ⓥ</f>the heavens being torn open <f>ⓦ</f>and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
1-11 And <f>ⓧ</f>a voice came from heaven, <f>ⓨ</f>“You are my beloved Son; <f>[4]</f> with you I am well pleased.”
1-12 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
1-13 <f>ⓐ</f> And he was in the wilderness forty days, being <f>ⓑ</f>tempted by <f>ⓒ</f>Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and <f>ⓓ</f>the angels were ministering to him.
1-14 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Now after John was arrested, Jesus <f>ⓕ</f>came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,
1-15 and saying, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“The time is fulfilled, and <f>ⓗ</f>the kingdom of God is at hand; <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>repent and believe in the gospel.”</J>
1-16 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
1-17 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Follow me, and I will make you become <f>ⓚ</f>fishers of men.” <f>[6]</f></J>
1-18 And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
1-19 And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets.
1-20 And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.
1-21 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And they went into Capernaum, and immediately <f>ⓜ</f>on the Sabbath <f>ⓝ</f>he entered the synagogue and was teaching.
1-22 And <f>ⓞ</f>they were astonished at his teaching, <f>ⓟ</f>for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
1-23 And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,
1-24 <f>ⓠ</f> “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? <f>ⓡ</f>I know who you are — <f>ⓢ</f>the Holy One of God.”
1-25 But Jesus <f>ⓣ</f>rebuked him, saying, <J>“Be silent, and come out of him!”</J>
1-26 And the unclean spirit, <f>ⓤ</f>convulsing him and <f>ⓥ</f>crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.
1-27 And they were all <f>ⓦ</f>amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? <f>ⓧ</f>A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”
1-28 And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.
1-29 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> And immediately he <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
1-30 Now <f>ⓐ</f>Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
1-31 And he came and <f>ⓑ</f>took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
1-32 <pb/>That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or <f>ⓒ</f>oppressed by demons.
1-33 And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
1-34 <f>ⓓ</f> And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And <f>ⓔ</f>he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.
1-35 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and <f>ⓖ</f>there he prayed.
1-36 And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,
1-37 and they found him and said to him, <f>ⓗ</f>“Everyone is looking for you.”
1-38 And he said to them, <J>“Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for <f>ⓘ</f>that is why I came out.”</J>
1-39 <f>ⓙ</f> And <f>ⓚ</f>he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.
1-40 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And a leper <f>[8]</f> came to him, imploring him, and <f>ⓜ</f>kneeling said to him, <f>ⓝ</f>“If you will, you can make me clean.”
1-41 Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, <J>“I will; be clean.”</J>
1-42 And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.
1-43 And <f>ⓞ</f>Jesus <f>[9]</f> sternly charged him and sent him away at once,
1-44 and said to him, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, <f>ⓠ</f>show yourself to the priest and <f>ⓡ</f>offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, <f>ⓢ</f>for a proof to them.”</J>
1-45 <f>ⓣ</f> But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter <f>ⓤ</f>a town, but was out in <f>ⓥ</f>desolate places, and <f>ⓦ</f>people were coming to him from every quarter.
