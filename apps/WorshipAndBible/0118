15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, <f>ⓑ</f>Azariah the son of Amaziah, king of Judah, began to reign.
15-2 He was <f>ⓒ</f>sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
15-3 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
15-4 <f>ⓓ</f> Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places.
15-5 <f>ⓔ</f> And the LORD touched the king, so that he was a leper <f>[1]</f> to the day of his death, <f>ⓕ</f>and he lived in a separate house. <f>[2]</f> And Jotham the king's son was over the household, governing the people of the land.
15-6 Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
15-7 And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers <f>ⓖ</f>in the city of David, and Jotham his son reigned in his place.
15-8 <pb/>In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months.
15-9 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓗ</f>which he made Israel to sin.
15-10 Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him and <f>ⓘ</f>struck him down at Ibleam and put him to death and reigned in his place.
15-11 Now the rest of the deeds of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
15-12 (This was <f>ⓙ</f>the promise of the LORD that he gave to Jehu, “Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.” And so it came to pass.)
15-13 <pb/>Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of <f>ⓚ</f>Uzziah <f>[3]</f> king of Judah, and he reigned one month in <f>ⓛ</f>Samaria.
15-14 Then Menahem the son of Gadi came up from <f>ⓜ</f>Tirzah and came to Samaria, and he struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and put him to death and reigned in his place.
15-15 Now the rest of the deeds of Shallum, and the conspiracy that he made, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
15-16 At that time Menahem sacked Tiphsah and all who were in it and its territory from Tirzah on, because they did not open it to him. Therefore he sacked it, <f>ⓝ</f>and he ripped open all the women in it who were pregnant.
15-17 <pb/>In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel, and he reigned ten years in Samaria.
15-18 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart all his days from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin.
15-19 <f>ⓞ</f> Pul <f>[4]</f> the king of Assyria came against the land, and Menahem gave <f>ⓟ</f>Pul a thousand talents <f>[5]</f> of silver, that he might help him <f>ⓠ</f>to confirm his hold on the royal power.
15-20 Menahem exacted the money from Israel, that is, from all the wealthy men, fifty shekels <f>[6]</f> of silver from every man, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back and did not stay there in the land.
15-21 Now the rest of the deeds of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
15-22 And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah his son reigned in his place.
15-23 <pb/>In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years.
15-24 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓡ</f>which he made Israel to sin.
15-25 And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him with fifty men of the people of Gilead, and struck him down in Samaria, in the citadel of the king's house with Argob and Arieh; he put him to death and reigned in his place.
15-26 Now the rest of the deeds of Pekahiah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
15-27 <pb/>In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years.
15-28 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓢ</f>which he made Israel to sin.
15-29 <pb/>In the days of Pekah king of Israel, <f>ⓣ</f>Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured <f>ⓤ</f>Ijon, <f>ⓥ</f>Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, <f>ⓦ</f>Kedesh, <f>ⓧ</f>Hazor, Gilead, and <f>ⓨ</f>Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and he carried the people captive to Assyria.
15-30 Then Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah and struck him down and put him to death and reigned in his place, <f>ⓩ</f>in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
15-31 Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
15-32 <pb/>In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign.
15-33 He was <f>ⓐ</f>twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
15-34 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
15-35 <f>ⓒ</f> Nevertheless, the high places were not removed. The people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places. He built <f>ⓓ</f>the upper gate of the house of the LORD.
15-36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
15-37 In those days the LORD began to send <f>ⓔ</f>Rezin the king of Syria and <f>ⓕ</f>Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.
15-38 Jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob and will again choose Israel, and <f>ⓑ</f>will set them in their own land, and <f>ⓒ</f>sojourners will join them and will attach themselves to the house of Jacob.
14-2 And <f>ⓓ</f>the peoples will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them in the LORD's land <f>ⓔ</f>as male and female slaves. <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>They will take captive those who were their captors, <f>ⓖ</f>and rule over those who oppressed them.
14-3 <pb/>When the LORD has given you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard service with which you were made to serve,
14-4 you will take up this <f>ⓗ</f>taunt against the king of Babylon: <pb/><t>“How the oppressor has ceased, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>the insolent fury <f>[2]</f> ceased!</t>
14-5 <t>The LORD has broken the <f>ⓙ</f>staff of the wicked, </t><t>the <f>ⓚ</f>scepter of rulers,</t>
14-6 <t><f>ⓛ</f> that struck the peoples in wrath </t><t>with unceasing blows, </t><t>that ruled the nations in anger </t><t>with unrelenting persecution.</t>
14-7 <t>The whole earth is at rest and quiet; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>they break forth into singing.</t>
14-8 <t><f>ⓝ</f> <f>ⓞ</f>The cypresses rejoice at you, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>the cedars of Lebanon, saying, </t><t>‘Since you were laid low, </t><t>no woodcutter comes up against us.’</t>
14-9 <t>Sheol beneath is stirred up </t><t>to meet you when you come; </t><t>it rouses the shades to greet you, </t><t>all who were leaders of the earth; </t><t>it raises from their thrones </t><t>all who were kings of the nations.</t>
14-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> All of them will answer </t><t>and say to you: </t><t>‘You too have become as weak as we! </t><t>You have become like us!’</t>
14-11 <t>Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, </t><t>the sound of your harps; </t><t>maggots are laid as a bed beneath you, </t><t>and worms are your covers. </t>
14-12 <pb/><t>“How <f>ⓡ</f>you are fallen from heaven, </t><t>O Day Star, <f>ⓢ</f>son of Dawn! </t><t>How you are cut down to the ground, </t><t>you who laid the nations low!</t>
14-13 <t>You said in your heart, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>‘I will ascend to heaven; </t><t>above the stars of God </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>I will set my throne on high; </t><t>I will sit on the mount of assembly </t><t>in the far reaches of the north; <f>[3]</f></t>
14-14 <t>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; </t><t>I will make myself like the Most High.’</t>
14-15 <t><f>ⓥ</f> But you are brought down to Sheol, </t><t>to the far reaches of the pit.</t>
14-16 <t>Those who see you will stare at you </t><t>and ponder over you: </t><t>‘Is this <f>ⓦ</f>the man who made the earth tremble, </t><t>who shook kingdoms,</t>
14-17 <t>who made the world like a desert </t><t>and overthrew its cities, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>who did not let his prisoners go home?’</t>
14-18 <t>All the kings of the nations lie in glory, </t><t>each in his own tomb; <f>[4]</f></t>
14-19 <t>but you are cast out, away from your grave, </t><t>like a loathed branch, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>clothed with the slain, those pierced by the sword, </t><t>who go down to the stones of the pit, </t><t>like a dead body trampled underfoot.</t>
14-20 <t>You will not be joined with them in burial, </t><t>because you have destroyed your land, </t><t>you have slain your people. </t> <pb/><t>“May <f>ⓩ</f>the offspring of evildoers </t><t>nevermore be named!</t>
14-21 <t>Prepare slaughter for his sons </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>because of the guilt of their fathers, </t><t>lest they rise and possess the earth, </t><t>and fill the face of the world with cities.” </t>
14-22 <pb/>“I will rise up against them,” declares the LORD of hosts, “and will cut off from Babylon name and <f>ⓑ</f>remnant, <f>ⓒ</f>descendants and posterity,” declares the LORD.
14-23 “And I will make it a possession of the <f>ⓓ</f>hedgehog, <f>[5]</f> and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” declares the LORD of hosts.
14-24 <pb/><t>The LORD of hosts has sworn: </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>“As I have planned, </t><t>so shall it be, </t><t>and as I have purposed, </t><t>so shall it stand,</t>
14-25 <t>that <f>ⓕ</f>I will break the Assyrian in my land, </t><t>and on my mountains trample him underfoot; </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>his yoke shall depart from them, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>his burden from their shoulder.” </t>
14-26 <pb/><t>This is the purpose that is purposed </t><t>concerning the whole earth, </t><t>and this is <f>ⓘ</f>the hand that is stretched out </t><t>over all the nations.</t>
14-27 <t><f>ⓙ</f> For the LORD of hosts has purposed, </t><t>and who will annul it? </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>His hand is stretched out, </t><t>and who will turn it back? </t>
14-28 <pb/>In the year that <f>ⓛ</f>King Ahaz died came this <f>ⓜ</f>oracle:
14-29 <pb/><t>Rejoice not, <f>ⓝ</f>O Philistia, all of you, </t><t>that <f>ⓞ</f>the rod that struck you is broken, </t><t>for from the serpent's root will come forth an adder, </t><t>and its fruit will be a <f>ⓟ</f>flying fiery serpent.</t>
14-30 <t>And the firstborn of <f>ⓠ</f>the poor will graze, </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>the needy lie down in safety; </t><t>but I will kill your root with famine, </t><t>and your remnant it will slay.</t>
14-31 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Wail, O <f>ⓣ</f>gate; cry out, O city; </t><t>melt in fear, <f>ⓤ</f>O Philistia, all of you! </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>For smoke comes out of the north, </t><t>and there is no straggler in his ranks. </t>
14-32 <pb/><t>What will one answer the messengers of the nation? </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>“The LORD has founded Zion, </t><t>and in her the afflicted of his people find refuge.” </t>
12-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> I appeal to you therefore, brothers, <f>[1]</f> by the mercies of God, <f>ⓑ</f>to present your bodies <f>ⓒ</f>as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. <f>[2]</f>
12-2 <f>ⓓ</f> Do not be conformed to this world, <f>[3]</f> but be transformed by <f>ⓔ</f>the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may <f>ⓕ</f>discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. <f>[4]</f>
12-3 <pb/>For <f>ⓖ</f>by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you <f>ⓗ</f>not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, <f>ⓘ</f>each according to <f>ⓙ</f>the measure of faith that God has assigned.
12-4 For <f>ⓚ</f>as in one body we have many members, <f>[5]</f> and the members do not all have the same function,
12-5 so we, <f>ⓛ</f>though many, <f>ⓜ</f>are one body in Christ, and individually <f>ⓝ</f>members one of another.
12-6 <f>ⓞ</f> Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if <f>ⓟ</f>prophecy, <f>ⓠ</f>in proportion to our faith;
12-7 if <f>ⓡ</f>service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching;
12-8 the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; <f>ⓢ</f>the one who leads, <f>[6]</f> with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with <f>ⓣ</f>cheerfulness.
12-9 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Let love be genuine. <f>ⓥ</f>Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good.
12-10 <f>ⓦ</f> Love one another with brotherly affection. <f>ⓧ</f>Outdo one another in showing honor.
12-11 Do not be slothful in zeal, <f>ⓨ</f>be fervent in spirit, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>serve the Lord.
12-12 <f>ⓐ</f> Rejoice in hope, <f>ⓑ</f>be patient in tribulation, <f>ⓒ</f>be constant in prayer.
12-13 <f>ⓓ</f> Contribute to the needs of the saints and <f>ⓔ</f>seek to show hospitality.
12-14 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.
12-15 <f>ⓖ</f> Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
12-16 <f>ⓗ</f> Live in harmony with one another. <f>ⓘ</f>Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓙ</f>Never be wise in your own sight.
12-17 <f>ⓚ</f> Repay no one evil for evil, but <f>ⓛ</f>give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.
12-18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, <f>ⓜ</f>live peaceably with all.
12-19 Beloved, <f>ⓝ</f>never avenge yourselves, but leave it <f>[9]</f> to the wrath of God, for it is written, <f>ⓞ</f>“Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”
12-20 To the contrary, <f>ⓟ</f>“if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.”
12-21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
