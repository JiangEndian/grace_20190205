Genesis 37-1 <pb/>Jacob lived in <f>ⓐ</f>the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 37-2 <pb/>These are the generations of Jacob. <pb/>Joseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought <f>ⓑ</f>a bad report of them to their father.
Genesis 37-3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was <f>ⓒ</f>the son of his old age. And he made him <f>ⓓ</f>a robe of many colors. <f>[1]</f>
Genesis 37-4 But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.
Genesis 37-5 <pb/>Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more.
Genesis 37-6 He said to them, “Hear this dream that I have dreamed:
Genesis 37-7 Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, <f>ⓔ</f>my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and <f>ⓕ</f>bowed down to my sheaf.”
Genesis 37-8 His brothers said to him, “Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
Genesis 37-9 <pb/>Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, “Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
Genesis 37-10 But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and <f>ⓖ</f>your mother and your brothers indeed come <f>ⓗ</f>to bow ourselves to the ground before you?”
Genesis 37-11 And <f>ⓘ</f>his brothers were jealous of him, <f>ⓙ</f>but his father kept the saying in mind.
Genesis 37-12 <pb/>Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near <f>ⓚ</f>Shechem.
Genesis 37-13 And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.”
Genesis 37-14 So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word.” So he sent him from the Valley of <f>ⓛ</f>Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
Genesis 37-15 And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, “What are you seeking?”
Genesis 37-16 “I am seeking my brothers,” he said. “Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock.”
Genesis 37-17 And the man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to <f>ⓜ</f>Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at <f>ⓝ</f>Dothan.
Genesis 37-18 <pb/>They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them <f>ⓞ</f>they conspired against him to kill him.
Genesis 37-19 They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer.
Genesis 37-20 Come now, <f>ⓟ</f>let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. <f>[2]</f> Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams.”
Genesis 37-21 But when <f>ⓠ</f>Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.”
Genesis 37-22 And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him” — <f>ⓡ</f>that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father.
Genesis 37-23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, <f>ⓢ</f>the robe of many colors that he wore.
Genesis 37-24 And they took him and <f>ⓣ</f>threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.
Genesis 37-25 <pb/>Then they sat down to eat. And looking up they saw a <f>ⓤ</f>caravan of <f>ⓥ</f>Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing <f>ⓦ</f>gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.
Genesis 37-26 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it <f>ⓧ</f>if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
Genesis 37-27 Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and <f>ⓨ</f>let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers listened to him.
Genesis 37-28 Then <f>ⓩ</f>Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and <f>ⓐ</f>sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels <f>[3]</f> of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.
Genesis 37-29 <pb/>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he <f>ⓑ</f>tore his clothes
Genesis 37-30 and returned to his brothers and said, “The boy <f>ⓒ</f>is gone, and I, where shall I go?”
Genesis 37-31 Then they took <f>ⓓ</f>Joseph's robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
Genesis 37-32 And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, “This we have found; please identify whether it is your son's robe or not.”
Genesis 37-33 And he identified it and said, “It is my son's robe. <f>ⓔ</f>A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.”
Genesis 37-34 Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
Genesis 37-35 All his sons and all his daughters <f>ⓕ</f>rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “No, <f>ⓖ</f>I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” Thus his father wept for him.
Genesis 37-36 Meanwhile <f>ⓗ</f>the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, <f>ⓘ</f>the captain of the guard.
2 Chronicles 35-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Josiah kept a Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem. And they slaughtered the Passover lamb <f>ⓑ</f>on the fourteenth day of the first month.
2 Chronicles 35-2 He appointed the priests to their offices <f>ⓒ</f>and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 35-3 And he said to the Levites <f>ⓓ</f>who taught all Israel and who were holy to the LORD, “Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. You need not carry it on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles 35-4 Prepare yourselves <f>ⓔ</f>according to your fathers' houses by your divisions, <f>ⓕ</f>as prescribed in the writing of David king of Israel <f>ⓖ</f>and the document of Solomon his son.
2 Chronicles 35-5 And <f>ⓗ</f>stand in the Holy Place <f>ⓘ</f>according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of your brothers the lay people, and according to the division of the Levites by fathers' household.
2 Chronicles 35-6 And slaughter the Passover lamb, and <f>ⓙ</f>consecrate yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to the word of the LORD by <f>[1]</f> Moses.”
2 Chronicles 35-7 <pb/>Then Josiah contributed to the lay people, as Passover offerings for all who were present, lambs and young goats from the flock to the number of 30,000, and 3,000 bulls; <f>ⓚ</f>these were from the king's possessions.
2 Chronicles 35-8 And his officials contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. <f>ⓛ</f>Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2,600 Passover lambs and 300 bulls.
2 Chronicles 35-9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 bulls.
2 Chronicles 35-10 <pb/>When the service had been prepared for, the priests <f>ⓜ</f>stood in their place, <f>ⓝ</f>and the Levites in their divisions according to the king's command.
2 Chronicles 35-11 <f>ⓞ</f> And they slaughtered the Passover lamb, and the priests <f>ⓟ</f>threw the blood that they received from them <f>ⓠ</f>while the Levites flayed the sacrifices.
2 Chronicles 35-12 And they set aside the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of the lay people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the bulls.
2 Chronicles 35-13 <f>ⓡ</f> And they roasted the Passover lamb with fire according to the rule; and they <f>ⓢ</f>boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people.
2 Chronicles 35-14 And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
2 Chronicles 35-15 The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place <f>ⓣ</f>according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's <f>ⓤ</f>seer; <f>ⓥ</f>and the gatekeepers were at each gate. They did not need to depart from their service, for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.
2 Chronicles 35-16 <pb/>So all the service of the LORD was prepared that day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josiah.
2 Chronicles 35-17 And the people of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, <f>ⓦ</f>and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.
2 Chronicles 35-18 <f>ⓧ</f> No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as was kept by Josiah, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 35-19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.
2 Chronicles 35-20 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at <f>ⓩ</f>Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to meet him.
2 Chronicles 35-21 But he sent envoys to him, saying, “What have we to do with each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war. And God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you.”
2 Chronicles 35-22 Nevertheless, Josiah did not turn away from him, but <f>ⓐ</f>disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to fight in the plain of <f>ⓑ</f>Megiddo.
2 Chronicles 35-23 And the archers shot King Josiah. And the king said to his servants, <f>ⓒ</f>“Take me away, for I am badly wounded.”
2 Chronicles 35-24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. <f>ⓓ</f>All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
2 Chronicles 35-25 <f>ⓔ</f> Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah; and all <f>ⓕ</f>the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made these a rule in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments.
2 Chronicles 35-26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds according to what is written in the Law of the LORD,
2 Chronicles 35-27 and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
Jeremiah 22-1 <pb/>Thus says the LORD: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word,
Jeremiah 22-2 and say, <f>ⓐ</f>‘Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates.
Jeremiah 22-3 Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓑ</f>Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And <f>ⓒ</f>do no wrong or violence <f>ⓓ</f>to the resident alien, <f>ⓔ</f>the fatherless, and the widow, nor <f>ⓕ</f>shed innocent blood in this place.
Jeremiah 22-4 For if you will indeed obey this word, <f>ⓖ</f>then there shall enter the gates of this house kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants and their people.
Jeremiah 22-5 But if you will not obey these words, I <f>ⓗ</f>swear by myself, declares the LORD, that <f>ⓘ</f>this house shall become a desolation.
Jeremiah 22-6 For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah: <pb/><t>“‘You are like Gilead to me, </t><t>like the summit of <f>ⓙ</f>Lebanon, </t><t>yet surely I will make you a desert, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>an uninhabited city. <f>[1]</f></t>
Jeremiah 22-7 <t><f>ⓛ</f> I will prepare destroyers against you, </t><t>each with his weapons, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and they shall cut down your choicest cedars </t><t>and cast them into the fire. </t>
Jeremiah 22-8 <pb/>“‘And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, <f>ⓝ</f>“Why has the LORD dealt thus with this great city?”
Jeremiah 22-9 <f>ⓞ</f> And they will answer, “Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and worshiped other gods and served them.”’”
Jeremiah 22-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> Weep not for him who is dead, </t><t>nor grieve for him, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>but weep bitterly for him who goes away, </t><t>for he shall return no more </t><t>to see his native land. </t>
Jeremiah 22-11 <pb/>For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and <f>ⓡ</f>who went away from this place: “He shall return here no more,
Jeremiah 22-12 but <f>ⓢ</f>in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall never see this land again.”
Jeremiah 22-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> “Woe to him who builds his house by <f>ⓤ</f>unrighteousness, </t><t>and his upper rooms by injustice, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing </t><t>and does not give him his wages,</t>
Jeremiah 22-14 <t>who says, ‘I will build myself a great house </t><t>with spacious upper rooms,’ </t><t>who cuts out windows for it, </t><t>paneling it with cedar </t><t>and <f>ⓦ</f>painting it with vermilion.</t>
Jeremiah 22-15 <t>Do you think you are a king </t><t>because you compete in cedar? </t><t>Did not your father eat and drink </t><t>and <f>ⓧ</f>do justice and righteousness? </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>Then it was well with him.</t>
Jeremiah 22-16 <t><f>ⓩ</f> He judged the cause of the poor and needy; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>then it was well. </t><t>Is not this <f>ⓑ</f>to know me? </t><t>declares the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 22-17 <t>But you have eyes and heart </t><t>only for your dishonest gain, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>for shedding innocent blood, </t><t>and for practicing oppression and violence.” </t>
Jeremiah 22-18 <pb/>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“They shall not lament for him, saying, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>‘Ah, my brother!’ or ‘Ah, sister!’ </t><t>They shall not lament for him, saying, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>‘Ah, lord!’ or ‘Ah, his majesty!’</t>
Jeremiah 22-19 <t>With the burial of a donkey <f>ⓖ</f>he shall be buried, </t><t>dragged and dumped beyond the gates of Jerusalem.” </t>
Jeremiah 22-20 <pb/><t>“Go up to Lebanon, and cry out, </t><t>and lift up your voice in Bashan; </t><t>cry out from <f>ⓗ</f>Abarim, </t><t>for all <f>ⓘ</f>your lovers are destroyed.</t>
Jeremiah 22-21 <t>I spoke to you in your prosperity, </t><t>but you said, ‘I will not listen.’ </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>This has been your way from <f>ⓚ</f>your youth, </t><t>that you have not obeyed my voice.</t>
Jeremiah 22-22 <t><f>ⓛ</f> The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds, </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>your lovers shall go into captivity; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>then you will be ashamed and confounded </t><t>because of all your evil.</t>
Jeremiah 22-23 <t>O inhabitant of <f>ⓞ</f>Lebanon, </t><t>nested among the cedars, </t><t>how you will be pitied when pangs come upon you, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>pain as of a woman in labor!” </t>
Jeremiah 22-24 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “As I live, declares the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were <f>ⓡ</f>the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off
Jeremiah 22-25 and <f>ⓢ</f>give you <f>ⓣ</f>into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah 22-26 <f>ⓤ</f> I will hurl you and <f>ⓥ</f>the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die.
Jeremiah 22-27 But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return.”
Jeremiah 22-28 <pb/><t>Is this man <f>ⓦ</f>Coniah a despised, broken pot, </t><t>a <f>ⓧ</f>vessel no one cares for? </t><t>Why are he and his children hurled and cast </t><t>into a <f>ⓨ</f>land that they do not know?</t>
Jeremiah 22-29 <t><f>ⓩ</f> O land, land, land, </t><t>hear the word of the LORD!</t>
Jeremiah 22-30 <t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t>“Write this man down as <f>ⓐ</f>childless, </t><t>a man who shall not succeed in his days, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>for none of his offspring shall succeed </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>in sitting on the throne of David </t><t>and ruling again in Judah.” </t>
Philemon 1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and <f>ⓑ</f>Timothy our brother, <pb/>To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
Philemon 1-2 and Apphia our sister and <f>ⓒ</f>Archippus our <f>ⓓ</f>fellow soldier, and <f>ⓔ</f>the church in your house:
Philemon 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon 1-4 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,
Philemon 1-5 because I <f>ⓗ</f>hear of your love and <f>ⓘ</f>of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,
Philemon 1-6 and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full <f>ⓙ</f>knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. <f>[1]</f>
Philemon 1-7 For I have derived much joy and <f>ⓚ</f>comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints <f>ⓛ</f>have been refreshed through you.
Philemon 1-8 <pb/>Accordingly, <f>ⓜ</f>though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do <f>ⓝ</f>what is required,
Philemon 1-9 yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you — I, Paul, an old man and now <f>ⓞ</f>a prisoner also for Christ Jesus —
Philemon 1-10 I appeal to you for <f>ⓟ</f>my child, <f>ⓠ</f>Onesimus, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>whose father I became in my imprisonment.
Philemon 1-11 (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)
Philemon 1-12 I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
Philemon 1-13 I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me <f>ⓢ</f>on your behalf <f>ⓣ</f>during my imprisonment for the gospel,
Philemon 1-14 but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be <f>ⓤ</f>by compulsion but of your own accord.
Philemon 1-15 For this perhaps is why <f>ⓥ</f>he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
Philemon 1-16 <f>ⓦ</f> no longer as a bondservant <f>[3]</f> but more than a bondservant, as <f>ⓧ</f>a beloved brother — especially to me, but how much more to you, <f>ⓨ</f>both in the flesh and in the Lord.
Philemon 1-17 <pb/>So if you consider me <f>ⓩ</f>your partner, receive him as you would receive me.
Philemon 1-18 If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
Philemon 1-19 <f>ⓐ</f> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it — to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
Philemon 1-20 Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. <f>ⓑ</f>Refresh my heart in Christ.
Philemon 1-21 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
Philemon 1-22 At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for <f>ⓓ</f>I am hoping that <f>ⓔ</f>through your prayers <f>ⓕ</f>I will be graciously given to you.
Philemon 1-23 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Epaphras, my <f>ⓗ</f>fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
Philemon 1-24 and so do <f>ⓘ</f>Mark, <f>ⓙ</f>Aristarchus, <f>ⓚ</f>Demas, and <f>ⓛ</f>Luke, my fellow workers.
Philemon 1-25 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
