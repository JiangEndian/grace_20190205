1 Kings 12-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Rehoboam went to <f>ⓑ</f>Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
1 Kings 12-2 And as soon as <f>ⓒ</f>Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for <f>ⓓ</f>he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from <f>[1]</f> Egypt.
1 Kings 12-3 And they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
1 Kings 12-4 <f>ⓔ</f> “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.”
1 Kings 12-5 He said to them, <f>ⓕ</f>“Go away for three days, then come again to me.” So the people went away.
1 Kings 12-6 <pb/>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?”
1 Kings 12-7 And they said to him, “If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever.”
1 Kings 12-8 But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.
1 Kings 12-9 And he said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us’?”
1 Kings 12-10 And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,’ thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.
1 Kings 12-11 And now, whereas <f>ⓖ</f>my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”
1 Kings 12-12 <pb/>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Come to me again the third day.”
1 Kings 12-13 And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him,
1 Kings 12-14 he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, <f>ⓘ</f>“My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”
1 Kings 12-15 So the king did not listen to the people, for <f>ⓙ</f>it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfill his word, which <f>ⓚ</f>the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1 Kings 12-16 <pb/>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, “What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. <f>ⓛ</f>To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.” So Israel went to their tents.
1 Kings 12-17 But Rehoboam reigned over <f>ⓜ</f>the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.
1 Kings 12-18 Then King Rehoboam sent <f>ⓝ</f>Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
1 Kings 12-19 <f>ⓞ</f> So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
1 Kings 12-20 And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David but <f>ⓟ</f>the tribe of Judah only.
1 Kings 12-21 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
1 Kings 12-22 But the word of God came to <f>ⓡ</f>Shemaiah the man of God:
1 Kings 12-23 “Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the <f>ⓢ</f>rest of the people,
1 Kings 12-24 ‘Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel. Every man return to his home, <f>ⓣ</f>for this thing is from me.’” So they listened to the word of the LORD and went home again, according to the word of the LORD.
1 Kings 12-25 <pb/>Then Jeroboam <f>ⓤ</f>built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And he went out from there and <f>ⓥ</f>built Penuel.
1 Kings 12-26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David.
1 Kings 12-27 If this people <f>ⓦ</f>go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”
1 Kings 12-28 So the king took counsel and <f>ⓧ</f>made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, “You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. <f>ⓨ</f>Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”
1 Kings 12-29 And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
1 Kings 12-30 Then <f>ⓩ</f>this thing became a sin, for the people went as far as Dan to be before one. <f>[2]</f>
1 Kings 12-31 He also made <f>ⓐ</f>temples on high places and <f>ⓑ</f>appointed priests from among all the people, who were not of the Levites.
1 Kings 12-32 And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like <f>ⓒ</f>the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he made. And he placed in Bethel <f>ⓓ</f>the priests of the high places that he had made.
1 Kings 12-33 He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised from his own heart. And he instituted a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar <f>ⓔ</f>to make offerings.
Ecclesiastes 9-1 <pb/>But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, <f>ⓐ</f>how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are <f>ⓑ</f>in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.
Ecclesiastes 9-2 <f>ⓒ</f> It is the same for all, since <f>ⓓ</f>the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, <f>[1]</f> to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who <f>ⓔ</f>swears is as he who shuns an oath.
Ecclesiastes 9-3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that <f>ⓕ</f>the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and <f>ⓖ</f>madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
Ecclesiastes 9-4 But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
Ecclesiastes 9-5 For the living know that they will die, but <f>ⓗ</f>the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for <f>ⓘ</f>the memory of them is forgotten.
Ecclesiastes 9-6 Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 9-7 <pb/>Go, <f>ⓙ</f>eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.
Ecclesiastes 9-8 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Let your garments be always white. Let not <f>ⓛ</f>oil be lacking on your head.
Ecclesiastes 9-9 <pb/>Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your <f>ⓜ</f>vain <f>[2]</f> life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your <f>ⓝ</f>portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 9-10 Whatever your hand finds to do, <f>ⓞ</f>do it with your might, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.
Ecclesiastes 9-11 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Again I saw that under the sun <f>ⓡ</f>the race is not to the swift, nor <f>ⓢ</f>the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and <f>ⓣ</f>chance <f>ⓤ</f>happen to them all.
Ecclesiastes 9-12 For man <f>ⓥ</f>does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and <f>ⓦ</f>like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are <f>ⓧ</f>snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.
Ecclesiastes 9-13 <pb/>I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.
Ecclesiastes 9-14 There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.
Ecclesiastes 9-15 But there was found in it <f>ⓨ</f>a poor, wise man, and he by his <f>ⓩ</f>wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
Ecclesiastes 9-16 But I say that <f>ⓐ</f>wisdom is better than might, though <f>ⓑ</f>the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.
Ecclesiastes 9-17 <pb/>The words of the wise heard in <f>ⓒ</f>quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
Ecclesiastes 9-18 <f>ⓓ</f> Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but <f>ⓔ</f>one sinner destroys much good.
Acts 15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> But some men came down from Judea and were teaching <f>ⓑ</f>the brothers, “Unless you are <f>ⓒ</f>circumcised <f>ⓓ</f>according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”
Acts 15-2 And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and <f>ⓔ</f>debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and <f>ⓕ</f>some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to <f>ⓖ</f>the apostles and the elders about this question.
Acts 15-3 So, <f>ⓗ</f>being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, <f>ⓘ</f>describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and <f>ⓙ</f>brought great joy to all <f>ⓚ</f>the brothers. <f>[1]</f>
Acts 15-4 <f>ⓛ</f> When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and <f>ⓜ</f>the apostles and the elders, and <f>ⓝ</f>they declared all that God had done with them.
Acts 15-5 But some believers who belonged to <f>ⓞ</f>the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, <f>ⓟ</f>“It is necessary <f>ⓠ</f>to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.”
Acts 15-6 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> The <f>ⓢ</f>apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.
Acts 15-7 And after there had been much <f>ⓣ</f>debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, <f>ⓤ</f>that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear <f>ⓥ</f>the word of <f>ⓦ</f>the gospel and believe.
Acts 15-8 And God, <f>ⓧ</f>who knows the heart, <f>ⓨ</f>bore witness to them, <f>ⓩ</f>by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,
Acts 15-9 and <f>ⓐ</f>he made no distinction between us and them, <f>ⓑ</f>having cleansed their hearts <f>ⓒ</f>by faith.
Acts 15-10 Now, therefore, why <f>ⓓ</f>are you putting God to the test <f>ⓔ</f>by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples <f>ⓕ</f>that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
Acts 15-11 But we <f>ⓖ</f>believe that we will be <f>ⓗ</f>saved through <f>ⓘ</f>the grace of the Lord Jesus, <f>ⓙ</f>just as they will.”
Acts 15-12 <pb/>And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul <f>ⓚ</f>as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
Acts 15-13 After they finished speaking, <f>ⓛ</f>James replied, “Brothers, listen to me.
Acts 15-14 <f>ⓜ</f> Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them <f>ⓝ</f>a people for his name.
Acts 15-15 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,
Acts 15-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> “‘After this I will return, </t><t>and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; </t><t>I will rebuild its ruins, </t><t>and I will restore it,</t>
Acts 15-17 <t>that the remnant <f>[2]</f> of mankind <f>ⓟ</f>may seek the Lord, </t><t>and all the Gentiles <f>ⓠ</f>who are called by my name, </t><t>says the Lord, who makes these things </t>
Acts 15-18 <t><f>ⓡ</f> known from of old.’ </t>
Acts 15-19 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓢ</f>my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who <f>ⓣ</f>turn to God,
Acts 15-20 but should write to them <f>ⓤ</f>to abstain from <f>ⓥ</f>the things polluted by idols, and from <f>ⓦ</f>sexual immorality, and from <f>ⓧ</f>what has been strangled, and from <f>ⓨ</f>blood.
Acts 15-21 For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, <f>ⓩ</f>for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”
Acts 15-22 <pb/>Then it seemed good to <f>ⓐ</f>the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called <f>ⓑ</f>Barsabbas, and <f>ⓒ</f>Silas, leading men among <f>ⓓ</f>the brothers,
Acts 15-23 with the following letter: <f>ⓔ</f>“The brothers, both <f>ⓕ</f>the apostles and the elders, to the brothers <f>[3]</f> who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, <f>ⓖ</f>greetings.
Acts 15-24 Since we have heard that <f>ⓗ</f>some persons have gone out from us and <f>ⓘ</f>troubled you <f>[4]</f> with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,
Acts 15-25 it has seemed good to us, having come <f>ⓙ</f>to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our <f>ⓚ</f>beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Acts 15-26 <f>ⓛ</f> men who have <f>ⓜ</f>risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts 15-27 We have therefore sent <f>ⓝ</f>Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.
Acts 15-28 For it has seemed good <f>ⓞ</f>to the Holy Spirit and <f>ⓟ</f>to us <f>ⓠ</f>to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements:
Acts 15-29 <f>ⓡ</f> that you abstain from <f>ⓢ</f>what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.”
Acts 15-30 <pb/>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
Acts 15-31 And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
Acts 15-32 And Judas and Silas, who were themselves <f>ⓣ</f>prophets, encouraged and <f>ⓤ</f>strengthened <f>ⓥ</f>the brothers with many words.
Acts 15-33 And after they had spent some time, they were sent off <f>ⓦ</f>in peace by <f>ⓧ</f>the brothers to those who had sent them. <f>[5]</f>
Acts 15-34 
Acts 15-35 But <f>ⓨ</f>Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
Acts 15-36 <pb/>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return and visit <f>ⓩ</f>the brothers <f>ⓐ</f>in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.”
Acts 15-37 Now Barnabas wanted to take with them <f>ⓑ</f>John called Mark.
Acts 15-38 But Paul thought best not to take with them one <f>ⓒ</f>who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
Acts 15-39 And there arose <f>ⓓ</f>a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. <f>ⓔ</f>Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,
Acts 15-40 but Paul chose Silas and departed, <f>ⓕ</f>having been commended by <f>ⓖ</f>the brothers to <f>ⓗ</f>the grace of the Lord.
Acts 15-41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, <f>ⓘ</f>strengthening the churches.
