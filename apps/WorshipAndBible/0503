Exodus 18-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Jethro, <f>ⓑ</f>the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus 18-2 Now Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her home,
Exodus 18-3 along with her <f>ⓒ</f>two sons. The name of the one was Gershom (<f>ⓓ</f>for he said, <f>ⓔ</f>“I have been a sojourner <f>[1]</f> in a foreign land”),
Exodus 18-4 and the name of the other, Eliezer <f>[2]</f> (for he said, “The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).
Exodus 18-5 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped at the <f>ⓕ</f>mountain of God.
Exodus 18-6 And when he sent word to Moses, “I, <f>[3]</f> your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her,”
Exodus 18-7 Moses <f>ⓖ</f>went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and <f>ⓗ</f>kissed him. And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent.
Exodus 18-8 Then Moses told his father-in-law <f>ⓘ</f>all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the LORD had delivered them.
Exodus 18-9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus 18-10 <pb/>Jethro said, <f>ⓙ</f>“Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus 18-11 Now I know that <f>ⓚ</f>the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they <f>ⓛ</f>dealt arrogantly with the people.” <f>[4]</f>
Exodus 18-12 And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law <f>ⓜ</f>before God.
Exodus 18-13 <pb/>The next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening.
Exodus 18-14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?”
Exodus 18-15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because <f>ⓝ</f>the people come to me to inquire of God;
Exodus 18-16 <f>ⓞ</f> when they have a dispute, they come to me and I decide between one person and another, and I <f>ⓟ</f>make them know the statutes of God and his laws.”
Exodus 18-17 Moses' father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good.
Exodus 18-18 You and the people with you will certainly wear yourselves out, for the thing is too heavy for you. <f>ⓠ</f>You are not able to do it alone.
Exodus 18-19 Now obey my voice; I will give you advice, and God be with you! You shall <f>ⓡ</f>represent the people before God and <f>ⓢ</f>bring their cases to God,
Exodus 18-20 and you shall warn them about the statutes and the laws, and make them know <f>ⓣ</f>the way in which they must walk and <f>ⓤ</f>what they must do.
Exodus 18-21 Moreover, look for <f>ⓥ</f>able men from all the people, men who fear God, who are trustworthy and hate a bribe, and place such men over the people as chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
Exodus 18-22 And <f>ⓦ</f>let them judge the people at all times. <f>ⓧ</f>Every great matter they shall bring to you, but any small matter they shall decide themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will <f>ⓨ</f>bear the burden with you.
Exodus 18-23 If you do this, God will direct you, you will be <f>ⓩ</f>able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.”
Exodus 18-24 <pb/>So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
Exodus 18-25 <f>ⓐ</f> Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
Exodus 18-26 And <f>ⓑ</f>they judged the people at all times. Any hard case they brought to Moses, but any small matter they decided themselves.
Exodus 18-27 Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and <f>ⓒ</f>he went away to his own country.
Esther 7-1 <pb/>So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther.
Esther 7-2 And on the second day, as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king again said to Esther, <f>ⓐ</f>“What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? <f>ⓑ</f>Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.”
Esther 7-3 Then Queen Esther answered, <f>ⓒ</f>“If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be granted me for my wish, and my people for my request.
Esther 7-4 <f>ⓓ</f> For we have been sold, I and my people, <f>ⓔ</f>to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have been silent, for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king.”
Esther 7-5 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who has dared <f>[1]</f> to do this?”
Esther 7-6 And Esther said, <f>ⓕ</f>“A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!” Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.
Esther 7-7 <pb/>And the king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into <f>ⓖ</f>the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king.
Esther 7-8 And the king returned from <f>ⓗ</f>the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on <f>ⓘ</f>the couch where Esther was. And the king said, “Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?” As the word left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman's face.
Esther 7-9 Then <f>ⓙ</f>Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, “Moreover, <f>ⓚ</f>the gallows <f>[2]</f> that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, <f>ⓛ</f>whose word saved the king, is standing at Haman's house, fifty cubits <f>[3]</f> high.” And the king said, “Hang him on that.”
Esther 7-10 <f>ⓜ</f> So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. <f>ⓝ</f>Then the wrath of the king abated.

1 John 5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Everyone who believes that <f>ⓑ</f>Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and <f>ⓒ</f>everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
1 John 5-2 <f>ⓓ</f> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.
1 John 5-3 For <f>ⓔ</f>this is the love of God, that we <f>ⓕ</f>keep his commandments. And <f>ⓖ</f>his commandments are not burdensome.
1 John 5-4 For <f>ⓗ</f>everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world — <f>ⓘ</f>our faith.
1 John 5-5 Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes <f>ⓙ</f>that Jesus is the Son of God?
1 John 5-6 <pb/>This is he who came <f>ⓚ</f>by water and blood — Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And <f>ⓛ</f>the Spirit is the one who testifies, because <f>ⓜ</f>the Spirit is the truth.
1 John 5-7 For there are three that testify:
1 John 5-8 the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.
1 John 5-9 <f>ⓝ</f> If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God <f>ⓞ</f>that he has borne concerning his Son.
1 John 5-10 Whoever believes in the Son of God <f>ⓟ</f>has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God <f>ⓠ</f>has made him a liar, <f>ⓡ</f>because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.
1 John 5-11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us <f>ⓢ</f>eternal life, and <f>ⓣ</f>this life is in his Son.
1 John 5-12 <f>ⓤ</f> Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
1 John 5-13 <pb/>I write <f>ⓥ</f>these things to you who <f>ⓦ</f>believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.
1 John 5-14 And this is <f>ⓧ</f>the confidence that we have toward him, that <f>ⓨ</f>if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.
1 John 5-15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.
1 John 5-16 <pb/>If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and <f>ⓩ</f>God <f>[1]</f> will give him life — to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. <f>ⓐ</f>There is sin that leads to death; <f>ⓑ</f>I do not say that one should pray for that.
1 John 5-17 <f>ⓒ</f> All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
1 John 5-18 <pb/>We know that <f>ⓓ</f>everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but <f>ⓔ</f>he who was born of God <f>ⓕ</f>protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
1 John 5-19 <pb/>We know that we are from God, and <f>ⓖ</f>the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
1 John 5-20 <pb/>And we know that the Son of God has come and <f>ⓗ</f>has given us understanding, so that we may know <f>ⓘ</f>him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and <f>ⓙ</f>eternal life.
