4-1 <pb/>Now Boaz had gone up to <f>ⓐ</f>the gate and sat down there. And behold, <f>ⓑ</f>the redeemer, of whom Boaz had spoken, came by. So Boaz said, “Turn aside, friend; sit down here.” And he turned aside and sat down.
4-2 And he took ten men <f>ⓒ</f>of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down.
4-3 Then he said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.
4-4 So I thought I would tell you of it and say, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people.’ If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you <f>[1]</f> will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you.” And he said, “I will redeem it.”
4-5 Then Boaz said, “The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth <f>[2]</f> the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order <f>ⓔ</f>to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance.”
4-6 <f>ⓕ</f> Then the redeemer said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”
4-7 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel.
4-8 So when the redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” he drew off his sandal.
4-9 Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to <f>ⓗ</f>Chilion and to Mahlon.
4-10 Also Ruth the Moabite, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, <f>ⓘ</f>to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his native place. You are witnesses this day.”
4-11 Then all the people who were <f>ⓙ</f>at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, <f>ⓚ</f>who together <f>ⓛ</f>built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in <f>ⓜ</f>Ephrathah and <f>ⓝ</f>be renowned in Bethlehem,
4-12 and may your house be like the house of Perez, <f>ⓞ</f>whom Tamar bore to Judah, because <f>ⓟ</f>of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman.”
4-13 <pb/>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, <f>ⓠ</f>and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.
4-14 <f>ⓡ</f> Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without <f>ⓢ</f>a redeemer, and may his name <f>ⓣ</f>be renowned in Israel!
4-15 He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law who loves you, <f>ⓤ</f>who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”
4-16 Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse.
4-17 <f>ⓥ</f> And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
4-18 <pb/>Now these are the generations of Perez: <f>ⓦ</f>Perez fathered Hezron,
4-19 Hezron fathered Ram, Ram fathered Amminadab,
4-20 <f>ⓧ</f> Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon,
4-21 Salmon fathered Boaz, Boaz fathered Obed,
4-22 Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David.
123-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> To you I <f>ⓑ</f>lift up my eyes, </t><t>O you who are <f>ⓒ</f>enthroned in the heavens!</t>
123-2 <t>Behold, as the eyes of servants </t><t>look to the hand of their master, </t><t>as the eyes of a maidservant </t><t>to the hand of her mistress, </t><t>so our eyes look to the LORD our God, </t><t>till he has mercy upon us. </t>
123-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us, </t><t>for we have had more than enough of <f>ⓔ</f>contempt.</t>
123-4 <t>Our soul has had more than enough </t><t>of <f>ⓕ</f>the scorn of <f>ⓖ</f>those who are at ease, </t><t>of the contempt of <f>ⓗ</f>the proud. </t>
9-1 <pb/>And he said to them, <J>“Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not <f>ⓐ</f>taste death <f>ⓑ</f>until they see the kingdom of God after it has come <f>ⓒ</f>with power.”</J>
9-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> And after six days Jesus took with him <f>ⓔ</f>Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was <f>ⓕ</f>transfigured before them,
9-3 and <f>ⓖ</f>his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one <f>[1]</f> on earth could bleach them.
9-4 And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
9-5 And Peter said to Jesus, <f>ⓗ</f>“Rabbi, <f>[2]</f> it is good that we are here. Let us make three <f>ⓘ</f>tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
9-6 For <f>ⓙ</f>he did not know what to say, for they were terrified.
9-7 And <f>ⓚ</f>a cloud overshadowed them, and <f>ⓛ</f>a voice came out of the cloud, <f>ⓜ</f>“This is my beloved Son; <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>listen to him.”
9-8 And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only.
9-9 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> And as they were coming down the mountain, <f>ⓟ</f>he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, <f>ⓠ</f>until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
9-10 <f>ⓡ</f> So they kept the matter to themselves, <f>ⓢ</f>questioning what this rising from the dead might mean.
9-11 And they asked him, “Why do the scribes say <f>ⓣ</f>that first Elijah must come?”
9-12 And he said to them, <J>“Elijah does come first <f>ⓤ</f>to restore all things. And <f>ⓥ</f>how is it written of the Son of Man that he should <f>ⓦ</f>suffer many things and <f>ⓧ</f>be treated with contempt?</J>
9-13 <J>But I tell you that Elijah has come, and <f>ⓨ</f>they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.”</J>
9-14 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.
9-15 And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, <f>ⓐ</f>were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him.
9-16 And he asked them, <J>“What are you arguing about with them?”</J>
9-17 And someone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has <f>ⓑ</f>a spirit that makes him mute.
9-18 And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and <f>ⓒ</f>they were not able.”
9-19 And he answered them, <J>“O <f>ⓓ</f>faithless generation, <f>ⓔ</f>how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.”</J>
9-20 And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it <f>ⓕ</f>convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
9-21 And Jesus asked his father, <J>“How long has this been happening to him?”</J> And he said, “From childhood.
9-22 And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But <f>ⓖ</f>if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”
9-23 And Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“‘If you can’! <f>ⓘ</f>All things are possible for one who believes.”</J>
9-24 Immediately the father of the child cried out <f>[4]</f> and said, “I believe; <f>ⓙ</f>help my unbelief!”
9-25 And when Jesus saw that <f>ⓚ</f>a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.”</J>
9-26 And after crying out and <f>ⓜ</f>convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, “He is dead.”
9-27 But Jesus <f>ⓝ</f>took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
9-28 And when he had <f>ⓞ</f>entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?”
9-29 And he said to them, <J>“This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.” <f>[5]</f></J>
9-30 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know,
9-31 for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, <J>“The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, <f>ⓠ</f>after three days he will rise.”</J>
9-32 <f>ⓡ</f> But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
9-33 <pb/>And <f>ⓢ</f>they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house <f>ⓣ</f>he asked them, <J>“What were you discussing on the way?”</J>
9-34 But they kept silent, for on the way <f>ⓤ</f>they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.
9-35 And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.”</J>
9-36 And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and <f>ⓦ</f>taking him in his arms, he said to them,
9-37 <J><f>ⓧ</f> “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and <f>ⓨ</f>whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.”</J>
9-38 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone <f>ⓐ</f>casting out demons in your name, <f>[6]</f> and <f>ⓑ</f>we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”
9-39 But Jesus said, <J>“Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.</J>
9-40 <J><f>ⓒ</f> For the one who is not against us is for us.</J>
9-41 <J>For truly, I say to you, <f>ⓓ</f>whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward.</J>
9-42 <pb/><J><f>ⓔ</f> “Whoever causes one of <f>ⓕ</f>these little ones who believe in me to sin, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.</J>
9-43 <J><f>ⓗ</f> And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to <f>ⓘ</f>hell, <f>[8]</f> to <f>ⓙ</f>the unquenchable fire. <f>[9]</f></J>
9-44 
9-45 <J><f>ⓚ</f> And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into <f>ⓛ</f>hell.</J>
9-46 
9-47 <J><f>ⓜ</f> And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into <f>ⓝ</f>hell,</J>
9-48 <J>‘where <f>ⓞ</f>their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.’</J>
9-49 <J>For everyone will be salted with fire. <f>[10]</f></J>
9-50 <J><f>ⓟ</f> Salt is good, <f>ⓠ</f>but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? <f>ⓡ</f>Have salt in yourselves, and <f>ⓢ</f>be at peace with one another.”</J>
