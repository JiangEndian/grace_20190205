27-1 <pb/>Then drew near the daughters of <f>ⓐ</f>Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the clans of Manasseh the son of Joseph. The names of his daughters were: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
27-2 And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the chiefs and all the congregation, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, saying,
27-3 “Our father <f>ⓑ</f>died in the wilderness. He was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>in the company of Korah, but <f>ⓓ</f>died for his own sin. And he had no sons.
27-4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan because he had no son? <f>ⓔ</f>Give to us a possession among our father's brothers.”
27-5 <pb/>Moses <f>ⓕ</f>brought their case before the LORD.
27-6 And the LORD said to Moses,
27-7 “The daughters of Zelophehad <f>ⓖ</f>are right. <f>ⓗ</f>You shall give them possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers and transfer the inheritance of their father to them.
27-8 And you shall speak to the people of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies and has no son, then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
27-9 And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
27-10 And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
27-11 And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the nearest <f>ⓘ</f>kinsman of his clan, and he shall possess it. And it shall be for the people of Israel <f>ⓙ</f>a statute and rule, as the LORD commanded Moses.’”
27-12 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses, “Go up into <f>ⓚ</f>this mountain of Abarim and see the land that I have given to the people of Israel.
27-13 When you have seen it, you also <f>ⓛ</f>shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,
27-14 <f>ⓜ</f> because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin when the congregation quarreled, failing <f>ⓝ</f>to uphold me as holy at the waters before their eyes.” (These are <f>ⓞ</f>the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
27-15 Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,
27-16 “Let the LORD, <f>ⓟ</f>the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation
27-17 who <f>ⓠ</f>shall go out before them and come in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the LORD may not be <f>ⓡ</f>as sheep that have no shepherd.”
27-18 So the LORD said to Moses, “Take <f>ⓢ</f>Joshua the son of Nun, a man <f>ⓣ</f>in whom is the Spirit, and <f>ⓤ</f>lay your hand on him.
27-19 Make him stand before Eleazar the priest and all the congregation, and you shall <f>ⓥ</f>commission him in their sight.
27-20 You shall invest him with some of your authority, <f>ⓦ</f>that all the congregation of the people of Israel may obey.
27-21 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him <f>ⓧ</f>by the judgment of the Urim before the LORD. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the people of Israel with him, the whole congregation.”
27-22 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and made him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation,
27-23 and he laid his hands on him and <f>ⓨ</f>commissioned him as the LORD directed through Moses.
31-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> In you, O LORD, do I <f>ⓑ</f>take refuge; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>let me never be put to shame; </t><t>in your <f>ⓓ</f>righteousness deliver me!</t>
31-2 <t>Incline your ear to me; </t><t>rescue me speedily! </t><t>Be <f>ⓔ</f>a rock of <f>ⓕ</f>refuge for me, </t><t>a strong fortress to save me! </t>
31-3 <pb/><t>For you are my rock and my fortress; </t><t>and for your <f>ⓖ</f>name's sake you lead me and guide me;</t>
31-4 <t>you <f>ⓗ</f>take me out of <f>ⓘ</f>the net they have hidden for me, </t><t>for you are my <f>ⓙ</f>refuge.</t>
31-5 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Into your hand I commit my spirit; </t><t>you have redeemed me, O LORD, <f>ⓛ</f>faithful God. </t>
31-6 <pb/><t>I <f>ⓜ</f>hate <f>[1]</f> those who pay <f>ⓝ</f>regard to worthless <f>ⓞ</f>idols, </t><t>but I trust in the LORD.</t>
31-7 <t>I will rejoice and be glad in your steadfast love, </t><t>because you have seen my affliction; </t><t>you have <f>ⓟ</f>known the distress of my soul,</t>
31-8 <t>and you have not <f>ⓠ</f>delivered me into the hand of the enemy; </t><t>you have set my feet in <f>ⓡ</f>a broad place. </t>
31-9 <pb/><t>Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am <f>ⓢ</f>in distress; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>my eye is wasted from grief; </t><t>my soul and my body also.</t>
31-10 <t>For my life is spent with sorrow, </t><t>and my years with sighing; </t><t>my strength fails because of my iniquity, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>my bones waste away. </t>
31-11 <pb/><t>Because of all my adversaries I have become <f>ⓥ</f>a reproach, </t><t>especially to my <f>ⓦ</f>neighbors, </t><t>and an object of dread to my acquaintances; </t><t>those who see me in the street <f>ⓧ</f>flee from me.</t>
31-12 <t>I have been <f>ⓨ</f>forgotten like one who is dead; </t><t>I have become like <f>ⓩ</f>a broken vessel.</t>
31-13 <t>For I <f>ⓐ</f>hear the whispering of many — </t><t>terror on every side! — </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>as they scheme together against me, </t><t>as they plot to take my life. </t>
31-14 <pb/><t>But I <f>ⓒ</f>trust in you, O LORD; </t><t>I say, “You are my God.”</t>
31-15 <t>My <f>ⓓ</f>times are in your hand; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from my persecutors!</t>
31-16 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Make your face shine on your servant; </t><t>save me in your steadfast love!</t>
31-17 <t>O LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>let me not be put to shame, </t><t>for I call upon you; </t><t>let the wicked be put to shame; </t><t>let them go <f>ⓗ</f>silently to Sheol.</t>
31-18 <t>Let the lying lips be mute, </t><t>which <f>ⓘ</f>speak <f>ⓙ</f>insolently against the righteous </t><t>in pride and contempt. </t>
31-19 <pb/><t>Oh, how abundant is your goodness, </t><t>which you have stored up for those who fear you </t><t>and worked for those who take refuge in you, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>in the sight of the children of mankind!</t>
31-20 <t>In <f>ⓛ</f>the cover of your presence you hide them </t><t>from the plots of men; </t><t>you <f>ⓜ</f>store them in your shelter </t><t>from the strife of tongues. </t>
31-21 <pb/><t>Blessed be the LORD, </t><t>for he has wondrously <f>ⓝ</f>shown his steadfast love to me </t><t>when I was in <f>ⓞ</f>a besieged city.</t>
31-22 <t>I had said in my <f>ⓟ</f>alarm, <f>[2]</f> </t><t>“I am <f>ⓠ</f>cut off from <f>ⓡ</f>your sight.” </t><t>But you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy </t><t>when I cried to you for help. </t>
31-23 <pb/><t>Love the LORD, all you his <f>ⓢ</f>saints! </t><t>The LORD preserves the faithful </t><t>but abundantly <f>ⓣ</f>repays the one who acts in pride.</t>
31-24 <t><f>ⓤ</f> Be strong, and let your heart take courage, </t><t>all you who wait for the LORD! </t>
12-1 <pb/><t><pb/>Ephraim feeds on the wind </t><t>and pursues <f>ⓐ</f>the east wind all day long; </t><t>they multiply <f>ⓑ</f>falsehood and violence; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>they make a covenant with Assyria, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>oil is carried to Egypt. </t>
12-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> The LORD has an indictment against Judah </t><t>and will punish Jacob according to his ways; </t><t>he will repay him according to his deeds.</t>
12-3 <t><f>ⓕ</f> In the womb he took his brother by the heel, </t><t>and in his manhood he strove with God.</t>
12-4 <t>He strove with the angel and prevailed; </t><t>he wept and sought his favor. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>He met God <f>[1]</f> at Bethel, </t><t>and there God spoke with us — </t>

12-6 <t>“So you, <f>ⓘ</f>by the help of your God, return, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>hold fast to love and justice, </t><t>and wait continually for your God.” </t>
12-7 <pb/><t>A merchant, in whose hands are <f>ⓚ</f>false balances, </t><t>he loves <f>ⓛ</f>to oppress.</t>

12-12 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Jacob fled to the land of Aram; </t><t>there Israel <f>ⓧ</f>served for a wife, </t><t>and for a wife he guarded sheep.</t>
12-13 <t>By <f>ⓨ</f>a prophet <f>ⓩ</f>the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, </t><t>and by a prophet he was guarded.</t>
12-14 <t><f>ⓐ</f> Ephraim has given bitter provocation; </t><t>so his Lord <f>ⓑ</f>will leave his bloodguilt on him </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and will repay him for his disgraceful deeds. </t>
