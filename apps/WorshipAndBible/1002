Judges 9-1 <pb/>Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to <f>ⓐ</f>his mother's relatives and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother's family,
Judges 9-2 “Say in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that all <f>ⓑ</f>seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that <f>ⓒ</f>I am <f>ⓓ</f>your bone and your flesh.”
Judges 9-3 <pb/>And his mother's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, <f>ⓔ</f>“He is our brother.”
Judges 9-4 And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of <f>ⓕ</f>Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired <f>ⓖ</f>worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him.
Judges 9-5 And he went to his father's house at <f>ⓗ</f>Ophrah <f>ⓘ</f>and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.
Judges 9-6 And all the leaders of Shechem came together, and all <f>ⓙ</f>Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem.
Judges 9-7 <pb/>When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on top of <f>ⓚ</f>Mount Gerizim and cried aloud and said to them, “Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you.
Judges 9-8 <f>ⓛ</f> The trees once went out to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, <f>ⓜ</f>‘Reign over us.’
Judges 9-9 But the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my abundance, by which gods and men are honored, and go hold sway over the trees?’
Judges 9-10 And the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us.’
Judges 9-11 But the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go hold sway over the trees?’
Judges 9-12 And the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us.’
Judges 9-13 But the vine said to them, ‘Shall I leave my wine that <f>ⓝ</f>cheers God and men and go hold sway over the trees?’
Judges 9-14 Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us.’
Judges 9-15 And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and <f>ⓞ</f>take refuge in my shade, but if not, <f>ⓟ</f>let fire come out of the bramble and devour <f>ⓠ</f>the cedars of Lebanon.’
Judges 9-16 <pb/>“Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and integrity when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with <f>ⓡ</f>Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him <f>ⓢ</f>as his deeds deserved —
Judges 9-17 for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian,
Judges 9-18 and you have risen up against my father's house this day <f>ⓣ</f>and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made <f>ⓤ</f>Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the leaders of Shechem, <f>ⓥ</f>because he is your relative —
Judges 9-19 if you then have acted in good faith and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then <f>ⓦ</f>rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
Judges 9-20 But if not, <f>ⓧ</f>let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech.”
Judges 9-21 And Jotham ran away and fled and went to <f>ⓨ</f>Beer and lived there, because of Abimelech his brother.
Judges 9-22 <pb/>Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
Judges 9-23 <f>ⓩ</f> And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem <f>ⓐ</f>dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
Judges 9-24 <f>ⓑ</f> that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
Judges 9-25 And the leaders of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way. And it was told to Abimelech.
Judges 9-26 <pb/>And Gaal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his relatives, and the leaders of Shechem put confidence in him.
Judges 9-27 And they went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them and held a festival; and they went into <f>ⓒ</f>the house of their god and ate and drank and reviled Abimelech.
Judges 9-28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, <f>ⓓ</f>“Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of <f>ⓔ</f>Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?
Judges 9-29 Would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. I would say <f>[1]</f> to Abimelech, ‘Increase your army, and come out.’”
Judges 9-30 <pb/>When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
Judges 9-31 And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, <f>[2]</f> saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up <f>[3]</f> the city against you.
Judges 9-32 Now therefore, go by night, you and the people who are with you, and set an ambush in the field.
Judges 9-33 Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city. And when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may do to them <f>ⓕ</f>as your hand finds to do.”
Judges 9-34 <pb/>So Abimelech and all the men who were with him rose up by night and set an ambush against Shechem in four companies.
Judges 9-35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from the ambush.
Judges 9-36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from <f>ⓖ</f>the mountaintops!” And Zebul said to him, “You mistake <f>[4]</f> the shadow of the mountains for men.”
Judges 9-37 Gaal spoke again and said, “Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners' Oak.”
Judges 9-38 Then Zebul said to him, “Where is your mouth now, you who said, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them.”
Judges 9-39 And Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
Judges 9-40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. And many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate.
Judges 9-41 And Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives, so that they could not dwell at Shechem.
Judges 9-42 <pb/>On the following day, the people went out into the field, and Abimelech was told.
Judges 9-43 He took his people and divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. And he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. So he rose against them and killed them.
Judges 9-44 Abimelech and the company that was with him <f>ⓘ</f>rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field and killed them.
Judges 9-45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed the people who were in it, and <f>ⓙ</f>he razed the city and <f>ⓚ</f>sowed it with salt.
Judges 9-46 <pb/>When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered <f>ⓛ</f>the stronghold of the house of <f>ⓜ</f>El-berith.
Judges 9-47 Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together.
Judges 9-48 And Abimelech went up to Mount <f>ⓝ</f>Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men who were with him, “What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done.”
Judges 9-49 So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against <f>ⓞ</f>the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about 1,000 men and women.
Judges 9-50 <pb/>Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and captured it.
Judges 9-51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in, and they went up to the roof of the tower.
Judges 9-52 And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
Judges 9-53 <f>ⓟ</f> And a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech's head and crushed his skull.
Judges 9-54 <f>ⓠ</f> Then he called quickly to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
Judges 9-55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone departed to his home.
Judges 9-56 <f>ⓡ</f> Thus God returned the evil of Abimelech, which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers.
Judges 9-57 And God also made all the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads, and upon them came <f>ⓢ</f>the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

Matthew 21-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to <f>ⓑ</f>the Mount of Olives, then Jesus <f>ⓒ</f>sent two disciples,
Matthew 21-2 saying to them, <J>“Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.</J>
Matthew 21-3 <J>If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.”</J>
Matthew 21-4 This took place <f>ⓓ</f>to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,
Matthew 21-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “Say to the daughter of Zion, </t><t>‘Behold, your king is coming to you, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>humble, and mounted on a donkey, </t><t>on a colt, <f>[1]</f> the foal of a beast of burden.’” </t>
Matthew 21-6 <pb/>The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
Matthew 21-7 They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them.
Matthew 21-8 Most of the crowd <f>ⓖ</f>spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Matthew 21-9 And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, <f>ⓗ</f>“Hosanna to <f>ⓘ</f>the Son of David! <f>ⓙ</f>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna <f>ⓚ</f>in the highest!”
Matthew 21-10 And <f>ⓛ</f>when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”
Matthew 21-11 And the crowds said, “This is <f>ⓜ</f>the prophet Jesus, <f>ⓝ</f>from Nazareth of Galilee.”
Matthew 21-12 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> And Jesus entered the temple <f>[2]</f> and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of <f>ⓟ</f>the money-changers and the seats of those who sold <f>ⓠ</f>pigeons.
Matthew 21-13 He said to them, <J>“It is written, <f>ⓡ</f>‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but <f>ⓢ</f>you make it a den of robbers.”</J>
Matthew 21-14 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
Matthew 21-15 <f>ⓤ</f> But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, <f>ⓥ</f>“Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant,
Matthew 21-16 and they said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” And Jesus said to them, <J>“Yes; <f>ⓦ</f>have you never read,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓧ</f>“‘Out of the mouth of <f>ⓨ</f>infants and nursing babies</J> </t><t><J>you have prepared praise’?”</J> </t>
Matthew 21-17 <pb/>And <f>ⓩ</f>leaving them, he <f>ⓐ</f>went out of the city to <f>ⓑ</f>Bethany and lodged there.
Matthew 21-18 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> In the morning, as he was returning to the city, <f>ⓓ</f>he became hungry.
Matthew 21-19 <f>ⓔ</f> And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, <J>“May no fruit ever come from you again!”</J> And the fig tree withered at once.
Matthew 21-20 <pb/>When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”
Matthew 21-21 And Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓖ</f>if you have faith and <f>ⓗ</f>do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, <f>ⓘ</f>‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.</J>
Matthew 21-22 <J>And <f>ⓙ</f>whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, <f>ⓚ</f>if you have faith.”</J>
Matthew 21-23 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him <f>ⓜ</f>as he was teaching, and said, <f>ⓝ</f>“By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”
Matthew 21-24 Jesus answered them, <J>“I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</J>
Matthew 21-25 <J>The baptism of John, <f>ⓞ</f>from where did it come? <f>ⓟ</f>From heaven or from man?”</J> And they discussed it among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Why then did you not believe him?’
Matthew 21-26 But if we say, ‘From man,’ <f>ⓡ</f>we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was <f>ⓢ</f>a prophet.”
Matthew 21-27 So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, <J>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</J>
Matthew 21-28 <pb/><J><f>ⓣ</f> “What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in <f>ⓤ</f>the vineyard today.’</J>
Matthew 21-29 <J>And he answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he <f>ⓥ</f>changed his mind and went.</J>
Matthew 21-30 <J>And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but did not go.</J>
Matthew 21-31 <J>Which of the two did the will of his father?”</J> They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, <J>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓦ</f>the tax collectors and <f>ⓧ</f>the prostitutes go into <f>ⓨ</f>the kingdom of God before you.</J>
Matthew 21-32 <J>For John came to you <f>ⓩ</f>in the way of righteousness, and <f>ⓐ</f>you did not believe him, but <f>ⓑ</f>the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward <f>ⓒ</f>change your minds and believe him.</J>

Matthew 21-36 <J><f>ⓛ</f> Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them.</J>
Matthew 21-37 <J>Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</J>
Matthew 21-38 <J>But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, <f>ⓜ</f>‘This is the heir. Come, <f>ⓝ</f>let us kill him and have his inheritance.’</J>
Matthew 21-39 <J>And they took him and <f>ⓞ</f>threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</J>
Matthew 21-40 <J><f>ⓟ</f> When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”</J>
Matthew 21-41 They said to him, <f>ⓠ</f>“He will put those wretches to a miserable death and <f>ⓡ</f>let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.”
Matthew 21-42 <pb/>Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“Have you never read in the Scriptures:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓣ</f>“‘The stone that the builders rejected</J> </t><t><J>has become the cornerstone; <f>[4]</f></J> </t><t><J>this was the Lord's doing,</J> </t><t><J>and it is marvelous in our eyes’?</J> </t>
