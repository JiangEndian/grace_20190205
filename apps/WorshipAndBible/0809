13-1 <pb/>“If a prophet or <f>ⓐ</f>a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder,
13-2 and <f>ⓑ</f>the sign or wonder that he tells you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us go after other gods,’ which you have not known, ‘and let us serve them,’
13-3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams. For the LORD your God <f>ⓒ</f>is testing you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
13-4 You shall <f>ⓓ</f>walk after the LORD your God and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice, and you shall serve him and <f>ⓔ</f>hold fast to him.
13-5 But <f>ⓕ</f>that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slavery, to make you leave the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk. <f>ⓖ</f>So you shall purge the evil <f>[1]</f> from your midst.
13-6 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> “If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or <f>ⓘ</f>the wife you embrace <f>[2]</f> or your friend <f>ⓙ</f>who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ <f>ⓚ</f>which neither you nor your fathers have known,
13-7 some <f>ⓛ</f>of the gods of the peoples who are around you, whether near you or far off from you, from the one end of the earth to the other,
13-8 you shall <f>ⓜ</f>not yield to him or listen to him, nor <f>ⓝ</f>shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him.
13-9 But you shall kill him. <f>ⓞ</f>Your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.
13-10 <f>ⓟ</f> You shall stone him to death with stones, because he sought to draw you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
13-11 And <f>ⓠ</f>all Israel shall hear and fear and never again do any such wickedness as this among you.
13-12 <pb/>“If you hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you to dwell there,
13-13 that certain <f>ⓡ</f>worthless fellows have gone out among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which you have not known,
13-14 then you shall inquire and make search and ask <f>ⓢ</f>diligently. And behold, if it be true and certain that such an abomination has been done among you,
13-15 you shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword, devoting it to destruction, <f>[3]</f> all who are in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword.
13-16 You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its open square and <f>ⓣ</f>burn the city and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It shall be a <f>ⓤ</f>heap forever. It shall not be built again.
13-17 <f>ⓥ</f> None of the devoted things shall stick to your hand, <f>ⓦ</f>that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you mercy and have compassion on you and multiply you, <f>ⓧ</f>as he swore to your fathers,
13-18 if you obey the voice of the LORD your God, <f>ⓨ</f>keeping all his commandments that I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the sight of the LORD your God.
53-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” </t><t>They are corrupt, doing abominable iniquity; </t><t>there is none who does good. </t>
53-2 <pb/><t>God looks down from heaven </t><t>on the children of man </t><t>to see if there are any who understand, <f>[2]</f> </t><t>who seek after God. </t>
53-3 <pb/><t>They have all fallen away; </t><t>together they have become corrupt; </t><t>there is none who does good, </t><t>not even one. </t>
53-4 <pb/><t>Have those who work evil no knowledge, </t><t>who eat up my people as they eat bread, </t><t>and do not call upon God? </t>
53-5 <pb/><t>There they are, in great terror, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>where there is no terror! </t><t>For God <f>ⓓ</f>scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; </t><t>you put them to shame, for God has rejected them. </t>
53-6 <pb/><t>Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! </t><t>When God restores the fortunes of his people, </t><t>let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. </t>
3-1 <pb/><t>And I said: </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>Hear, you heads of Jacob </t><t>and rulers of the house of Israel! </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>Is it not for you to know justice? — </t>
3-2 <t>you <f>ⓒ</f>who hate the good and love the evil, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>who tear the skin from off my people <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and their flesh from off their bones,</t>
3-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> who eat the flesh of my people, </t><t>and flay their skin from off them, </t><t>and break their bones in pieces </t><t>and chop them up like meat in a pot, </t><t>like flesh in a cauldron. </t>
3-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> Then they will cry to the LORD, </t><t>but he will not answer them; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>he will hide his face from them at that time, </t><t>because they have made their deeds evil. </t>
3-5 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD concerning <f>ⓗ</f>the prophets </t><t>who lead my people astray, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>who cry “Peace” </t><t>when they have something to eat, </t><t>but declare war against him </t><t>who puts nothing into their mouths.</t>
3-6 <t>Therefore <f>ⓙ</f>it shall be night to you, without vision, </t><t>and darkness to you, without divination. </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>The sun shall go down on the prophets, </t><t>and the day shall be black over them;</t>
3-7 <t><f>ⓛ</f> the seers shall be disgraced, </t><t>and the diviners put to shame; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>they shall all cover their lips, </t><t>for <f>ⓝ</f>there is no answer from God.</t>
3-8 <t>But as for me, <f>ⓞ</f>I am filled with power, </t><t>with the Spirit of the LORD, </t><t>and with justice and might, </t><t>to declare to Jacob <f>ⓟ</f>his transgression </t><t>and to Israel his sin. </t>
3-9 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob </t><t>and rulers of the house of Israel, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>who detest justice </t><t>and make crooked all that is straight,</t>
3-10 <t><f>ⓢ</f> who build Zion with blood </t><t>and Jerusalem with iniquity.</t>
3-11 <t><f>ⓣ</f> Its heads give judgment for a bribe; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>its priests teach for a price; </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>its prophets practice divination for money; </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>yet they lean on the LORD and <f>ⓧ</f>say, </t><t>“Is not the LORD in the midst of us? </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>No disaster shall come upon us.”</t>
3-12 <t>Therefore because of you </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>Zion shall be plowed as a field; </t><t>Jerusalem <f>ⓐ</f>shall become a heap of ruins, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>the mountain of the house <f>ⓒ</f>a wooded height. </t>
