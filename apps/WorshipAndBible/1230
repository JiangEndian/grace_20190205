18-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> After many days the word of the LORD came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth.”
18-2 So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.
18-3 And Ahab called Obadiah, who was <f>ⓑ</f>over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly,
18-4 and <f>ⓒ</f>when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.)
18-5 And Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.”
18-6 So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.
18-7 <pb/>And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”
18-8 And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’”
18-9 And he said, “How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
18-10 <f>ⓓ</f> As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, ‘He is not here,’ he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you.
18-11 And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’
18-12 And as soon as I have gone from you, <f>ⓔ</f>the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth.
18-13 Has it not been told my lord what I did <f>ⓕ</f>when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water?
18-14 And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here”’; and he will kill me.”
18-15 And Elijah said, <f>ⓖ</f>“As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.”
18-16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.
18-17 <pb/>When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, <f>ⓗ</f>“Is it you, you <f>ⓘ</f>troubler of Israel?”
18-18 And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father's house, because you have <f>ⓙ</f>abandoned the commandments of the LORD and <f>ⓚ</f>followed the Baals.
18-19 Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount <f>ⓛ</f>Carmel, and the <f>ⓜ</f>450 prophets of Baal and <f>ⓝ</f>the 400 prophets of Asherah, <f>ⓞ</f>who eat at Jezebel's table.”
18-20 <pb/>So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
18-21 And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long <f>ⓟ</f>will you go limping between two different opinions? <f>ⓠ</f>If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word.
18-22 Then Elijah said to the people, <f>ⓡ</f>“I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal's prophets are <f>ⓢ</f>450 men.
18-23 Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it.
18-24 And you call upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of the LORD, and the God who <f>ⓣ</f>answers by fire, he is God.” And all the people answered, “It is well spoken.”
18-25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it.”
18-26 And they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made.
18-27 And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.”
18-28 And they cried aloud and <f>ⓤ</f>cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them.
18-29 And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of <f>ⓥ</f>the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.
18-30 <pb/>Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been <f>ⓦ</f>thrown down.
18-31 Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, <f>ⓧ</f>“Israel shall be your name,”
18-32 and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs <f>[1]</f> of seed.
18-33 <f>ⓨ</f> And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, “Fill four jars with water and <f>ⓩ</f>pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.”
18-34 And he said, “Do it a second time.” And they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time.” And they did it a third time.
18-35 And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.
18-36 <pb/>And at the time of <f>ⓐ</f>the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “O LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that <f>ⓒ</f>you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that <f>ⓓ</f>I have done all these things at your word.
18-37 Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.”
18-38 <f>ⓔ</f> Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
18-39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, <f>ⓕ</f>“The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.”
18-40 And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to <f>ⓖ</f>the brook Kishon and <f>ⓗ</f>slaughtered them there.
18-41 <pb/>And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.”
18-42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel. <f>ⓘ</f>And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees.
18-43 And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” And he went up and looked and said, “There is nothing.” And he said, “Go again,” seven times.
18-44 And at the seventh time he said, “Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>a little cloud like a man's hand is rising from the sea.” And he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.’”
18-45 And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to <f>ⓚ</f>Jezreel.
18-46 <f>ⓛ</f> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, <f>ⓜ</f>and he gathered up his garment and ran before Ahab to the entrance of <f>ⓝ</f>Jezreel.
3-1 <pb/><t>On my bed <f>ⓐ</f>by night </t><t>I sought <f>ⓑ</f>him whom my soul loves; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>I sought him, but found him not.</t>
3-2 <t>I will rise now and go about the city, </t><t>in <f>ⓓ</f>the streets and in the squares; </t><t>I will seek <f>ⓔ</f>him whom my soul loves. </t><t>I sought him, but found him not.</t>
3-3 <t><f>ⓕ</f> The watchmen found me </t><t>as they went about in the city. </t><t>“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”</t>
3-4 <t>Scarcely had I passed them </t><t>when I found <f>ⓖ</f>him whom my soul loves. </t><t>I <f>ⓗ</f>held him, and would not let him go </t><t>until I had <f>ⓘ</f>brought him into my mother's house, </t><t>and into the chamber of <f>ⓙ</f>her who conceived me.</t>
3-5 <t><f>ⓚ</f> I adjure you, <f>ⓛ</f>O daughters of Jerusalem, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>by the gazelles or the does of the field, </t><t>that you not stir up or awaken love </t><t>until it pleases. </t>
3-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> What is that coming up from the wilderness </t><t>like <f>ⓞ</f>columns of smoke, </t><t>perfumed with <f>ⓟ</f>myrrh and frankincense, </t><t>with all the fragrant powders of a merchant?</t>
3-7 <t>Behold, it is the litter <f>[1]</f> of Solomon! </t><t>Around it are <f>ⓠ</f>sixty <f>ⓡ</f>mighty men, </t><t>some of the mighty men of Israel,</t>
3-8 <t>all of them wearing swords </t><t>and expert in war, </t><t>each with his <f>ⓢ</f>sword at his thigh, </t><t>against <f>ⓣ</f>terror by night.</t>
3-9 <t>King Solomon made himself a carriage <f>[2]</f> </t><t>from the wood of Lebanon.</t>
3-10 <t>He made its posts of silver, </t><t>its back of gold, its seat of purple; </t><t>its interior was inlaid with love </t><t>by <f>ⓤ</f>the daughters of Jerusalem.</t>
3-11 <t>Go out, O <f>ⓥ</f>daughters of Zion, </t><t>and look upon King Solomon, </t><t>with the crown with which his mother crowned him </t><t>on <f>ⓦ</f>the day of his wedding, </t><t>on the day of the gladness of his heart. </t>
21-1 <pb/>And when <f>ⓐ</f>we had parted from them and set sail, we <f>ⓑ</f>came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. <f>[1]</f>
21-2 And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
21-3 When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload its cargo.
21-4 And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And <f>ⓒ</f>through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
21-5 When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, <f>ⓓ</f>accompanied us until we were outside the city. And <f>ⓔ</f>kneeling down on the beach, we prayed
21-6 and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.
21-7 <pb/>When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted <f>ⓕ</f>the brothers <f>[2]</f> and stayed with them for one day.
21-8 On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of <f>ⓖ</f>Philip <f>ⓗ</f>the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
21-9 He had four unmarried daughters, <f>ⓘ</f>who prophesied.
21-10 While we were staying for many days, a prophet named <f>ⓙ</f>Agabus came down from Judea.
21-11 And coming to us, he <f>ⓚ</f>took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, <f>ⓛ</f>“Thus says the Holy Spirit, <f>ⓜ</f>‘This is how the Jews <f>[3]</f> at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and <f>ⓝ</f>deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’”
21-12 When we heard this, we and the people there <f>ⓞ</f>urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
21-13 Then Paul answered, <f>ⓟ</f>“What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For <f>ⓠ</f>I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem <f>ⓡ</f>for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
21-14 And since he would not be persuaded, <f>ⓢ</f>we ceased and said, <f>ⓣ</f>“Let the will of the Lord be done.”
21-15 <pb/>After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
21-16 And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
21-17 <pb/>When we had come to Jerusalem, <f>ⓤ</f>the brothers received us gladly.
21-18 On the following day Paul went in with us to <f>ⓥ</f>James, and all <f>ⓦ</f>the elders were present.
21-19 After greeting them, <f>ⓧ</f>he related one by one <f>ⓨ</f>the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his <f>ⓩ</f>ministry.
21-20 And when they heard it, they <f>ⓐ</f>glorified God. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all <f>ⓑ</f>zealous for the law,
21-21 and they have been told about you that you teach all <f>ⓒ</f>the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, <f>ⓓ</f>telling them <f>ⓔ</f>not to circumcise their children or <f>ⓕ</f>walk according to <f>ⓖ</f>our customs.
21-22 What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.
21-23 Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men <f>ⓗ</f>who are under a vow;
21-24 take these men and <f>ⓘ</f>purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, <f>ⓙ</f>so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law.
21-25 But as for the Gentiles who have believed, <f>ⓚ</f>we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, <f>[4]</f> and from sexual immorality.”
21-26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day <f>ⓛ</f>he purified himself along with them and <f>ⓜ</f>went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and <f>ⓝ</f>the offering presented for each one of them.
21-27 <pb/>When <f>ⓞ</f>the seven days were almost completed, <f>ⓟ</f>the Jews from Asia, <f>ⓠ</f>seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,
21-28 crying out, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who <f>ⓡ</f>is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and <f>ⓢ</f>the law and <f>ⓣ</f>this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and <f>ⓤ</f>has defiled <f>ⓥ</f>this holy place.”
21-29 For they had previously seen <f>ⓦ</f>Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
21-30 Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and <f>ⓧ</f>dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut.
21-31 <f>ⓨ</f> And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of <f>ⓩ</f>the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
21-32 <f>ⓐ</f> He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
21-33 Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him <f>ⓑ</f>to be bound <f>ⓒ</f>with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.
21-34 <f>ⓓ</f> Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into <f>ⓔ</f>the barracks.
21-35 And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,
21-36 for the mob of the people followed, crying out, <f>ⓕ</f>“Away with him!”
21-37 <pb/>As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?” And he said, “Do you know Greek?
21-38 Are you not <f>ⓖ</f>the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out <f>ⓗ</f>into the wilderness?”
21-39 Paul replied, <f>ⓘ</f>“I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.”
21-40 And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, <f>ⓙ</f>motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in <f>ⓚ</f>the Hebrew language, <f>[5]</f> saying:
