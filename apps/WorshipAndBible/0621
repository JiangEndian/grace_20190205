Leviticus 27-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 27-2 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, If anyone <f>ⓐ</f>makes a special vow to the LORD involving the valuation of persons,
Leviticus 27-3 then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels <f>[1]</f> of silver, according to the <f>ⓑ</f>shekel of the sanctuary.
Leviticus 27-4 If the person is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels.
Leviticus 27-5 If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels.
Leviticus 27-6 If the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver.
Leviticus 27-7 And if the person is sixty years old or over, then the valuation for a male shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.
Leviticus 27-8 And if someone is too poor to pay the valuation, then he shall be made to stand before the priest, and the priest shall value him; the priest shall value him according to what the vower can afford.
Leviticus 27-9 <pb/>“If the vow <f>[2]</f> is an animal that may be offered as an offering to the LORD, all of it that he gives to the LORD is holy.
Leviticus 27-10 <f>ⓒ</f> He shall not exchange it or make a substitute for it, good for bad, or bad for good; and if he does in fact substitute one animal for another, then both it and the substitute shall be holy.
Leviticus 27-11 And if it is any unclean animal that may not be offered as an offering to the LORD, then he shall stand the animal before the priest,
Leviticus 27-12 and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall be.
Leviticus 27-13 <f>ⓓ</f> But if he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a <f>ⓔ</f>fifth to the valuation.
Leviticus 27-14 <pb/>“When a man dedicates his house as a holy gift to the LORD, the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand.
Leviticus 27-15 <f>ⓕ</f> And if the donor wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a <f>ⓖ</f>fifth to the valuation price, and it shall be his.
Leviticus 27-16 <pb/>“If a man dedicates to the LORD part of the land that is his possession, then the valuation shall be in proportion to its seed. A homer <f>[3]</f> of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus 27-17 If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, the valuation shall stand,
Leviticus 27-18 but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall <f>ⓗ</f>calculate the price according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from the valuation.
Leviticus 27-19 <f>ⓘ</f> And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a <f>ⓙ</f>fifth to its valuation price, and it shall remain his.
Leviticus 27-20 But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore.
Leviticus 27-21 But the field, <f>ⓚ</f>when it is released in the jubilee, shall be a holy gift to the LORD, like a field that has been <f>ⓛ</f>devoted. The priest shall be in <f>ⓜ</f>possession of it.
Leviticus 27-22 If he dedicates to the LORD a field that he has bought, <f>ⓝ</f>which is not a part of his possession,
Leviticus 27-23 <f>ⓞ</f> then the priest shall calculate the amount of the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give the valuation on that day as a holy gift to the LORD.
Leviticus 27-24 <f>ⓟ</f> In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to whom the land belongs as a possession.
Leviticus 27-25 Every valuation shall be according to <f>ⓠ</f>the shekel of the sanctuary: <f>ⓡ</f>twenty gerahs <f>[4]</f> shall make a shekel.
Leviticus 27-26 <pb/>“But a <f>ⓢ</f>firstborn of animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may dedicate; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD's.
Leviticus 27-27 And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back at the valuation, <f>ⓣ</f>and add a fifth to it; or, if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at the valuation.
Leviticus 27-28 <pb/>“But <f>ⓤ</f>no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD, of anything that he has, whether man or beast, or of his inherited field, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
Leviticus 27-29 <f>ⓥ</f> No one devoted, who is to be devoted for destruction <f>[5]</f> from mankind, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus 27-30 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> “Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD.
Leviticus 27-31 If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it.
Leviticus 27-32 And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that <f>ⓧ</f>pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the LORD.
Leviticus 27-33 One shall not differentiate between good or bad, <f>ⓨ</f>neither shall he make a substitute for it; and if he does substitute for it, then both it and the substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.”
