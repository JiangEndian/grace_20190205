23-1 <pb/>Now they told David, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against <f>ⓐ</f>Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors.”
23-2 Therefore David <f>ⓑ</f>inquired of the LORD, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And the LORD said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”
23-3 But David's men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
23-4 Then David <f>ⓒ</f>inquired of the LORD again. And the LORD answered him, “Arise, go down to Keilah, <f>ⓓ</f>for I will give the Philistines into your hand.”
23-5 And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and struck them with a great blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
23-6 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech had fled to David to Keilah, he had come down with an ephod in his hand.
23-7 Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, “God has given him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.”
23-8 And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
23-9 David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him. And he said to Abiathar the priest, <f>ⓕ</f>“Bring the ephod here.”
23-10 Then David said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account.
23-11 Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, the God of Israel, please tell your servant.” And the LORD said, “He will come down.”
23-12 Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And the LORD said, <f>ⓖ</f>“They will surrender you.”
23-13 Then David and his men, <f>ⓗ</f>who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went <f>ⓘ</f>wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition.
23-14 And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country <f>ⓙ</f>of the wilderness of <f>ⓚ</f>Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
23-15 <pb/>David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
23-16 And Jonathan, Saul's son, rose and went to David at Horesh, and strengthened his hand in God.
23-17 And he said to him, “Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. <f>ⓛ</f>Saul my father also knows this.”
23-18 <f>ⓜ</f> And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.
23-19 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of <f>ⓞ</f>Jeshimon?
23-20 Now come down, O king, according to all your heart's desire to come down, <f>ⓟ</f>and our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand.”
23-21 And Saul said, <f>ⓠ</f>“May you be blessed by the LORD, <f>ⓡ</f>for you have had compassion on me.
23-22 Go, make yet more sure. Know and see the place where his foot is, and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he is very cunning.
23-23 See therefore and take note of all the lurking places where he hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you. And if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”
23-24 And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. <pb/>Now David and his men were <f>ⓢ</f>in the wilderness of Maon, <f>ⓣ</f>in the Arabah to the south of <f>ⓤ</f>Jeshimon.
23-25 And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told, so he went down to the rock and lived in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
23-26 Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David was hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them,
23-27 a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid against the land.”
23-28 So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape. <f>[1]</f>
23-29 <f>[2]</f> And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of <f>ⓥ</f>Engedi.

146-4 <t>When <f>ⓖ</f>his breath departs, he returns to the earth; </t><t>on that very day his plans perish. </t>

16-1 <pb/>He also said to the disciples, <J>“There was a rich man who had <f>ⓐ</f>a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions.</J>
16-2 <J>And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your <f>ⓑ</f>management, for you can no longer be manager.’</J>
16-3 <J>And the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</J>
16-4 <J>I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.’</J>
16-5 <J>So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</J>
16-6 <J>He said, ‘A hundred measures <f>[1]</f> of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’</J>
16-7 <J>Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred measures <f>[2]</f> of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’</J>
16-8 <J>The master commended the dishonest manager for his <f>ⓒ</f>shrewdness. For <f>ⓓ</f>the sons of this world <f>[3]</f> are <f>ⓔ</f>more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than <f>ⓕ</f>the sons of light.</J>
16-9 <J>And I tell you, <f>ⓖ</f>make friends for yourselves by means of <f>ⓗ</f>unrighteous wealth, <f>[4]</f> so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</J>
16-10 <pb/><J><f>ⓘ</f> “One who is <f>ⓙ</f>faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.</J>
16-11 <J>If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?</J>
16-12 <J>And if you have not been faithful in <f>ⓚ</f>that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?</J>
16-13 <J><f>ⓛ</f> No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”</J>
16-14 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> The Pharisees, who were <f>ⓝ</f>lovers of money, heard all these things, and they <f>ⓞ</f>ridiculed him.
16-15 And he said to them, <J>“You are those who <f>ⓟ</f>justify yourselves before men, but <f>ⓠ</f>God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men <f>ⓡ</f>is an abomination in the sight of God.</J>
16-16 <pb/><J><f>ⓢ</f> “The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then <f>ⓣ</f>the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and <f>ⓤ</f>everyone forces his way into it. <f>[5]</f></J>

16-18 <pb/><J><f>ⓦ</f> “Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.</J>
16-19 <pb/><J>“There was a rich man who was clothed in <f>ⓧ</f>purple and fine linen and <f>ⓨ</f>who feasted sumptuously every day.</J>
16-20 <J>And at his gate <f>ⓩ</f>was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,</J>
16-21 <J>who desired to be fed with <f>ⓐ</f>what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.</J>
16-22 <J>The poor man died and was carried by <f>ⓑ</f>the angels <f>ⓒ</f>to Abraham's side. <f>[6]</f> The rich man also died and was buried,</J>
16-23 <J>and in <f>ⓓ</f>Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and <f>ⓔ</f>saw Abraham far off and Lazarus <f>ⓕ</f>at his side.</J>
16-24 <J>And he called out, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and <f>ⓗ</f>cool my tongue, for <f>ⓘ</f>I am in anguish in this flame.’</J>
16-25 <J>But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that <f>ⓙ</f>you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.</J>
16-26 <J>And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’</J>
16-27 <J>And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house — </J>
16-28 <J>for I have five brothers — so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’</J>
16-29 <J>But Abraham said, ‘They have <f>ⓚ</f>Moses and the Prophets; <f>ⓛ</f>let them hear them.’</J>
16-30 <J>And he said, ‘No, <f>ⓜ</f>father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’</J>
16-31 <J>He said to him, ‘If they do not hear <f>ⓝ</f>Moses and the Prophets, <f>ⓞ</f>neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’”</J>
