15-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
15-2 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, <f>ⓐ</f>When you come into the land you are to inhabit, which I am giving you,
15-3 and <f>ⓑ</f>you offer to the LORD from the herd or from the flock a food offering <f>[1]</f> or a burnt offering or a sacrifice, <f>ⓒ</f>to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or <f>ⓓ</f>at your appointed feasts, to make a <f>ⓔ</f>pleasing aroma to the LORD,
15-4 then <f>ⓕ</f>he who brings his offering shall offer to the LORD <f>ⓖ</f>a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah <f>[2]</f> of fine flour, <f>ⓗ</f>mixed with a quarter of a hin <f>[3]</f> of oil;
15-5 and you shall offer with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice, a quarter of a hin of <f>ⓘ</f>wine for the drink offering for each lamb.
15-6 <f>ⓙ</f> Or for a ram, you shall offer for a grain offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil.
15-7 And for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine, a <f>ⓚ</f>pleasing aroma to the LORD.
15-8 And when you offer a bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, to <f>ⓛ</f>fulfill a vow or for <f>ⓜ</f>peace offerings to the LORD,
15-9 then one shall offer <f>ⓝ</f>with the bull a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with half a hin of oil.
15-10 And you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
15-11 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> “Thus it shall be done for each bull or ram, or for each lamb or young goat.
15-12 As many as you offer, so shall you do with each one, as many as there are.
15-13 Every native Israelite shall do these things in this way, in offering a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
15-14 And if a stranger is sojourning with you, or anyone is living permanently among you, and he wishes to offer a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he shall do as you do.
15-15 For the assembly, <f>ⓟ</f>there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you, a statute forever throughout your generations. You and the sojourner shall be alike before the LORD.
15-16 One law and one rule shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.”
15-17 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
15-18 <f>ⓠ</f> “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land to which I bring you
15-19 and when you eat of <f>ⓡ</f>the bread of the land, you shall present a contribution to the LORD.
15-20 <f>ⓢ</f> Of the first of your dough you shall present a loaf as a contribution; like a <f>ⓣ</f>contribution from the threshing floor, so shall you present it.
15-21 <f>ⓤ</f> Some of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD as a contribution throughout your generations.
15-22 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> “But if you sin unintentionally, <f>[4]</f> and do not observe all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses,
15-23 all that the LORD has commanded you by Moses, from the day that the LORD gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations,
15-24 then if it was done unintentionally <f>ⓦ</f>without the knowledge of the congregation, all the congregation shall offer one bull from the herd for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD, <f>ⓧ</f>with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the rule, and <f>ⓨ</f>one male goat for a sin offering.
15-25 <f>ⓩ</f> And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the people of Israel, and they shall be forgiven, because it was a mistake, and they have brought their offering, a food offering to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD for their mistake.
15-26 And all the congregation of the people of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who sojourns among them, because the whole population was involved in the mistake.
15-27 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “If one person sins unintentionally, he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.
15-28 <f>ⓑ</f> And the priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who makes a mistake, when he sins unintentionally, to make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
15-29 <f>ⓒ</f> You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among the people of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them.
15-30 <f>ⓓ</f> But the person who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native or a sojourner, reviles the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from among his people.
15-31 Because he has <f>ⓔ</f>despised the word of the LORD and has broken his commandment, that person shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.”
15-32 <pb/>While the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man <f>ⓕ</f>gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.
15-33 And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation.
15-34 <f>ⓖ</f> They put him in custody, because it had not been made clear what should be done to him.
15-35 And the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓗ</f>“The man shall be put to death; all the congregation shall <f>ⓘ</f>stone him with stones outside the camp.”
15-36 And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, as the LORD commanded Moses.
15-37 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses,
15-38 “Speak to the people of Israel, and tell them to <f>ⓙ</f>make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a cord of blue on the tassel of each corner.
15-39 And it shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, to do them, <f>ⓚ</f>not to follow <f>[5]</f> after your own heart and your own eyes, which you are inclined <f>ⓛ</f>to whore after.
15-40 So you shall remember and do all my commandments, and be <f>ⓜ</f>holy to your God.
15-41 <f>ⓝ</f> I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am the LORD your God.”
19-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> The heavens declare the glory of God, </t><t>and the sky above <f>[1]</f> proclaims his handiwork.</t>
19-2 <t>Day to day pours out speech, </t><t>and night to night reveals knowledge.</t>
19-3 <t>There is no speech, nor are there words, </t><t>whose voice is not heard.</t>
19-4 <t><f>ⓑ</f> Their <f>ⓒ</f>voice <f>[2]</f> goes out through all the earth, </t><t>and their words to the end of the world. </t><t>In them he has set a tent for <f>ⓓ</f>the sun,</t>
19-5 <t><f>ⓔ</f> which comes out like <f>ⓕ</f>a bridegroom leaving his chamber, </t><t>and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.</t>
19-6 <t>Its rising is from the end of the heavens, </t><t>and its circuit to the end of them, </t><t>and there is nothing hidden from its heat. </t>
19-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> The law of the LORD is perfect, <f>[3]</f> </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>reviving the soul; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>the testimony of the LORD is <f>ⓙ</f>sure, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>making wise <f>ⓛ</f>the simple;</t>
19-8 <t><f>ⓜ</f> the precepts of the LORD are right, </t><t>rejoicing the heart; </t><t>the commandment of the LORD is <f>ⓝ</f>pure, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>enlightening the eyes;</t>
19-9 <t>the fear of the LORD is clean, </t><t>enduring forever; </t><t>the rules <f>[4]</f> of the LORD are <f>ⓟ</f>true, </t><t>and righteous altogether.</t>
19-10 <t>More to be desired are they than <f>ⓠ</f>gold, </t><t>even much <f>ⓡ</f>fine gold; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>sweeter also than honey </t><t>and drippings of <f>ⓣ</f>the honeycomb.</t>
19-11 <t>Moreover, by them is your servant warned; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>in keeping them there is great reward. </t>
19-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f> Who can discern his errors? </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>Declare me innocent from <f>ⓧ</f>hidden faults.</t>
19-13 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Keep back your servant also from <f>ⓩ</f>presumptuous sins; </t><t>let them not have <f>ⓐ</f>dominion over me! </t><t>Then I shall be blameless, </t><t>and innocent of great transgression. </t>
19-14 <pb/><t>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart </t><t>be acceptable in your sight, </t><t>O LORD, my <f>ⓑ</f>rock and my <f>ⓒ</f>redeemer. </t>
12-1 <pb/>“At that time shall arise <f>ⓐ</f>Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And <f>ⓑ</f>there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, <f>ⓒ</f>everyone whose name shall be found written in the book.
12-2 And many of those who <f>ⓓ</f>sleep in <f>ⓔ</f>the dust of the earth shall <f>ⓕ</f>awake, <f>ⓖ</f>some to everlasting life, and <f>ⓗ</f>some to shame and everlasting contempt.
12-3 <f>ⓘ</f> And those who are wise <f>ⓙ</f>shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓚ</f>those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
12-4 But you, Daniel, <f>ⓛ</f>shut up the words and <f>ⓜ</f>seal the book, until <f>ⓝ</f>the time of the end. <f>ⓞ</f>Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.”
12-5 <pb/>Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on <f>ⓟ</f>this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream.
12-6 And someone said to <f>ⓠ</f>the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>“How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?”
12-7 And I heard <f>ⓢ</f>the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; <f>ⓣ</f>he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and <f>ⓤ</f>swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a <f>ⓥ</f>time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of <f>ⓦ</f>the power of <f>ⓧ</f>the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished.
12-8 I heard, <f>ⓨ</f>but I did not understand. Then I said, “O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?”
12-9 He said, <f>ⓩ</f>“Go your way, Daniel, <f>ⓐ</f>for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.
12-10 <f>ⓑ</f> Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but <f>ⓒ</f>the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, <f>ⓓ</f>but those who are wise shall understand.
12-11 And from the time that <f>ⓔ</f>the regular burnt offering is taken away and <f>ⓕ</f>the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be 1,290 days.
12-12 <f>ⓖ</f> Blessed is he who waits and arrives at the 1,335 days.
12-13 <f>ⓗ</f> But go your way till the end. <f>ⓘ</f>And you shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at <f>ⓙ</f>the end of the days.”
