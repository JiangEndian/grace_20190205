22-1 <pb/>David departed from there and escaped to <f>ⓐ</f>the cave of <f>ⓑ</f>Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.
22-2 <f>ⓒ</f> And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, <f>[1]</f> gathered to him. And he became commander over them. And there were with him <f>ⓓ</f>about four hundred men.
22-3 <pb/>And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother stay <f>[2]</f> with you, till I know what God will do for me.”
22-4 And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.
22-5 Then the prophet <f>ⓔ</f>Gad said to David, “Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.” So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.
22-6 <pb/>Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under <f>ⓕ</f>the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
22-7 And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, “Hear now, people of Benjamin; will the son of Jesse <f>ⓖ</f>give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,
22-8 that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me <f>ⓗ</f>when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you <f>ⓘ</f>is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, <f>ⓙ</f>to lie in wait, as at this day.”
22-9 Then answered <f>ⓚ</f>Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, “I saw the son of Jesse <f>ⓛ</f>coming to Nob, to <f>ⓜ</f>Ahimelech the son of Ahitub,
22-10 <f>ⓝ</f> and he inquired of the LORD for him and <f>ⓞ</f>gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
22-11 <pb/>Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were at Nob, and all of them came to the king.
22-12 And Saul said, “Hear now, son of Ahitub.” And he answered, “Here I am, my lord.”
22-13 And Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and <f>ⓟ</f>have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, <f>ⓠ</f>to lie in wait, as at this day?”
22-14 Then Ahimelech answered the king, “And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and captain over <f>[3]</f> your bodyguard, and honored in your house?
22-15 Is today the first time <f>ⓡ</f>that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, <f>ⓢ</f>much or little.”
22-16 And the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house.”
22-17 And the king said to <f>ⓣ</f>the guard who stood about him, “Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the LORD.
22-18 Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and strike the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests, <f>ⓤ</f>and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.
22-19 And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; <f>ⓥ</f>both man and woman, child and infant, ox, donkey and sheep, he put to the sword.
22-20 <pb/>But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named <f>ⓦ</f>Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
22-21 And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
22-22 And David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day, <f>ⓧ</f>when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house.
22-23 <f>ⓨ</f> Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. With me you shall be in safekeeping.”
145-1 <f>[1]</f> <pb/><t> <f>ⓐ</f> I will extol you, my God and <f>ⓑ</f>King, </t><t>and bless your name forever and ever.</t>
145-2 <t>Every day I will bless you </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and praise your name forever and ever.</t>
145-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, </t><t>and his <f>ⓔ</f>greatness is unsearchable. </t>
145-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> One generation shall commend your works to another, </t><t>and shall declare your mighty acts.</t>

145-7 <t>They shall pour forth the fame of your <f>ⓘ</f>abundant goodness </t><t>and shall sing aloud of your righteousness. </t>
145-8 <pb/><t>The LORD is <f>ⓙ</f>gracious and merciful, </t><t>slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.</t>

145-15 <t>The eyes of all <f>ⓣ</f>look to you, </t><t>and you give them their food in due season.</t>
145-16 <t>You <f>ⓤ</f>open your hand; </t><t>you <f>ⓥ</f>satisfy the desire of every living thing.</t>

145-18 <t>The LORD is <f>ⓨ</f>near to all who call on him, </t><t>to all who call on him <f>ⓩ</f>in truth.</t>
145-19 <t>He <f>ⓐ</f>fulfills the desire of those who fear him; </t><t>he also <f>ⓑ</f>hears their cry and saves them.</t>
145-20 <t>The LORD <f>ⓒ</f>preserves all who love him, </t><t>but all the wicked he will destroy. </t>
145-21 <pb/><t>My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever. </t>
15-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him.
15-2 And the Pharisees and the scribes <f>ⓑ</f>grumbled, saying, <f>ⓒ</f>“This man receives sinners and <f>ⓓ</f>eats with them.”
15-3 <pb/>So he told them this parable:
15-4 <J><f>ⓔ</f> “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, <f>ⓕ</f>if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine <f>ⓖ</f>in the open country, and <f>ⓗ</f>go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?</J>
15-5 <J>And when he has found it, <f>ⓘ</f>he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</J>
15-6 <J>And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for <f>ⓙ</f>I have found my sheep that was lost.’</J>
15-7 <J>Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who <f>ⓚ</f>repents than over ninety-nine <f>ⓛ</f>righteous persons who need no repentance.</J>
15-8 <pb/><J>“Or what woman, having ten silver coins, <f>[1]</f> if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?</J>
15-9 <J>And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’</J>
15-10 <J>Just so, I tell you, there is joy before <f>ⓜ</f>the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</J>
15-11 <pb/>And he said, <J>“There was a man who had two sons.</J>
15-12 <J>And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me <f>ⓝ</f>the share of property that is coming to me.’ And he divided <f>ⓞ</f>his property between them.</J>
15-13 <J>Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in <f>ⓟ</f>reckless living.</J>
15-14 <J>And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.</J>
15-15 <J>So he went and hired himself out to <f>[2]</f> one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.</J>
15-16 <J>And he <f>ⓠ</f>was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.</J>
15-17 <pb/><J>“But <f>ⓡ</f>when he <f>ⓢ</f>came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!</J>
15-18 <J>I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, <f>ⓣ</f>I have sinned against <f>ⓤ</f>heaven and before you.</J>
15-19 <J><f>ⓥ</f> I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.”’</J>
15-20 <J>And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and <f>ⓦ</f>ran and <f>ⓧ</f>embraced him and <f>ⓨ</f>kissed him.</J>
15-21 <J>And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. <f>ⓩ</f>I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ <f>[3]</f></J>
15-22 <J>But the father said to his servants, <f>[4]</f> ‘Bring quickly <f>ⓐ</f>the best robe, and put it on him, and put <f>ⓑ</f>a ring on his hand, and <f>ⓒ</f>shoes on his feet.</J>
15-23 <J>And bring <f>ⓓ</f>the fattened calf and kill it, and <f>ⓔ</f>let us eat and celebrate.</J>
15-24 <J>For this my son <f>ⓕ</f>was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.</J>
15-25 <pb/><J>“Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</J>
15-26 <J>And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</J>
15-27 <J>And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’</J>
15-28 <J>But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,</J>
15-29 <J>but he answered his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might <f>ⓖ</f>celebrate with my friends.</J>
15-30 <J>But when this son of yours came, <f>ⓗ</f>who has devoured <f>ⓘ</f>your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’</J>
15-31 <J>And he said to him, ‘Son, <f>ⓙ</f>you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.</J>
15-32 <J>It was fitting <f>ⓚ</f>to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother <f>ⓛ</f>was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.’”</J>
