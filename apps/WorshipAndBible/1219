7-1 <pb/>Solomon was <f>ⓐ</f>building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house.
7-2 <pb/>He built <f>ⓑ</f>the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was a hundred cubits <f>[1]</f> and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits, and it was built on four <f>[2]</f> rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.
7-3 And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row.
7-4 There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window in three tiers.
7-5 All the doorways and windows <f>[3]</f> had square frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.
7-6 <pb/>And he made <f>ⓒ</f>the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. There was a porch in front with pillars, and <f>ⓓ</f>a canopy in front of them.
7-7 <pb/>And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment. <f>ⓔ</f>It was finished with cedar from floor to rafters. <f>[4]</f>
7-8 <pb/>His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter <f>ⓕ</f>whom he had taken in marriage.
7-9 <pb/>All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great court.
7-10 The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits.
7-11 And above were costly stones, cut according to measurement, and cedar.
7-12 <f>ⓖ</f> The great court had three courses of cut stone all around, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the LORD and <f>ⓗ</f>the vestibule of the house.
7-13 <pb/>And King Solomon sent and brought <f>ⓘ</f>Hiram from Tyre.
7-14 He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And <f>ⓙ</f>he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and did all his work.
7-15 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> He cast <f>ⓛ</f>two pillars of bronze. <f>ⓜ</f>Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference. It was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers. The second pillar was the same. <f>[5]</f>
7-16 He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and <f>ⓝ</f>the height of the other capital was five cubits.
7-17 There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice <f>[6]</f> for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital.
7-18 Likewise he made pomegranates <f>[7]</f> in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital.
7-19 Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.
7-20 The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework. There were <f>ⓞ</f>two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital.
7-21 <f>ⓟ</f> He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz.
7-22 And on the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.
7-23 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then he made <f>ⓡ</f>the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.
7-24 Under its brim were <f>ⓢ</f>gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.
7-25 It stood on <f>ⓣ</f>twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.
7-26 Its thickness was a handbreadth, <f>[8]</f> and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths. <f>[9]</f>
7-27 <pb/>He also made the <f>ⓤ</f>ten stands of bronze. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
7-28 This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames,
7-29 and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work.
7-30 Moreover, each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each.
7-31 Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round.
7-32 And the four wheels were underneath the panels. The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.
7-33 The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.
7-34 There were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stands.
7-35 And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.
7-36 And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.
7-37 After this manner he made <f>ⓥ</f>the ten stands. All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.
7-38 <pb/>And he made <f>ⓦ</f>ten basins of bronze. Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands.
7-39 And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house. And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
7-40 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> Hiram also made <f>ⓨ</f>the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD:
7-41 the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two <f>ⓩ</f>latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;
7-42 and the <f>ⓐ</f>four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;
7-43 the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands;
7-44 and <f>ⓑ</f>the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.
7-45 <pb/>Now <f>ⓒ</f>the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the LORD, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze.
7-46 In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between <f>ⓓ</f>Succoth and <f>ⓔ</f>Zarethan.
7-47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; <f>ⓕ</f>the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.
7-48 <pb/>So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: <f>ⓖ</f>the golden altar, <f>ⓗ</f>the golden table for <f>ⓘ</f>the bread of the Presence,
7-49 <f>ⓙ</f> the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; <f>ⓚ</f>the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;
7-50 the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and <f>ⓛ</f>fire pans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, <f>ⓜ</f>the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.
7-51 <pb/>Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in <f>ⓝ</f>the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
4-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Again I <f>ⓑ</f>saw all <f>ⓒ</f>the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had <f>ⓓ</f>no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.
4-2 And I <f>ⓔ</f>thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.
4-3 But <f>ⓕ</f>better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
4-4 <pb/>Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is <f>ⓖ</f>vanity <f>[1]</f> and a striving after wind.
4-5 <pb/>The fool <f>ⓗ</f>folds his hands and <f>ⓘ</f>eats his own flesh.
4-6 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Better is a handful of <f>ⓚ</f>quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.
4-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Again, I saw vanity under the sun:
4-8 one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his <f>ⓜ</f>eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, <f>ⓝ</f>“For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity and an unhappy <f>ⓞ</f>business.
4-9 <pb/>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.
4-10 For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!
4-11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, <f>ⓟ</f>but how can one keep warm alone?
4-12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him — a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
4-13 <pb/>Better was <f>ⓠ</f>a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how <f>ⓡ</f>to take advice.
4-14 For he went <f>ⓢ</f>from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.
4-15 I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that <f>[2]</f> youth who was to stand in the king's <f>[3]</f> place.
4-16 There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is <f>ⓣ</f>vanity and a striving after wind.
10-1 <pb/>At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of <f>ⓐ</f>what was known as the Italian Cohort,
10-2 a devout man <f>ⓑ</f>who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God.
10-3 <f>ⓒ</f> About the ninth hour of the day <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>he saw clearly in a vision <f>ⓔ</f>an angel of God come in and say to him, “Cornelius.”
10-4 And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms <f>ⓕ</f>have ascended <f>ⓖ</f>as a memorial before God.
10-5 And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter.
10-6 He is lodging <f>ⓗ</f>with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
10-7 When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,
10-8 and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
10-9 <pb/>The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, <f>ⓘ</f>Peter went up <f>ⓙ</f>on the housetop about <f>ⓚ</f>the sixth hour <f>[2]</f> to pray.
10-10 And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into <f>ⓛ</f>a trance
10-11 and saw <f>ⓜ</f>the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth.
10-12 In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.
10-13 And there came a voice to him: <J>“Rise, Peter; kill and eat.”</J>
10-14 But Peter said, “By no means, Lord; <f>ⓝ</f>for I have never eaten anything that is <f>ⓞ</f>common or <f>ⓟ</f>unclean.”
10-15 And the voice came to him again a second time, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“What God has made clean, do not call common.”</J>
10-16 This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.
10-17 <pb/>Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what <f>ⓡ</f>the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, <f>ⓢ</f>the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate
10-18 and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.
10-19 And while Peter was pondering <f>ⓣ</f>the vision, <f>ⓤ</f>the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you.
10-20 Rise and go down and <f>ⓥ</f>accompany them without hesitation, <f>[3]</f> for I have sent them.”
10-21 And Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?”
10-22 And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and <f>ⓦ</f>God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by <f>ⓧ</f>a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and <f>ⓨ</f>to hear what you have to say.”
10-23 So he invited them in to be his guests. <pb/>The next day he rose and went away with them, and <f>ⓩ</f>some of <f>ⓐ</f>the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
10-24 And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
10-25 When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and <f>ⓑ</f>fell down at his feet and <f>ⓒ</f>worshiped him.
10-26 But Peter lifted him up, saying, <f>ⓓ</f>“Stand up; I too am a man.”
10-27 And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered.
10-28 And he said to them, “You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew <f>ⓔ</f>to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but <f>ⓕ</f>God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.
10-29 So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.”
10-30 <pb/>And Cornelius said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at <f>ⓗ</f>the ninth hour, <f>[4]</f> and behold, <f>ⓘ</f>a man stood before me in bright clothing
10-31 and said, ‘Cornelius, <f>ⓙ</f>your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
10-32 Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’
10-33 So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.”
10-34 <pb/>So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that <f>ⓚ</f>God <f>ⓛ</f>shows no partiality,
10-35 but <f>ⓜ</f>in every nation anyone who fears him and <f>ⓝ</f>does what is right is acceptable to him.
10-36 As for <f>ⓞ</f>the word that he sent to Israel, <f>ⓟ</f>preaching good news of <f>ⓠ</f>peace through Jesus Christ (<f>ⓡ</f>he is Lord of all),
10-37 you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, <f>ⓢ</f>beginning <f>ⓣ</f>from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:
10-38 how <f>ⓤ</f>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth <f>ⓥ</f>with the Holy Spirit and with <f>ⓦ</f>power. He went about doing good and healing all <f>ⓧ</f>who were oppressed by the devil, <f>ⓨ</f>for God was with him.
10-39 And <f>ⓩ</f>we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. <f>ⓐ</f>They put him to death by hanging him on a tree,
10-40 but <f>ⓑ</f>God raised him on <f>ⓒ</f>the third day and made him to <f>ⓓ</f>appear,
10-41 <f>ⓔ</f> not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as <f>ⓕ</f>witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
10-42 And <f>ⓖ</f>he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify <f>ⓗ</f>that he is the one appointed by God to be judge <f>ⓘ</f>of the living and the dead.
10-43 <f>ⓙ</f> To him <f>ⓚ</f>all the prophets bear witness that <f>ⓛ</f>everyone who believes in him receives <f>ⓜ</f>forgiveness of sins <f>ⓝ</f>through his name.”
10-44 <pb/>While Peter was still saying these things, <f>ⓞ</f>the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.
10-45 And the believers from among <f>ⓟ</f>the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because <f>ⓠ</f>the gift of the Holy Spirit <f>ⓡ</f>was poured out even on the Gentiles.
10-46 For they were hearing them <f>ⓢ</f>speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,
10-47 <f>ⓣ</f> “Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit <f>ⓤ</f>just as we have?”
10-48 And he <f>ⓥ</f>commanded them <f>ⓦ</f>to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.
