25-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now Samuel died. And all Israel assembled <f>ⓑ</f>and mourned for him, and they buried him <f>ⓒ</f>in his house at <f>ⓓ</f>Ramah. <pb/><e>David and Abigail</e> </pb> <pb/>Then David rose and went down to <f>ⓔ</f>the wilderness of Paran.
25-2 And there was a man in <f>ⓕ</f>Maon whose business was in <f>ⓖ</f>Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. <f>ⓗ</f>He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
25-3 Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. The woman was discerning and beautiful, but the man was harsh and badly behaved; <f>ⓘ</f>he was a Calebite.
25-4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal <f>ⓙ</f>was shearing his sheep.
25-5 So David sent ten young men. And David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal and greet him in my name.
25-6 And thus you shall greet him: <f>ⓚ</f>‘Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
25-7 I hear that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, <f>ⓛ</f>and they missed nothing all the time they were in Carmel.
25-8 Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we come <f>ⓜ</f>on a feast day. Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.’”
25-9 <pb/>When David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David, and then they waited.
25-10 And Nabal answered David's servants, <f>ⓝ</f>“Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? <f>ⓞ</f>There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters.
25-11 Shall I take <f>ⓟ</f>my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to <f>ⓠ</f>men who come from I do not know where?”
25-12 So David's young men turned away and came back and told him all this.
25-13 And David said to his men, “Every man strap on his sword!” And every man of them strapped on his sword. David also strapped on his sword. And <f>ⓡ</f>about four hundred men went up after David, <f>ⓢ</f>while two hundred <f>ⓣ</f>remained with the baggage.
25-14 <pb/>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he railed at them.
25-15 Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, <f>ⓤ</f>and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them.
25-16 They were <f>ⓥ</f>a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
25-17 Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, <f>ⓦ</f>for harm is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such <f>ⓧ</f>a worthless man that one cannot speak to him.”
25-18 <pb/>Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs <f>[1]</f> of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
25-19 And she said to her young men, “Go on before me; behold, I come after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
25-20 And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.
25-21 Now David had said, “Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, <f>ⓨ</f>so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has <f>ⓩ</f>returned me evil for good.
25-22 <f>ⓐ</f> God do so to the enemies of David <f>[2]</f> and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.”
25-23 <pb/>When Abigail saw David, she hurried <f>ⓑ</f>and got down from the donkey <f>ⓒ</f>and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground.
25-24 She fell at his feet and said, <f>ⓓ</f>“On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant.
25-25 Let not my lord regard <f>ⓔ</f>this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal <f>[3]</f> is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.
25-26 Now then, my lord, <f>ⓕ</f>as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, because <f>ⓖ</f>the LORD has restrained you from bloodguilt and from <f>ⓗ</f>saving with your own hand, now then <f>ⓘ</f>let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal.
25-27 And now let this <f>ⓙ</f>present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.
25-28 Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the LORD will certainly make my lord <f>ⓚ</f>a sure house, because my lord <f>ⓛ</f>is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live.
25-29 If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the LORD your God. And the lives of your enemies <f>ⓜ</f>he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.
25-30 And when the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince <f>[4]</f> over Israel,
25-31 my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord <f>ⓝ</f>working salvation himself. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”
25-32 <pb/>And David said to Abigail, <f>ⓞ</f>“Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!
25-33 Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, <f>ⓟ</f>who have kept me this day from bloodguilt <f>ⓠ</f>and from working salvation with my own hand!
25-34 For as surely <f>ⓡ</f>as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, <f>ⓢ</f>who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male.”
25-35 Then David received from her hand what she had brought him. And he said to her, <f>ⓣ</f>“Go up in peace to your house. See, I have obeyed your voice, and I have granted your petition.”
25-36 <pb/>And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, <f>ⓤ</f>he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart <f>ⓥ</f>was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing <f>ⓦ</f>at all until the morning light.
25-37 In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
25-38 And about ten days later <f>ⓧ</f>the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.
25-39 <pb/>When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Blessed be the LORD who has <f>ⓩ</f>avenged the insult I received at the hand of Nabal, <f>ⓐ</f>and has kept back his servant from wrongdoing. <f>ⓑ</f>The LORD has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent and <f>ⓒ</f>spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife.
25-40 When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.”
25-41 And she rose <f>ⓓ</f>and bowed with her face to the ground and said, “Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.”
25-42 And Abigail hurried and rose and mounted a donkey, and her five young women attended her. She followed the messengers of David and became his wife.
25-43 <pb/>David also took Ahinoam of <f>ⓔ</f>Jezreel, <f>ⓕ</f>and both of them became his wives.
25-44 Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.

148-6 <t>And he <f>ⓘ</f>established them forever and ever; </t><t>he gave <f>ⓙ</f>a decree, and it shall not <f>ⓚ</f>pass away. <f>[1]</f> </t>
148-7 <pb/><t>Praise the LORD <f>ⓛ</f>from the earth, </t><t>you <f>ⓜ</f>great sea creatures and all deeps,</t>
148-8 <t><f>ⓝ</f> fire and hail, <f>ⓞ</f>snow and mist, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>stormy wind <f>ⓠ</f>fulfilling his word! </t>

18-1 <pb/>And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought <f>ⓐ</f>always to pray and not <f>ⓑ</f>lose heart.
18-2 He said, <J>“In a certain city there was a judge who <f>ⓒ</f>neither feared God nor respected man.</J>
18-3 <J>And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’</J>
18-4 <J>For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man,</J>
18-5 <J>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’”</J>
18-6 And the Lord said, <J>“Hear what the unrighteous judge says.</J>
18-7 <J>And <f>ⓔ</f>will not God give justice to <f>ⓕ</f>his elect, <f>ⓖ</f>who cry to him day and night? <f>ⓗ</f> <f>ⓘ</f>Will he delay long over them?</J>
18-8 <J>I tell you, he will give justice to them <f>ⓙ</f>speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, <f>ⓚ</f>will he find faith on earth?”</J>
18-9 <pb/>He also told this parable to some <f>ⓛ</f>who trusted <f>ⓜ</f>in themselves that they were righteous, <f>ⓝ</f>and treated others with contempt:
18-10 <J>“Two men <f>ⓞ</f>went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</J>
18-11 <J>The Pharisee, <f>ⓟ</f>standing by himself, prayed <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓠ</f>thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</J>
18-12 <J><f>ⓡ</f> I fast twice a week; <f>ⓢ</f>I give tithes of all that I get.’</J>
18-13 <J>But the tax collector, <f>ⓣ</f>standing far off, <f>ⓤ</f>would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but <f>ⓥ</f>beat his breast, saying, ‘God, <f>ⓦ</f>be merciful to me, a sinner!’</J>
18-14 <J>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For <f>ⓧ</f>everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</J>
18-15 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they <f>ⓩ</f>rebuked them.
18-16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“Let the children come to me, and <f>ⓑ</f>do not hinder them, <f>ⓒ</f>for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</J>
18-17 <J><f>ⓓ</f> Truly, I say to you, whoever does not <f>ⓔ</f>receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”</J>
18-18 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to <f>ⓖ</f>inherit eternal life?”
18-19 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</J>
18-20 <J>You know the commandments: <f>ⓗ</f>‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’”</J>
18-21 And he said, <f>ⓘ</f>“All these I have kept from my youth.”
18-22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, <J>“One thing you still lack. <f>ⓙ</f>Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have <f>ⓚ</f>treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</J>
18-23 <f>ⓛ</f> But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.
18-24 Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter <f>ⓝ</f>the kingdom of God!</J>
18-25 <J>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter <f>ⓞ</f>the kingdom of God.”</J>
18-26 Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”
18-27 But he said, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</J>
18-28 And Peter said, “See, <f>ⓠ</f>we have left our homes and followed you.”
18-29 And he said to them, <J>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓡ</f>there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers <f>[2]</f> or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</J>
18-30 <J>who will not receive <f>ⓢ</f>many times more <f>ⓣ</f>in this time, and in <f>ⓤ</f>the age to come eternal life.”</J>
18-31 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> And taking the twelve, he said to them, <J>“See, <f>ⓦ</f>we are going up to Jerusalem, and <f>ⓧ</f>everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.</J>
18-32 <J>For he will be <f>ⓨ</f>delivered over to the Gentiles and will be <f>ⓩ</f>mocked and shamefully treated and <f>ⓐ</f>spit upon.</J>
18-33 <J>And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on <f>ⓑ</f>the third day he will rise.”</J>
18-34 <f>ⓒ</f> But they understood none of these things. <f>ⓓ</f>This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.
18-35 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> As he drew near to Jericho, <f>ⓕ</f>a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
18-36 And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant.
18-37 They told him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”
18-38 And he cried out, “Jesus, <f>ⓗ</f>Son of David, have mercy on me!”
18-39 And those who were in front <f>ⓘ</f>rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
18-40 And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,
18-41 <J><f>ⓙ</f> “What do you want me to do for you?”</J> He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.”
18-42 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Recover your sight; <f>ⓚ</f>your faith has <f>ⓛ</f>made you well.”</J>
18-43 And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, <f>ⓜ</f>glorifying God. And <f>ⓝ</f>all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
