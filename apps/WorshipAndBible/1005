12-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight against the Ammonites and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire.”
12-2 And Jephthah said to them, “I and my people had a great dispute with the Ammonites, and when I called you, you did not save me from their hand.
12-3 And when I saw that you would not save me, <f>ⓑ</f>I took my life in my hand and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?”
12-4 Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, <f>ⓒ</f>“You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh.”
12-5 And the Gileadites captured <f>ⓓ</f>the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me go over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” When he said, “No,”
12-6 they said to him, “Then say Shibboleth,” and he said, “Sibboleth,” for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slaughtered him at <f>ⓔ</f>the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell.
12-7 <pb/>Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city in Gilead. <f>[1]</f>
12-8 <pb/>After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
12-9 He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he gave in marriage outside his clan, and thirty daughters he brought in from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
12-10 Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
12-11 <pb/>After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.
12-12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
12-13 <pb/>After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
12-14 He had forty <f>ⓕ</f>sons and thirty grandsons, who <f>ⓖ</f>rode on seventy donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years.
12-15 Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
110-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> The LORD says to my Lord: </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>“Sit at my right hand, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>until I make your enemies your <f>ⓓ</f>footstool.” </t>
110-2 <pb/><t>The LORD sends forth <f>ⓔ</f>from Zion </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>your mighty scepter. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>Rule in the midst of your enemies!</t>
110-3 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Your people will <f>ⓘ</f>offer themselves freely </t><t>on the day of your <f>ⓙ</f>power, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>in <f>ⓚ</f>holy garments; <f>[2]</f> </t><t>from the womb of the morning, </t><t>the dew of your youth will be yours. <f>[3]</f></t>
110-4 <t><f>ⓛ</f> The LORD has <f>ⓜ</f>sworn </t><t>and will <f>ⓝ</f>not change his mind, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>“You are <f>ⓟ</f>a priest <f>ⓠ</f>forever </t><t>after the order of <f>ⓡ</f>Melchizedek.” </t>
110-5 <pb/><t>The Lord is at your <f>ⓢ</f>right hand; </t><t>he will <f>ⓣ</f>shatter kings on <f>ⓤ</f>the day of his wrath.</t>
110-6 <t>He will <f>ⓥ</f>execute judgment among the nations, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>filling them with corpses; </t><t>he will <f>ⓧ</f>shatter chiefs <f>[4]</f> </t><t>over the wide earth.</t>
110-7 <t>He will <f>ⓨ</f>drink from the brook by the way; </t><t>therefore he will lift up his head. </t>
24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
24-2 But he answered them, <J>“You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓑ</f>there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”</J>
24-3 <pb/>As he sat on <f>ⓒ</f>the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him <f>ⓓ</f>privately, saying, “Tell us, <f>ⓔ</f>when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your <f>ⓕ</f>coming and of <f>ⓖ</f>the end of the age?”
24-4 And Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“See that no one leads you astray.</J>
24-5 <J>For <f>ⓘ</f>many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am <f>ⓙ</f>the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.</J>
24-6 <J>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you <f>ⓚ</f>are not alarmed, for this <f>ⓛ</f>must take place, but the end is not yet.</J>
24-7 <J>For <f>ⓜ</f>nation will rise against nation, and <f>ⓝ</f>kingdom against kingdom, and there will be <f>ⓞ</f>famines and earthquakes in various places.</J>
24-8 <J>All these are but the beginning of <f>ⓟ</f>the birth pains.</J>
24-9 <pb/><J>“Then <f>ⓠ</f>they will deliver you up <f>ⓡ</f>to tribulation and <f>ⓢ</f>put you to death, and <f>ⓣ</f>you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.</J>
24-10 <J>And then many will fall away <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓤ</f>betray one another and hate one another.</J>
24-11 <J>And many <f>ⓥ</f>false prophets will arise <f>ⓦ</f>and lead many astray.</J>
24-12 <J>And because lawlessness will be increased, <f>ⓧ</f>the love of many will grow cold.</J>
24-13 <J><f>ⓨ</f> But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</J>
24-14 <J>And this gospel of the kingdom <f>ⓩ</f>will be proclaimed throughout the whole world <f>ⓐ</f>as a testimony <f>ⓑ</f>to all nations, and <f>ⓒ</f>then the end will come.</J>
24-15 <pb/><J>“So when you see the abomination of desolation <f>ⓓ</f>spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in <f>ⓔ</f>the holy place (<f>ⓕ</f>let the reader understand),</J>
24-16 <J>then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</J>
24-17 <J><f>ⓖ</f> Let the one who is on <f>ⓗ</f>the housetop not go down to take what is in his house,</J>
24-18 <J>and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.</J>
24-19 <J>And <f>ⓘ</f>alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days!</J>
24-20 <J>Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.</J>
24-21 <J>For then there will be <f>ⓙ</f>great tribulation, <f>ⓚ</f>such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.</J>
24-22 <J>And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for <f>ⓛ</f>the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.</J>
24-23 <J><f>ⓜ</f> Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.</J>
24-24 <J>For <f>ⓝ</f>false christs and <f>ⓞ</f>false prophets will arise and <f>ⓟ</f>perform great signs and wonders, <f>ⓠ</f>so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</J>
24-25 <J>See, <f>ⓡ</f>I have told you beforehand.</J>
24-26 <J>So, if they say to you, ‘Look, <f>ⓢ</f>he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.</J>
24-27 <J><f>ⓣ</f> For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be <f>ⓤ</f>the coming of the Son of Man.</J>
24-28 <J><f>ⓥ</f> Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.</J>
24-29 <pb/><J>“Immediately after <f>ⓦ</f>the tribulation of those days <f>ⓧ</f>the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and <f>ⓨ</f>the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</J>
24-30 <J>Then <f>ⓩ</f>will appear in heaven <f>ⓐ</f>the sign of the Son of Man, and then <f>ⓑ</f>all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and <f>ⓒ</f>they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven <f>ⓓ</f>with power and great glory.</J>
24-31 <J>And <f>ⓔ</f>he will send out his angels with a loud <f>ⓕ</f>trumpet call, and they will <f>ⓖ</f>gather <f>ⓗ</f>his elect from <f>ⓘ</f>the four winds, <f>ⓙ</f>from one end of heaven to the other.</J>
24-32 <pb/><J>“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.</J>
24-33 <J>So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, <f>ⓚ</f>at the very gates.</J>

24-35 <J><f>ⓜ</f> Heaven and earth will pass away, but <f>ⓝ</f>my words will not pass away.</J>

24-37 <J><f>ⓡ</f> For as were the days of Noah, <f>ⓢ</f>so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</J>
24-38 <J><f>ⓣ</f> For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, <f>ⓤ</f>marrying and giving in marriage, until <f>ⓥ</f>the day when Noah entered the ark,</J>
24-39 <J>and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, <f>ⓦ</f>so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</J>
24-40 <J>Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.</J>
24-41 <J><f>ⓧ</f> Two women will be grinding <f>ⓨ</f>at the mill; one will be taken and one left.</J>
24-42 <J>Therefore, <f>ⓩ</f>stay awake, for you do not know on what day <f>ⓐ</f>your Lord is coming.</J>
24-43 <J><f>ⓑ</f> But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night <f>ⓒ</f>the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.</J>
24-44 <J>Therefore you also must be <f>ⓓ</f>ready, for <f>ⓔ</f>the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.</J>
24-45 <pb/><J>“Who then is <f>ⓕ</f>the faithful and <f>ⓖ</f>wise servant, <f>[3]</f> whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?</J>
24-46 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.</J>
24-47 <J>Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓘ</f>he will set him over all his possessions.</J>
24-48 <J>But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master <f>ⓙ</f>is delayed,’</J>
24-49 <J>and begins to beat his fellow servants <f>[4]</f> and eats and drinks with <f>ⓚ</f>drunkards,</J>
24-50 <J>the master of that servant will come <f>ⓛ</f>on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know</J>
24-51 <J>and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place <f>ⓜ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</J>
