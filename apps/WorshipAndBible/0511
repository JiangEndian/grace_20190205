Job 5-1 <pb/><t>“Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? </t><t>To which of <f>ⓐ</f>the holy ones will you turn?</t>
Job 5-2 <t>Surely vexation kills the fool, </t><t>and jealousy slays the simple.</t>
Job 5-3 <t><f>ⓑ</f> I have seen the fool taking root, </t><t>but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.</t>
Job 5-4 <t>His children are <f>ⓒ</f>far from safety; </t><t>they are crushed in <f>ⓓ</f>the gate, </t><t>and there is no one to deliver them.</t>
Job 5-5 <t>The hungry eat his harvest, </t><t>and he takes it even out of thorns, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and the thirsty pant <f>[2]</f> after his <f>[3]</f> wealth.</t>
Job 5-6 <t>For affliction does not come from the dust, </t><t>nor does trouble sprout from the ground,</t>
Job 5-7 <t>but man is <f>ⓔ</f>born to trouble </t><t>as the sparks fly upward. </t>
Job 5-8 <pb/><t>“As for me, I would seek God, </t><t>and to God would I commit my cause,</t>
Job 5-9 <t>who <f>ⓕ</f>does great things and <f>ⓖ</f>unsearchable, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>marvelous things without number:</t>
Job 5-10 <t>he gives <f>ⓘ</f>rain on the earth </t><t>and sends waters on the fields;</t>
Job 5-11 <t>he <f>ⓙ</f>sets on high those who are lowly, </t><t>and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</t>
Job 5-12 <t>He <f>ⓚ</f>frustrates the devices of the crafty, </t><t>so that their hands achieve no success.</t>
Job 5-13 <t>He <f>ⓛ</f>catches the wise in their own craftiness, </t><t>and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.</t>
Job 5-14 <t>They meet with darkness in the daytime </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>grope at noonday as in the night.</t>

Ezekiel 4-1 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>take a brick and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem.
Ezekiel 4-2 <f>ⓒ</f> And put siegeworks against it, <f>ⓓ</f>and build a siege wall against it, <f>ⓔ</f>and cast up a mound against it. Set camps also against it, <f>ⓕ</f>and plant battering rams against it all around.
Ezekiel 4-3 And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; <f>ⓖ</f>and set your face toward it, <f>ⓗ</f>and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is <f>ⓘ</f>a sign for the house of Israel.
Ezekiel 4-4 <pb/>“Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment <f>[1]</f> of the house of Israel upon it. For the number of the days that you lie on it, <f>ⓙ</f>you shall bear their punishment.
Ezekiel 4-5 For I assign to you a number of days, <f>ⓚ</f>390 days, <f>ⓛ</f>equal to the number of the years of their punishment. <f>ⓜ</f>So long shall you bear <f>ⓝ</f>the punishment of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel 4-6 And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and <f>ⓞ</f>bear <f>ⓟ</f>the punishment of the house of Judah. <f>ⓠ</f>Forty days I assign you, a day for each year.
Ezekiel 4-7 <f>ⓡ</f> And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, <f>ⓢ</f>with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against the city.
Ezekiel 4-8 And behold, <f>ⓣ</f>I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed <f>ⓤ</f>the days of your siege.
Ezekiel 4-9 <pb/>“And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and emmer, <f>[2]</f> and put them into a single vessel and make your <f>ⓥ</f>bread from them. <f>ⓦ</f>During the number of days that you lie on your side, <f>ⓧ</f>390 days, you shall eat it.
Ezekiel 4-10 And your food that you eat shall be <f>ⓨ</f>by weight, <f>ⓩ</f>twenty shekels <f>[3]</f> a day; from day to day <f>[4]</f> you shall eat it.
Ezekiel 4-11 And water you shall drink <f>ⓐ</f>by measure, the sixth part of a hin; <f>[5]</f> from day to day you shall drink.
Ezekiel 4-12 And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it <f>ⓑ</f>in their sight on human dung.”
Ezekiel 4-13 And the LORD said, “Thus shall the people of Israel eat <f>ⓒ</f>their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.”
Ezekiel 4-14 Then I said, <f>ⓓ</f>“Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never defiled myself. <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>From my youth up till now I have never eaten <f>ⓕ</f>what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has <f>ⓖ</f>tainted meat come into my mouth.”
Ezekiel 4-15 Then he said to me, “See, I assign to you cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread.”
Ezekiel 4-16 Moreover, he said to me, <f>ⓗ</f>“Son of man, behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I will break the supply <f>[7]</f> of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread <f>ⓙ</f>by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water <f>ⓚ</f>by measure and in dismay.
Ezekiel 4-17 I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and <f>ⓛ</f>look at one another in dismay, and <f>ⓜ</f>rot away because of their punishment.
Revelation 5-1 <pb/>Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne <f>ⓐ</f>a scroll written within and on the back, <f>ⓑ</f>sealed with seven seals.
Revelation 5-2 And <f>ⓒ</f>I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”
Revelation 5-3 And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it,
Revelation 5-4 and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
Revelation 5-5 And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, <f>ⓓ</f>the Lion <f>ⓔ</f>of the tribe of Judah, <f>ⓕ</f>the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”
Revelation 5-6 <pb/>And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw <f>ⓖ</f>a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with <f>ⓗ</f>seven eyes, which are <f>ⓘ</f>the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
Revelation 5-7 And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
Revelation 5-8 And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders <f>ⓙ</f>fell down before the Lamb, <f>ⓚ</f>each holding a harp, and <f>ⓛ</f>golden bowls full of incense, <f>ⓜ</f>which are the prayers of the saints.
Revelation 5-9 And they sang <f>ⓝ</f>a new song, saying, <pb/><t>“Worthy are you to take the scroll </t><t>and to open its seals, </t><t>for <f>ⓞ</f>you were slain, and by your blood <f>ⓟ</f>you ransomed people for God </t><t>from <f>ⓠ</f>every tribe and language and people and nation,</t>
Revelation 5-10 <t>and you have made them <f>ⓡ</f>a kingdom and priests to our God, </t><t>and they shall reign on the earth.” </t>
Revelation 5-11 <pb/>Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering <f>ⓢ</f>myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
Revelation 5-12 saying with a loud voice, <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, </t><t>to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might </t><t>and honor and glory and blessing!” </t>
Revelation 5-13 <pb/>And I heard <f>ⓤ</f>every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, <pb/><t>“To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb </t><t>be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!” </t>
Revelation 5-14 <pb/>And the four living creatures <f>ⓥ</f>said, “Amen!” and the elders <f>ⓦ</f>fell down and worshiped.
