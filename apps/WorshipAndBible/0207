1 Chronicles 10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
1 Chronicles 10-2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
1 Chronicles 10-3 The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.
1 Chronicles 10-4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mistreat me.” But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
1 Chronicles 10-5 And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.
1 Chronicles 10-6 Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.
1 Chronicles 10-7 And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army <f>[1]</f> had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.
1 Chronicles 10-8 <pb/>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
1 Chronicles 10-9 And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
1 Chronicles 10-10 And they put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
1 Chronicles 10-11 But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
1 Chronicles 10-12 all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
1 Chronicles 10-13 <pb/>So Saul died <f>ⓑ</f>for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the LORD in that he did not keep the command of the LORD, and also <f>ⓒ</f>consulted a medium, seeking guidance.
1 Chronicles 10-14 He <f>ⓓ</f>did not seek guidance from the LORD. Therefore the LORD put him to death and <f>ⓔ</f>turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.
Isaiah 34-1 <pb/><t>Draw near, <f>ⓐ</f>O nations, to hear, </t><t>and give attention, O peoples! </t><t>Let the earth hear, and all that fills it; </t><t>the world, and all that comes from it.</t>
Isaiah 34-2 <t>For the LORD is enraged against all the nations, </t><t>and furious against all their host; </t><t>he has <f>ⓑ</f>devoted them to destruction, <f>[1]</f> has given them over for slaughter.</t>

Isaiah 34-5 <pb/><t>For my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; </t><t>behold, it descends for judgment upon <f>ⓕ</f>Edom, </t><t>upon the people <f>ⓖ</f>I have devoted to destruction.</t>
Isaiah 34-6 <t>The LORD has a sword; it is sated with blood; </t><t>it is gorged with fat, </t><t>with the blood of lambs and goats, </t><t>with the fat of the kidneys of rams. </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah, </t><t>a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</t>
Isaiah 34-7 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Wild oxen shall <f>ⓙ</f>fall with them, </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>young steers with <f>ⓛ</f>the mighty bulls. </t><t>Their land shall drink its fill of blood, </t><t>and their soil shall be gorged with fat. </t>
Isaiah 34-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> For the LORD has a day of vengeance, </t><t>a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.</t>
Isaiah 34-9 <t><f>ⓝ</f> And the streams of Edom <f>[2]</f> shall be turned into pitch, </t><t>and her soil into sulfur; </t><t>her land shall become burning pitch.</t>
Isaiah 34-10 <t>Night and day <f>ⓞ</f>it shall not be quenched; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>its smoke shall go up forever. </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>From generation to generation it shall lie waste; </t><t>none shall pass through it forever and ever.</t>
Isaiah 34-11 <t><f>ⓡ</f> But the hawk and the porcupine <f>[3]</f> shall possess it, </t><t>the owl and the raven shall dwell in it. </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>He shall stretch the line of <f>ⓣ</f>confusion <f>[4]</f> over it, </t><t>and the plumb line of emptiness.</t>
Isaiah 34-12 <t>Its nobles — there is no one there to call it a kingdom, </t><t>and all its princes shall be nothing. </t>
Isaiah 34-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f> Thorns shall grow over its strongholds, </t><t>nettles and thistles in its fortresses. </t><t>It shall be the haunt of <f>ⓥ</f>jackals, </t><t>an abode for ostriches. <f>[5]</f></t>
Isaiah 34-14 <t><f>ⓦ</f> And wild animals shall meet with hyenas; </t><t>the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; </t><t>indeed, there the night bird <f>[6]</f> settles </t><t>and finds for herself a resting place. </t>
Isaiah 34-15 <pb/><t>There the owl nests and lays </t><t>and hatches and gathers her young in her shadow; </t><t>indeed, there <f>ⓧ</f>the hawks are gathered, </t><t>each one with her mate.</t>
Isaiah 34-16 <t>Seek and read from the book of the LORD: </t><t>Not one of these shall be missing; </t><t>none shall be without her mate. </t><t>For the mouth of the LORD has commanded, </t><t>and his Spirit has gathered them.</t>
Isaiah 34-17 <t><f>ⓨ</f> He has cast the lot for them; </t><t>his hand has portioned it out to them with the line; </t><t>they shall possess it forever; </t><t>from generation to generation they shall dwell in it. </t>
1 Corinthians 16-1 <pb/>Now concerning <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do.
1 Corinthians 16-2 On <f>ⓑ</f>the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, <f>ⓒ</f>as he may prosper, <f>ⓓ</f>so that there will be no collecting when I come.
1 Corinthians 16-3 And when I arrive, I will send <f>ⓔ</f>those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
1 Corinthians 16-4 If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
1 Corinthians 16-5 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> I will visit you after passing through <f>ⓖ</f>Macedonia, for <f>ⓗ</f>I intend to pass through Macedonia,
1 Corinthians 16-6 and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may <f>ⓘ</f>help me on my journey, wherever I go.
1 Corinthians 16-7 For I do not want to see you now <f>ⓙ</f>just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, <f>ⓚ</f>if the Lord permits.
1 Corinthians 16-8 But I will stay in Ephesus until <f>ⓛ</f>Pentecost,
1 Corinthians 16-9 for <f>ⓜ</f>a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and <f>ⓝ</f>there are many adversaries.
1 Corinthians 16-10 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for <f>ⓟ</f>he is doing <f>ⓠ</f>the work of the Lord, as I am.
1 Corinthians 16-11 So <f>ⓡ</f>let no one despise him. <f>ⓢ</f>Help him on his way <f>ⓣ</f>in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.
1 Corinthians 16-12 <pb/>Now concerning <f>ⓤ</f>our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will <f>[2]</f> to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.
1 Corinthians 16-13 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Be watchful, <f>ⓦ</f>stand firm in the faith, <f>ⓧ</f>act like men, <f>ⓨ</f>be strong.
1 Corinthians 16-14 <f>ⓩ</f> Let all that you do be done in love.
1 Corinthians 16-15 <pb/>Now I urge you, brothers <f>[3]</f> — you know that <f>ⓐ</f>the household <f>[4]</f> of Stephanas were <f>ⓑ</f>the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves <f>ⓒ</f>to the service of the saints —
1 Corinthians 16-16 <f>ⓓ</f> be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.
1 Corinthians 16-17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for <f>ⓔ</f>your absence,
1 Corinthians 16-18 for they <f>ⓕ</f>refreshed my spirit as well as yours. <f>ⓖ</f>Give recognition to such people.
1 Corinthians 16-19 <pb/>The churches of Asia send you greetings. <f>ⓗ</f>Aquila and Prisca, together with <f>ⓘ</f>the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 16-20 All the brothers send you greetings. <f>ⓙ</f>Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians 16-21 <pb/>I, Paul, write <f>ⓚ</f>this greeting with my own hand.
1 Corinthians 16-22 If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be <f>ⓛ</f>accursed. Our Lord, come! <f>[5]</f>
1 Corinthians 16-23 <f>ⓜ</f> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1 Corinthians 16-24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
