Genesis 45-1 <pb/>Then Joseph could not <f>ⓐ</f>control himself before all those who stood by him. He cried, “Make everyone go out from me.” So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
Genesis 45-2 And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.
Genesis 45-3 And Joseph said to his brothers, <f>ⓑ</f>“I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
Genesis 45-4 <pb/>So Joseph said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” And they came near. And he said, “I am your brother, Joseph, <f>ⓒ</f>whom you sold into Egypt.
Genesis 45-5 And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, <f>ⓓ</f>for God sent me before you to preserve life.
Genesis 45-6 For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are <f>ⓔ</f>yet five years in which there will be neither <f>ⓕ</f>plowing nor harvest.
Genesis 45-7 And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.
Genesis 45-8 So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and <f>ⓖ</f>ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 45-9 Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not tarry.
Genesis 45-10 <f>ⓗ</f> You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.
Genesis 45-11 <f>ⓘ</f> There I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come, so that you and your household, and all that you have, do not come to poverty.’
Genesis 45-12 And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is <f>ⓙ</f>my mouth that speaks to you.
Genesis 45-13 You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Hurry and <f>ⓚ</f>bring my father down here.”
Genesis 45-14 Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Genesis 45-15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. After that his brothers talked with him.
Genesis 45-16 <pb/>When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, “Joseph's brothers have come,” it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.
Genesis 45-17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan,
Genesis 45-18 and take your father and your households, and come to me, and <f>ⓛ</f>I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.’
Genesis 45-19 And you, Joseph, are commanded to say, ‘Do this: take <f>ⓜ</f>wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Genesis 45-20 Have no concern for <f>[1]</f> your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”
Genesis 45-21 <pb/>The sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them <f>ⓝ</f>wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
Genesis 45-22 To each and all of them he gave <f>ⓞ</f>a change of clothes, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels <f>[2]</f> of silver and <f>ⓟ</f>five changes of clothes.
Genesis 45-23 To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey.
Genesis 45-24 Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, <f>ⓠ</f>“Do not quarrel on the way.”
Genesis 45-25 <pb/>So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.
Genesis 45-26 And they told him, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them.
Genesis 45-27 But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw <f>ⓡ</f>the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
Genesis 45-28 And Israel said, “It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
Ezra 7-1 <pb/>Now after this, <f>ⓐ</f>in the reign of <f>ⓑ</f>Artaxerxes king of Persia, <f>ⓒ</f>Ezra the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
Ezra 7-2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,
Ezra 7-3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,
Ezra 7-4 son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,
Ezra 7-5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest —
Ezra 7-6 this Ezra went up from Babylonia. He was a scribe <f>ⓓ</f>skilled in the Law of Moses that the LORD, the God of Israel, had given, and the king granted him all that he asked, <f>ⓔ</f>for the hand of the LORD his God was on him.
Ezra 7-7 <pb/>And there went up also to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king, some of the people of Israel, and <f>ⓕ</f>some of the priests and <f>ⓖ</f>Levites, the singers and gatekeepers, and the temple <f>ⓗ</f>servants.
Ezra 7-8 And Ezra <f>[1]</f> came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
Ezra 7-9 For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylonia, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, <f>ⓘ</f>for the good hand of his God was on him.
Ezra 7-10 For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, and to do it <f>ⓙ</f>and to <f>ⓚ</f>teach his statutes and rules in Israel.
Ezra 7-11 <pb/>This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a man learned in matters of the commandments of the LORD and his statutes for Israel:
Ezra 7-12 “Artaxerxes, <f>ⓛ</f>king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the <f>ⓜ</f>scribe of the Law of the God of heaven. Peace. <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>And now
Ezra 7-13 <f>ⓞ</f> I make a decree that anyone of the people of Israel or their priests or Levites in my kingdom, who freely offers to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.
Ezra 7-14 For you are sent by the king <f>ⓟ</f>and his seven counselors to make inquiries about Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God, which is in your hand,
Ezra 7-15 and also to carry the silver and gold that the king <f>ⓠ</f>and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, <f>ⓡ</f>whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
Ezra 7-16 <f>ⓢ</f> with all the silver and gold that you shall find in the whole province of Babylonia, and <f>ⓣ</f>with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests, vowed willingly for the house of their God that is in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7-17 With this money, then, you shall with all diligence buy bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and <f>ⓤ</f>you shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God that is in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7-18 Whatever seems good to you and your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do, according to the will of your God.
Ezra 7-19 The vessels that have been given you for the service of the house of your God, you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem.
Ezra 7-20 And whatever else is required for the house of your God, which it falls to you to provide, you may provide it out of the king's treasury.
Ezra 7-21 <pb/>“And I, Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers in the province Beyond the River: Whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, requires of you, let it be done with all diligence,
Ezra 7-22 up to 100 talents <f>[3]</f> of silver, 100 cors <f>[4]</f> of wheat, 100 baths <f>[5]</f> of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
Ezra 7-23 Whatever is decreed by the God of heaven, let it be done in full for the house of the God of heaven, lest his wrath be against the realm of the king and his sons.
Ezra 7-24 We also notify you that it shall not be lawful to impose <f>ⓥ</f>tribute, custom, or toll on anyone of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.
Ezra 7-25 <pb/>“And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, <f>ⓦ</f>appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people in the province Beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God. <f>ⓧ</f>And those who do not know them, you shall teach.
Ezra 7-26 Whoever will not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be strictly executed on him, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of his goods or for imprisonment.”
Ezra 7-27 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, <f>ⓩ</f>who put such a thing as this into the heart of the king, to beautify the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem,
Ezra 7-28 <f>ⓐ</f> and who extended to me his steadfast love before the king and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty officers. I took courage, for the hand of the LORD my God was on me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.
Jeremiah 30-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 30-2 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: <f>ⓐ</f>Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.
Jeremiah 30-3 <f>ⓑ</f> For behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>when I will restore <f>ⓓ</f>the fortunes of my people, <f>ⓔ</f>Israel and Judah, says the LORD, <f>ⓕ</f>and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession of it.”
Jeremiah 30-4 <pb/>These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning <f>ⓖ</f>Israel and Judah:
Jeremiah 30-5 <pb/><t>“Thus says the LORD: </t><t>We have heard a cry of panic, </t><t>of terror, and no peace.</t>
Jeremiah 30-6 <t>Ask now, and see, </t><t>can a man bear a child? </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>Why then do I see every man </t><t>with his hands on his stomach <f>ⓘ</f>like a woman in labor? </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>Why has every face turned pale?</t>
Jeremiah 30-7 <t>Alas! <f>ⓚ</f>That day is so great </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>there is none like it; </t><t>it is a time of distress for Jacob; </t><t>yet he shall be saved out of it. </t>
Jeremiah 30-8 <pb/>“And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the LORD of hosts, that I will <f>ⓜ</f>break his <f>ⓝ</f>yoke from off your neck, and I will <f>ⓞ</f>burst your bonds, <f>ⓟ</f>and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him. <f>[1]</f>
Jeremiah 30-9 But they shall serve the LORD their God and <f>ⓠ</f>David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
Jeremiah 30-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f> “Then fear not, <f>ⓢ</f>O Jacob my servant, declares the LORD, </t><t>nor be dismayed, O Israel; </t><t>for behold, <f>ⓣ</f>I will save you from far away, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>and your offspring from the land of their captivity. </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, </t><t>and none shall make him afraid.</t>
Jeremiah 30-11 <t><f>ⓦ</f> For I am with you to save you, <pb/>declares the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>I will make a full end of all the nations </t><t>among whom I scattered you, </t><t>but of you I will not make a full end. </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>I will <f>ⓩ</f>discipline you in just measure, </t><t>and I will by no means leave you unpunished. </t>
Jeremiah 30-12 <pb/><t>“For thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>Your hurt is incurable, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>and your wound is grievous.</t>
Jeremiah 30-13 <t>There is none to uphold your cause, </t><t>no medicine for your wound, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>no healing for you.</t>
Jeremiah 30-14 <t><f>ⓓ</f> All your lovers have forgotten you; </t><t>they care nothing for you; </t><t>for I have dealt you the blow of <f>ⓔ</f>an enemy, </t><t>the punishment <f>ⓕ</f>of a merciless foe, </t><t>because your guilt is great, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>because your sins are flagrant.</t>
Jeremiah 30-15 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Why do you cry out over your hurt? </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>Your pain is incurable. </t><t>Because your guilt is great, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>because your sins are flagrant, </t><t>I have done these things to you.</t>
Jeremiah 30-16 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>those who plunder you shall be plundered, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>and all who prey on you I will make a prey.</t>
Jeremiah 30-17 <t><f>ⓞ</f> For I will restore <f>ⓟ</f>health to you, </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>your wounds I will heal, <pb/>declares the LORD, </t><t>because <f>ⓡ</f>they have called you an outcast: </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>‘It is Zion, for whom no one cares!’ </t>
Jeremiah 30-18 <pb/><t>“Thus says the LORD: </t><t>Behold, <f>ⓣ</f>I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob </t><t>and have compassion on his dwellings; </t><t>the city shall be rebuilt on <f>ⓤ</f>its mound, </t><t>and the palace shall stand where it used to be.</t>
Jeremiah 30-19 <t><f>ⓥ</f> Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving, </t><t>and the voices of those who celebrate. </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; </t><t>I will make them honored, and they shall not be small.</t>

Jeremiah 30-21 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Their prince shall be one of themselves; </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>their ruler shall come out from their midst; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>for who would dare of himself to approach me? <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 30-22 <t><f>ⓒ</f> And you shall be my people, </t><t>and I will be your God.” </t>
Jeremiah 30-23 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> Behold <f>ⓔ</f>the storm of the LORD! </t><t>Wrath has gone forth, </t><t>a whirling tempest; </t><t>it will burst upon the head of the wicked.</t>
Jeremiah 30-24 <t><f>ⓕ</f> The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back </t><t>until he has executed and accomplished </t><t>the intentions of his mind. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>In the latter days you will understand this. </t>
Hebrews 8-1 <pb/>Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, <f>ⓐ</f>one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
Hebrews 8-2 a minister in the holy places, in <f>ⓑ</f>the true tent <f>[1]</f> that the Lord <f>ⓒ</f>set up, not man.
Hebrews 8-3 For <f>ⓓ</f>every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus <f>ⓔ</f>it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
Hebrews 8-4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.
Hebrews 8-5 They serve <f>ⓕ</f>a copy and <f>ⓖ</f>shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, <f>ⓗ</f>“See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”
Hebrews 8-6 But as it is, Christ <f>[2]</f> has obtained a ministry that is <f>ⓘ</f>as much more excellent than the old as <f>ⓙ</f>the covenant <f>ⓚ</f>he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.
Hebrews 8-7 <f>ⓛ</f> For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.
Hebrews 8-8 <pb/>For he finds fault with them when he says: <f>[3]</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, </t><t>when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel </t><t>and with the house of Judah,</t>
Hebrews 8-9 <t>not like the covenant that I made with their fathers </t><t>on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. </t><t>For they did not continue in my covenant, </t><t>and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.</t>
Hebrews 8-10 <t><f>ⓝ</f> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel </t><t>after those days, declares the Lord: </t><t>I will put my laws into their minds, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>write them on their hearts, </t><t>and I will be their God, </t><t>and they shall be my people.</t>
Hebrews 8-11 <t>And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor </t><t>and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ </t><t>for they shall <f>ⓟ</f>all know me, </t><t>from the least of them to the greatest.</t>
Hebrews 8-12 <t>For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and I will remember their sins no more.” </t>
Hebrews 8-13 <pb/>In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And <f>ⓡ</f>what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
