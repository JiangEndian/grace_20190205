2-1 <pb/>Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to <f>ⓐ</f>Bochim. And he said, “I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, <f>ⓑ</f>‘I will never break my covenant with you,
2-2 <f>ⓒ</f> and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; <f>ⓓ</f>you shall break down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done?
2-3 So now I say, <f>ⓔ</f>I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become <f>ⓕ</f>thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.”
2-4 As soon as the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
2-5 And they called the name of that place Bochim. <f>[1]</f> And they sacrificed there to the LORD.
2-6 <pb/>When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land.
2-7 <f>ⓖ</f> And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the LORD had done for Israel.
2-8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110 years.
2-9 And they buried him within the boundaries of <f>ⓗ</f>his inheritance in Timnath-heres, <f>ⓘ</f>in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.
2-10 And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel.
2-11 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals.
2-12 <f>ⓚ</f> And they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. <f>ⓛ</f>They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and <f>ⓜ</f>bowed down to them. <f>ⓝ</f>And they provoked the LORD to anger.
2-13 They abandoned the LORD <f>ⓞ</f>and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth.
2-14 <f>ⓟ</f> So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he <f>ⓠ</f>gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. <f>ⓡ</f>And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, <f>ⓢ</f>so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.
2-15 Whenever they marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them for harm, as the LORD had warned, <f>ⓣ</f>and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.
2-16 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Then the LORD raised up judges, <f>ⓥ</f>who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them.
2-17 Yet they did not listen to their judges, for <f>ⓦ</f>they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. <f>ⓧ</f>They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the LORD, and they did not do so.
2-18 Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, <f>ⓨ</f>the LORD was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. <f>ⓩ</f>For the LORD was moved to pity by <f>ⓐ</f>their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them.
2-19 But <f>ⓑ</f>whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.
2-20 <f>ⓒ</f> So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he said, “Because this people <f>ⓓ</f>have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice,
2-21 <f>ⓔ</f> I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,
2-22 in order <f>ⓕ</f>to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the LORD as their fathers did, or not.”
2-23 So the LORD left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.
100-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f> Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth!</t>
100-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Serve the LORD with gladness! </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>Come into his presence with singing! </t>
100-3 <pb/><t>Know that <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD, he is God! </t><t>It is he who <f>ⓕ</f>made us, and <f>ⓖ</f>we are his; <f>[1]</f> </t><t>we are his <f>ⓗ</f>people, and <f>ⓘ</f>the sheep of his pasture. </t>
100-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Enter his gates with thanksgiving, </t><t>and his <f>ⓚ</f>courts with praise! </t><t>Give thanks to him; <f>ⓛ</f>bless his name! </t>
100-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> For the LORD is good; </t><t>his steadfast love endures forever, </t><t>and his <f>ⓝ</f>faithfulness to all generations. </t>
14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> At that time <f>ⓑ</f>Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus,
14-2 and he said to his servants, <f>ⓒ</f>“This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.”
14-3 For <f>ⓓ</f>Herod had seized John and bound him and <f>ⓔ</f>put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, <f>[1]</f>
14-4 because John had been saying to him, <f>ⓕ</f>“It is not lawful for you to have her.”
14-5 And though he wanted to put him to death, <f>ⓖ</f>he feared the people, because they held him to be <f>ⓗ</f>a prophet.
14-6 But when Herod's <f>ⓘ</f>birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod,
14-7 so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
14-8 Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”
14-9 And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given.
14-10 He sent and had John beheaded in the prison,
14-11 and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
14-12 And <f>ⓙ</f>his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.
14-13 <pb/>Now when Jesus heard this, <f>ⓚ</f>he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
14-14 When he went ashore he <f>ⓛ</f>saw a great crowd, and <f>ⓜ</f>he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
14-15 Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; <f>ⓝ</f>send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”
14-16 But Jesus said, <J>“They need not go away; <f>ⓞ</f>you give them something to eat.”</J>
14-17 They said to him, “We have only five loaves here and two fish.”
14-18 And he said, <J>“Bring them here to me.”</J>
14-19 Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, <f>ⓟ</f>he looked up to heaven and <f>ⓠ</f>said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
14-20 And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
14-21 And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
14-22 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Immediately he <f>ⓢ</f>made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
14-23 And after he had dismissed the crowds, <f>ⓣ</f>he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When <f>ⓤ</f>evening came, he was there alone,
14-24 but the boat by this time was a long way <f>[2]</f> from the land, <f>[3]</f> beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.
14-25 And <f>ⓥ</f>in the fourth watch of the night <f>[4]</f> he came to them, walking on the sea.
14-26 But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, <f>ⓦ</f>they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear.
14-27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <J> <f>ⓧ</f>“Take heart; it is I. <f>ⓨ</f>Do not be afraid.”</J>
14-28 <pb/>And Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”
14-29 He said, <J>“Come.”</J> So Peter got out of the boat and <f>ⓩ</f>walked on the water and came to Jesus.
14-30 But when he saw the wind, <f>[5]</f> he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, <f>ⓐ</f>“Lord, save me.”
14-31 Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“O you of little faith, why did you <f>ⓒ</f>doubt?”</J>
14-32 And when they got into the boat, <f>ⓓ</f>the wind ceased.
14-33 And <f>ⓔ</f>those in the boat <f>ⓕ</f>worshiped him, saying, <f>ⓖ</f>“Truly you are <f>ⓗ</f>the Son of God.”
14-34 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> And when they had crossed over, they came to land at <f>ⓙ</f>Gennesaret.
14-35 And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and <f>ⓚ</f>brought to him all who were sick
14-36 and implored him that they might only touch <f>ⓛ</f>the fringe of his garment. And <f>ⓜ</f>as many as touched it were made well.
