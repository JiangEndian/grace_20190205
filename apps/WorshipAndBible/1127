9-1 <pb/>And David said, “Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may <f>ⓐ</f>show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?”
9-2 Now there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was <f>ⓑ</f>Ziba, and they called him to David. And the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” And he said, “I am your servant.”
9-3 And the king said, “Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, that I may show <f>ⓒ</f>the kindness of God to him?” Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of <f>ⓓ</f>Jonathan; he is crippled in his feet.”
9-4 The king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba said to the king, “He is in the house of <f>ⓔ</f>Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.”
9-5 Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar.
9-6 And <f>ⓕ</f>Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, “Mephibosheth!” And he answered, “Behold, I am your servant.”
9-7 And David said to him, “Do not fear, <f>ⓖ</f>for I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your father, and <f>ⓗ</f>you shall eat at my table always.”
9-8 And he paid homage and said, “What is your servant, that you should show regard for <f>ⓘ</f>a dead dog such as I?”
9-9 <pb/>Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master's grandson.
9-10 And you and your sons and your servants shall till the land for him and shall bring in the produce, that your master's grandson may have bread to eat. But Mephibosheth your master's grandson <f>ⓙ</f>shall always eat at my table.” Now Ziba had <f>ⓚ</f>fifteen sons and twenty servants.
9-11 Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so will your servant do.” So Mephibosheth <f>ⓛ</f>ate at David's <f>[1]</f> table, like one of the king's sons.
9-12 And Mephibosheth had a young son, <f>ⓜ</f>whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba's house became Mephibosheth's servants.
9-13 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for <f>ⓝ</f>he ate always at the king's table. Now <f>ⓞ</f>he was lame in both his feet.
13-1 <pb/><t><pb/>A wise son hears his father's instruction, </t><t>but <f>ⓐ</f>a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.</t>
13-2 <t>From the fruit of his mouth a man <f>ⓑ</f>eats what is good, </t><t>but the desire of the treacherous <f>ⓒ</f>is for violence.</t>
13-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>he who opens wide his lips <f>ⓕ</f>comes to ruin.</t>
13-4 <t><f>ⓖ</f> The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, </t><t>while the soul of the diligent <f>ⓗ</f>is richly supplied.</t>
13-5 <t>The righteous hates falsehood, </t><t>but the wicked brings shame <f>[1]</f> and disgrace.</t>
13-6 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Righteousness guards him whose <f>ⓙ</f>way is blameless, </t><t>but sin overthrows the wicked.</t>
13-7 <t><f>ⓚ</f> One pretends to be rich, <f>[2]</f> yet has nothing; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>another pretends to be poor, <f>[3]</f> yet has great wealth.</t>
13-8 <t>The ransom of a man's life is his wealth, </t><t>but a poor man <f>ⓜ</f>hears no threat.</t>
13-9 <t><f>ⓝ</f> The light of the righteous rejoices, </t><t>but <f>ⓞ</f>the lamp of the wicked will be put out.</t>
13-10 <t><f>ⓟ</f> By insolence comes nothing but strife, </t><t>but with those who take advice is wisdom.</t>
13-11 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Wealth gained hastily <f>[4]</f> will dwindle, </t><t>but whoever gathers little by little will increase it.</t>
13-12 <t>Hope deferred makes the heart sick, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>but a desire fulfilled is <f>ⓢ</f>a tree of life.</t>
13-13 <t>Whoever <f>ⓣ</f>despises <f>ⓤ</f>the word <f>[5]</f> brings destruction on himself, </t><t>but he who reveres the commandment <f>[6]</f> will be <f>ⓥ</f>rewarded.</t>
13-14 <t>The teaching of the wise is <f>ⓦ</f>a fountain of life, </t><t>that one may <f>ⓧ</f>turn away from the snares of death.</t>
13-15 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Good sense wins <f>ⓩ</f>favor, </t><t>but the way of the treacherous is their ruin. <f>[7]</f></t>
13-16 <t><f>ⓐ</f> Every prudent man acts with knowledge, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>but a fool flaunts his folly.</t>
13-17 <t>A wicked messenger falls into trouble, </t><t>but <f>ⓒ</f>a faithful envoy brings healing.</t>
13-18 <t>Poverty and disgrace come to him who <f>ⓓ</f>ignores instruction, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>but whoever <f>ⓕ</f>heeds reproof is honored.</t>
13-19 <t><f>ⓖ</f> A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul, </t><t>but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools.</t>
13-20 <t>Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, </t><t>but the companion of fools will suffer harm.</t>
13-21 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Disaster <f>[8]</f> pursues sinners, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>but the righteous are rewarded with good.</t>
13-22 <t><f>ⓙ</f> A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, </t><t>but <f>ⓚ</f>the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous.</t>
13-23 <t>The fallow ground of the poor would yield much food, </t><t>but it is swept away through <f>ⓛ</f>injustice.</t>
13-24 <t><f>ⓜ</f> Whoever spares the rod hates his son, </t><t>but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him. <f>[9]</f></t>
13-25 <t><f>ⓝ</f> The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, </t><t>but the belly of the wicked suffers want. </t>
9-1 <pb/>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
9-2 And his disciples asked him, <f>ⓐ</f>“Rabbi, <f>ⓑ</f>who sinned, <f>ⓒ</f>this man or <f>ⓓ</f>his parents, that he was born blind?”
9-3 Jesus answered, <J>“It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but <f>ⓔ</f>that the works of God might be displayed in him.</J>
9-4 <J>We must <f>ⓕ</f>work the works of him who sent me <f>ⓖ</f>while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.</J>
9-5 <J>As long as I am in the world, <f>ⓗ</f>I am the light of the world.”</J>
9-6 Having said these things, <f>ⓘ</f>he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. <f>ⓙ</f>Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud
9-7 and said to him, <J>“Go, wash in <f>ⓚ</f>the pool of Siloam”</J> (which means Sent). So he went and washed and <f>ⓛ</f>came back seeing.
9-8 <pb/>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, <f>ⓜ</f>“Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?”
9-9 Some said, “It is he.” Others said, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I am the man.”
9-10 So they said to him, “Then how were your eyes opened?”
9-11 He answered, <f>ⓝ</f>“The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, <J>‘Go to Siloam and wash.’</J> So I went and washed and received my sight.”
9-12 They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”
9-13 <pb/>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.
9-14 <f>ⓞ</f> Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
9-15 <f>ⓟ</f> So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”
9-16 Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not <f>ⓠ</f>from God, <f>ⓡ</f>for he does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, <f>ⓢ</f>“How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And <f>ⓣ</f>there was a division among them.
9-17 So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?” He said, <f>ⓤ</f>“He is a prophet.”
9-18 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> The Jews <f>[1]</f> did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight
9-19 and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
9-20 His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
9-21 But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.”
9-22 (His parents said these things <f>ⓦ</f>because they feared the Jews, for <f>ⓧ</f>the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should <f>ⓨ</f>confess Jesus <f>[2]</f> to be Christ, <f>ⓩ</f>he was to be put out of the synagogue.)
9-23 Therefore his parents said, <f>ⓐ</f>“He is of age; ask him.”
9-24 <pb/>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, <f>ⓑ</f>“Give glory to God. We know that <f>ⓒ</f>this man is a sinner.”
9-25 He answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I <f>ⓓ</f>was blind, now I see.”
9-26 They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
9-27 He answered them, <f>ⓔ</f>“I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?”
9-28 And they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but <f>ⓕ</f>we are disciples of Moses.
9-29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, <f>ⓖ</f>we do not know where he comes from.”
9-30 The man answered, “Why, this is <f>ⓗ</f>an amazing thing! <f>ⓘ</f>You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.
9-31 We know that <f>ⓙ</f>God does not listen to sinners, but <f>ⓚ</f>if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.
9-32 Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
9-33 <f>ⓛ</f> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
9-34 They answered him, <f>ⓜ</f>“You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?” And they <f>ⓝ</f>cast him out.
9-35 <pb/>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <J>“Do you believe in <f>ⓞ</f>the Son of Man?” <f>[3]</f></J>
9-36 He answered, <f>ⓟ</f>“And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?”
9-37 Jesus said to him, <J>“You have seen him, and <f>ⓠ</f>it is he who is speaking to you.”</J>
9-38 He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
9-39 Jesus said, <J> <f>ⓡ</f>“For judgment I came into this world, <f>ⓢ</f>that those who do not see may see, and <f>ⓣ</f>those who see may become blind.”</J>
9-40 Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, <f>ⓤ</f>“Are we also blind?”
9-41 Jesus said to them, <J>“If you were blind, <f>ⓥ</f>you would have no guilt; <f>[4]</f> but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your guilt remains.</J>
