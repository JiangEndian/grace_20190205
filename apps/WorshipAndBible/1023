1 Samuel 5-1 <pb/>When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it from <f>ⓐ</f>Ebenezer to <f>ⓑ</f>Ashdod.
1 Samuel 5-2 Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside <f>ⓒ</f>Dagon.
1 Samuel 5-3 And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, <f>ⓓ</f>Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.
1 Samuel 5-4 But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, <f>ⓔ</f>and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.
1 Samuel 5-5 This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon <f>ⓕ</f>do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
1 Samuel 5-6 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> The hand of the LORD was heavy against the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with <f>ⓗ</f>tumors, both Ashdod and its territory.
1 Samuel 5-7 And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god.”
1 Samuel 5-8 So they sent and gathered together all <f>ⓘ</f>the lords of the Philistines and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there.
1 Samuel 5-9 But after they had brought it around, <f>ⓙ</f>the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that <f>ⓚ</f>tumors broke out on them.
1 Samuel 5-10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But as soon as the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people.”
1 Samuel 5-11 <f>ⓛ</f> They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people.” For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. <f>ⓜ</f>The hand of God was very heavy there.
1 Samuel 5-12 The men who did not die were struck with <f>ⓝ</f>tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.

Mark 14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> It was now two days before <f>ⓑ</f>the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes <f>ⓒ</f>were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him,
Mark 14-2 for they said, “Not during the feast, <f>ⓓ</f>lest there be an uproar from the people.”
Mark 14-3 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> And while he was at <f>ⓕ</f>Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, <f>[1]</f> as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head.
Mark 14-4 There were some who said to themselves indignantly, “Why was the ointment wasted like that?
Mark 14-5 For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>given to the poor.” And they <f>ⓗ</f>scolded her.
Mark 14-6 But Jesus said, <J>“Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</J>
Mark 14-7 <J>For <f>ⓘ</f>you always have the poor with you, and whenever <f>ⓙ</f>you want, you can do good for them. But <f>ⓚ</f>you will not always have me.</J>
Mark 14-8 <J><f>ⓛ</f> She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand <f>ⓜ</f>for burial.</J>
Mark 14-9 <J>And truly, I say to you, wherever <f>ⓝ</f>the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told <f>ⓞ</f>in memory of her.”</J>
Mark 14-10 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Then <f>ⓠ</f>Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, <f>ⓡ</f>went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
Mark 14-11 And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to <f>ⓢ</f>betray him.
Mark 14-12 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> And on <f>ⓤ</f>the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they <f>ⓥ</f>sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
Mark 14-13 And he sent <f>ⓦ</f>two of his disciples and said to them, <J>“Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,</J>
Mark 14-14 <J>and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, <f>ⓧ</f>‘The Teacher says, Where is <f>ⓨ</f>my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</J>
Mark 14-15 <J>And he will show you <f>ⓩ</f>a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.”</J>
Mark 14-16 And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
Mark 14-17 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And when it was evening, he came with the twelve.
Mark 14-18 And as they were reclining at table and eating, <f>ⓑ</f>Jesus said, <J>“Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, <f>ⓒ</f>one who is eating with me.”</J>
Mark 14-19 They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?”
Mark 14-20 He said to them, <J>“It is <f>ⓓ</f>one of the twelve, <f>ⓔ</f>one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.</J>
Mark 14-21 <J>For the Son of Man goes <f>ⓕ</f>as it is written of him, but <f>ⓖ</f>woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! <f>ⓗ</f>It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”</J>
Mark 14-22 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> And as they were eating, he took bread, and after <f>ⓙ</f>blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, <J>“Take; <f>ⓚ</f>this is my body.”</J>
Mark 14-23 And he took a cup, and when he had <f>ⓛ</f>given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.
Mark 14-24 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“This is my <f>ⓝ</f>blood of the <f>[3]</f> covenant, which is poured out for <f>ⓞ</f>many.</J>
Mark 14-25 <J>Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</J>
Mark 14-26 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> And when they had sung a hymn, <f>ⓠ</f>they went out to <f>ⓡ</f>the Mount of Olives.
Mark 14-27 And Jesus said to them, <J>“You will all fall away, for it is written, ‘I will <f>ⓢ</f>strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’</J>
Mark 14-28 <J>But after I am raised up, <f>ⓣ</f>I will go before you to Galilee.”</J>
Mark 14-29 <f>ⓤ</f> Peter said to him, “Even though they all fall away, I will not.”
Mark 14-30 And <f>ⓥ</f>Jesus said to him, <J>“Truly, I tell you, this very night, before <f>ⓦ</f>the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”</J>
Mark 14-31 But <f>ⓧ</f>he said emphatically, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all said the same.
Mark 14-32 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> And they went <f>ⓩ</f>to a place called Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples, <J>“Sit here while I pray.”</J>
Mark 14-33 And he took with him <f>ⓐ</f>Peter and James and John, and began <f>ⓑ</f>to be greatly distressed and troubled.
Mark 14-34 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and <f>ⓓ</f>watch.” <f>[4]</f></J>
Mark 14-35 And going a little farther, he fell on the ground <f>ⓔ</f>and prayed that, if it were possible, <f>ⓕ</f>the hour might pass from him.
Mark 14-36 And he said, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Abba, Father, <f>ⓗ</f>all things are possible for you. Remove <f>ⓘ</f>this cup from me. <f>ⓙ</f>Yet not what I will, but what you will.”</J>
Mark 14-37 And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, <J>“Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</J>
Mark 14-38 <J><f>ⓚ</f> Watch and <f>ⓛ</f>pray that you may not <f>ⓜ</f>enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</J>
Mark 14-39 And again he went away and prayed, <f>ⓝ</f>saying the same words.
Mark 14-40 And again he came and found them sleeping, for <f>ⓞ</f>their eyes were very heavy, and <f>ⓟ</f>they did not know what to answer him.
Mark 14-41 And he came the third time and said to them, <J>“Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? <f>ⓠ</f>It is enough; <f>ⓡ</f>the hour has come. <f>ⓢ</f>The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</J>
Mark 14-42 <J>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”</J>
Mark 14-43 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> And immediately, while he was still speaking, <f>ⓤ</f>Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark 14-44 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard.”
Mark 14-45 And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, <f>ⓥ</f>“Rabbi!” And he <f>ⓦ</f>kissed him.
Mark 14-46 And they laid hands on him and seized him.
Mark 14-47 But one of those who stood by drew his <f>ⓧ</f>sword and struck the servant <f>[5]</f> of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Mark 14-48 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?</J>
Mark 14-49 <J><f>ⓨ</f> Day after day I was with you in the temple <f>ⓩ</f>teaching, and you did not seize me. But <f>ⓐ</f>let the Scriptures be fulfilled.”</J>
Mark 14-50 <f>ⓑ</f> And they all left him and fled.
Mark 14-51 <pb/>And a young man followed him, with nothing but <f>ⓒ</f>a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him,
Mark 14-52 but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
Mark 14-53 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> And <f>ⓔ</f>they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.
Mark 14-54 <f>ⓕ</f> And <f>ⓖ</f>Peter had followed him at a distance, <f>ⓗ</f>right into <f>ⓘ</f>the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with <f>ⓙ</f>the guards and <f>ⓚ</f>warming himself at the fire.
Mark 14-55 Now the chief priests and the whole council <f>[6]</f> were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.
Mark 14-56 <f>ⓛ</f> For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony <f>ⓜ</f>did not agree.
Mark 14-57 And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
Mark 14-58 <f>ⓝ</f> “We heard him say, <f>ⓞ</f>‘I will destroy this temple <f>ⓟ</f>that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, <f>ⓠ</f>not made with hands.’”
Mark 14-59 Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.
Mark 14-60 And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?” <f>[7]</f>
Mark 14-61 But <f>ⓡ</f>he remained silent and made no answer. <f>ⓢ</f>Again the high priest asked him, “Are you <f>ⓣ</f>the Christ, the Son of <f>ⓤ</f>the Blessed?”
Mark 14-62 And Jesus said, <J>“I am, and <f>ⓥ</f>you will see the Son of Man <f>ⓦ</f>seated at the right hand of Power, and <f>ⓧ</f>coming with the clouds of heaven.”</J>
Mark 14-63 And the high priest <f>ⓨ</f>tore his garments and said, “What further witnesses do we need?
Mark 14-64 You have heard <f>ⓩ</f>his blasphemy. What is your decision?” And they <f>ⓐ</f>all condemned him as <f>ⓑ</f>deserving death.
Mark 14-65 <f>ⓒ</f> And some began <f>ⓓ</f>to spit on him and <f>ⓔ</f>to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards received him <f>ⓕ</f>with blows.
Mark 14-66 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,
Mark 14-67 and seeing Peter <f>ⓗ</f>warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”
Mark 14-68 But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean.” And he went out into the gateway <f>[8]</f> and <f>ⓘ</f>the rooster crowed. <f>[9]</f>
Mark 14-69 And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”
Mark 14-70 But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, “Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.”
Mark 14-71 But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak.”
Mark 14-72 And immediately the rooster crowed <f>ⓙ</f>a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“Before the rooster crows twice, you will <f>ⓛ</f>deny me three times.”</J> And he broke down and wept. <f>[10]</f>
