6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of <f>ⓑ</f>Midian seven years.
6-2 And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and <f>ⓒ</f>the caves and the strongholds.
6-3 For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and <f>ⓓ</f>the Amalekites and <f>ⓔ</f>the people of the East would come up against them.
6-4 They would encamp against them <f>ⓕ</f>and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey.
6-5 For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come <f>ⓖ</f>like locusts in number — both they and their camels could not be counted — so that they laid waste the land as they came in.
6-6 And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel <f>ⓗ</f>cried out for help to the LORD.
6-7 <pb/>When the people of Israel cried out to the LORD on account of the Midianites,
6-8 the LORD sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: <f>ⓘ</f>I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery.
6-9 And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and <f>ⓙ</f>drove them out before you and gave you their land.
6-10 And I said to you, ‘I am the LORD your God; <f>ⓚ</f>you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.’ But you have not obeyed my voice.”
6-11 <pb/>Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash <f>ⓛ</f>the Abiezrite, while his son <f>ⓜ</f>Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites.
6-12 And <f>ⓝ</f>the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, <f>ⓞ</f>“The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor.”
6-13 And Gideon said to him, “Please, my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are <f>ⓟ</f>all his wonderful deeds <f>ⓠ</f>that our fathers recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.”
6-14 And the LORD <f>[1]</f> turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; <f>ⓡ</f>do not I send you?”
6-15 And he said to him, <f>ⓢ</f>“Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, <f>ⓣ</f>my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.”
6-16 And the LORD said to him, <f>ⓤ</f>“But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.”
6-17 And he said to him, <f>ⓥ</f>“If now I have found favor in your eyes, then <f>ⓦ</f>show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.
6-18 Please <f>ⓧ</f>do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.” And he said, “I will stay till you return.”
6-19 <pb/>So Gideon went into his house <f>ⓨ</f>and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah <f>[2]</f> of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them.
6-20 And the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them <f>ⓩ</f>on this rock, and <f>ⓐ</f>pour the broth over them.” And he did so.
6-21 Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. <f>ⓑ</f>And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.
6-22 Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD. And Gideon said, <f>ⓒ</f>“Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.”
6-23 But the LORD said to him, <f>ⓓ</f>“Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.”
6-24 Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, <f>ⓔ</f>The LORD Is Peace. To this day it still stands at <f>ⓕ</f>Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.
6-25 <pb/>That night the LORD said to him, “Take your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down <f>ⓖ</f>the Asherah that is beside it
6-26 and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the <f>ⓗ</f>stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.”
6-27 So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.
6-28 <pb/>When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built.
6-29 And they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” And after they had searched and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.”
6-30 Then the men of the town said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.”
6-31 But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down.”
6-32 Therefore on that day Gideon <f>[3]</f> was called <f>ⓘ</f>Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he broke down his altar.
6-33 <pb/>Now <f>ⓙ</f>all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in <f>ⓚ</f>the Valley of Jezreel.
6-34 But <f>ⓛ</f>the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, <f>ⓜ</f>and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him.
6-35 <f>ⓝ</f> And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. <f>ⓞ</f>And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.
6-36 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Then Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,
6-37 behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.”
6-38 And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.
6-39 Then Gideon said to God, <f>ⓠ</f>“Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew.”
6-40 And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.
104-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Bless the LORD, O my soul! </t><t>O LORD my God, you are <f>ⓑ</f>very great! </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>You are clothed with splendor and majesty,</t>
104-2 <t>covering yourself with light as with a garment, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>stretching out the heavens <f>ⓔ</f>like a tent.</t>
104-3 <t>He <f>ⓕ</f>lays the beams of his <f>ⓖ</f>chambers on the waters; </t><t>he makes <f>ⓗ</f>the clouds his chariot; </t><t>he rides on <f>ⓘ</f>the wings of the wind;</t>
104-4 <t>he <f>ⓙ</f>makes his messengers winds, </t><t>his <f>ⓚ</f>ministers <f>ⓛ</f>a flaming fire. </t>
104-5 <pb/><t>He <f>ⓜ</f>set the earth on its foundations, </t><t>so that it should never be moved.</t>
104-6 <t>You <f>ⓝ</f>covered it with the deep as with a garment; </t><t>the waters stood above the mountains.</t>
104-7 <t>At <f>ⓞ</f>your rebuke they fled; </t><t>at <f>ⓟ</f>the sound of your thunder they <f>ⓠ</f>took to flight.</t>
104-8 <t>The mountains rose, the valleys sank down </t><t>to the place that you <f>ⓡ</f>appointed for them.</t>
104-9 <t>You set <f>ⓢ</f>a boundary that they may not pass, </t><t>so that they <f>ⓣ</f>might not again cover the earth. </t>
104-10 <pb/><t>You make springs gush forth in the valleys; </t><t>they flow between the hills;</t>
104-11 <t>they <f>ⓤ</f>give drink to every beast of the field; </t><t>the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</t>
104-12 <t>Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; </t><t>they sing among the branches.</t>
104-13 <t><f>ⓥ</f> From your lofty abode you <f>ⓦ</f>water the mountains; </t><t>the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work. </t>
104-14 <pb/><t>You cause <f>ⓧ</f>the grass to grow for the livestock </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>plants for man to cultivate, </t><t>that he may bring forth <f>ⓩ</f>food from the earth</t>
104-15 <t>and <f>ⓐ</f>wine to gladden the heart of man, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>oil to make his face shine </t><t>and bread to <f>ⓒ</f>strengthen man's heart. </t>
104-16 <pb/><t>The trees of the LORD are watered abundantly, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>the cedars of Lebanon <f>ⓔ</f>that he planted.</t>
104-17 <t>In them the birds build their nests; </t><t>the stork has her home in the fir trees.</t>
104-18 <t>The high mountains are for <f>ⓕ</f>the wild goats; </t><t>the rocks are a refuge for <f>ⓖ</f>the rock badgers. </t>
104-19 <pb/><t>He made the moon to mark the <f>ⓗ</f>seasons; <f>[1]</f> </t><t>the sun knows its time for setting.</t>
104-20 <t><f>ⓘ</f> You make darkness, and it is night, </t><t>when all the beasts of the forest creep about.</t>
104-21 <t><f>ⓙ</f> The young lions roar for their prey, </t><t>seeking their food from God.</t>
104-22 <t>When the sun rises, they steal away </t><t>and lie down in their <f>ⓚ</f>dens.</t>
104-23 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Man goes out to his work </t><t>and to his labor until the evening. </t>
104-24 <pb/><t>O LORD, how manifold are your works! </t><t>In <f>ⓜ</f>wisdom have you made them all; </t><t>the earth is full of your creatures.</t>
104-25 <t>Here is the sea, great and wide, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>which teems with creatures innumerable, </t><t>living things both small and great.</t>

104-27 <pb/><t>These <f>ⓠ</f>all look to you, </t><t>to <f>ⓡ</f>give them their food in due season.</t>
104-28 <t>When you give it to them, they gather it up; </t><t>when you <f>ⓢ</f>open your hand, they are filled with good things.</t>
104-29 <t>When you <f>ⓣ</f>hide your face, they are <f>ⓤ</f>dismayed; </t><t>when you <f>ⓥ</f>take away their breath, they die </t><t>and <f>ⓦ</f>return to their dust.</t>
104-30 <t>When you <f>ⓧ</f>send forth your Spirit, <f>[3]</f> they are created, </t><t>and you <f>ⓨ</f>renew the face of the ground. </t>

18-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
18-2 And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them
18-3 and said, <J>“Truly, I say to you, unless you <f>ⓑ</f>turn and <f>ⓒ</f>become like children, you <f>ⓓ</f>will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</J>
18-4 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Whoever humbles himself like this child is the <f>ⓕ</f>greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</J>
18-5 <pb/><J><f>ⓖ</f> “Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me,</J>
18-6 <J>but <f>ⓗ</f>whoever causes one of these <f>ⓘ</f>little ones who believe in me to sin, <f>[1]</f> it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.</J>
18-7 <pb/><J>“Woe to the world for <f>ⓙ</f>temptations to sin! <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>For it is necessary that temptations come, <f>ⓛ</f>but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes!</J>
18-8 <J><f>ⓜ</f> And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into <f>ⓝ</f>the eternal fire.</J>
18-9 <J><f>ⓞ</f> And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the <f>ⓟ</f>hell <f>[3]</f> of fire.</J>
18-10 <pb/><J>“See that you do not despise <f>ⓠ</f>one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven <f>ⓡ</f>their angels always <f>ⓢ</f>see the face of my Father who is in heaven. <f>[4]</f></J>
18-11 
18-12 <J><f>ⓣ</f> What do you think? <f>ⓤ</f>If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?</J>
18-13 <J>And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray.</J>
18-14 <J>So <f>ⓥ</f>it is not the will of my <f>[5]</f> Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</J>
18-15 <pb/><J><f>ⓦ</f> “If your brother sins against you, <f>ⓧ</f>go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have <f>ⓨ</f>gained your brother.</J>
18-16 <J>But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established <f>ⓩ</f>by the evidence of two or three witnesses.</J>
18-17 <J>If he refuses to listen to them, <f>ⓐ</f>tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, <f>ⓑ</f>let him be to you as <f>ⓒ</f>a Gentile and <f>ⓓ</f>a tax collector.</J>
18-18 <J>Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓔ</f>whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed <f>[6]</f> in heaven.</J>
18-19 <J>Again I say to you, if two of you <f>ⓕ</f>agree on earth about anything they ask, <f>ⓖ</f>it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.</J>

18-21 <pb/>Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how often <f>ⓙ</f>will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? <f>ⓚ</f>As many as seven times?”
18-22 Jesus said to him, <J>“I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.</J>
18-23 <pb/><J>“Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished <f>ⓛ</f>to settle accounts with his servants. <f>[7]</f></J>
18-24 <J>When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him <f>ⓜ</f>ten thousand <f>ⓝ</f>talents. <f>[8]</f></J>
18-25 <J><f>ⓞ</f> And since he could not pay, his master ordered him <f>ⓟ</f>to be sold, with his wife and <f>ⓠ</f>children and all that he had, and payment to be made.</J>
18-26 <J>So the servant <f>[9]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>fell on his knees, imploring him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’</J>
18-27 <J>And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and <f>ⓢ</f>forgave him the debt.</J>
18-28 <J>But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred <f>ⓣ</f>denarii, <f>[10]</f> and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’</J>
18-29 <J>So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’</J>
18-30 <J>He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt.</J>
18-31 <J>When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place.</J>
18-32 <J>Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.</J>
18-33 <J><f>ⓤ</f> And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?’</J>
18-34 <J><f>ⓥ</f> And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, <f>[11]</f> <f>ⓦ</f>until he should pay all his debt.</J>
18-35 <J><f>ⓧ</f> So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother <f>ⓨ</f>from your heart.”</J>
