Leviticus 8-7 And he put <f>ⓔ</f>the coat on him and tied the sash around his waist and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him and tied the skillfully woven band of the ephod around him, binding it to him with the band. <f>[1]</f>

Leviticus 8-27 And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the LORD.

Leviticus 8-31 <pb/>And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’
Leviticus 8-32 And what remains of the flesh and the bread you shall burn up with fire.
Leviticus 8-33 And you shall not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for it <f>ⓤ</f>will take seven days to ordain you.

Job 27-15 <t>Those who survive him the pestilence buries, </t><t>and his <f>ⓢ</f>widows do not weep.</t>
Job 27-16 <t>Though he <f>ⓣ</f>heap up silver like dust, </t><t>and pile up clothing like clay,</t>
Job 27-17 <t>he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>the innocent will divide the silver.</t>

Ezekiel 26-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 26-2 <f>ⓑ</f> “Son of man, because <f>ⓒ</f>Tyre said concerning Jerusalem, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Aha, the gate of the peoples is broken; it has swung open to me. I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste,’
Ezekiel 26-3 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓔ</f>Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will bring up <f>ⓕ</f>many nations against you, <f>ⓖ</f>as the sea brings up its waves.
Ezekiel 26-4 They shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers, and I will scrape her soil from her and <f>ⓗ</f>make her a bare rock.
Ezekiel 26-5 She <f>ⓘ</f>shall be in the midst of the sea a place for the spreading of nets, <f>ⓙ</f>for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD. And she shall become plunder for the nations,
Ezekiel 26-6 and her daughters on the mainland shall be killed by the sword. <f>ⓚ</f>Then they will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 26-7 <pb/>“For thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓛ</f>Behold, I will bring against Tyre <f>ⓜ</f>from the north Nebuchadnezzar <f>[1]</f> king of Babylon, <f>ⓝ</f>king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with horsemen and a host of many soldiers.
Ezekiel 26-8 He will kill with the sword <f>ⓞ</f>your daughters on the mainland. <f>ⓟ</f>He will set up a siege wall against you and throw up a mound against you, and raise <f>ⓠ</f>a roof of shields against you.
Ezekiel 26-9 <f>ⓡ</f> He will direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.
Ezekiel 26-10 His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wagons and chariots, when he enters your gates as men enter a city that has been breached.
Ezekiel 26-11 With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground.
Ezekiel 26-12 They will plunder <f>ⓢ</f>your riches and loot <f>ⓣ</f>your merchandise. They will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. Your stones and timber and <f>ⓤ</f>soil they will cast into the midst of the waters.
Ezekiel 26-13 <f>ⓥ</f> And I will stop the music of your songs, and <f>ⓦ</f>the sound of your lyres shall be heard no more.
Ezekiel 26-14 <f>ⓧ</f> I will make you a bare rock. <f>ⓨ</f>You shall be a place for the spreading of nets. You shall never be rebuilt, <f>ⓩ</f>for I am the LORD; I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 26-15 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre: Will not <f>ⓐ</f>the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, <f>ⓑ</f>when the wounded groan, when slaughter is made in your midst?
Ezekiel 26-16 Then all <f>ⓒ</f>the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones and <f>ⓓ</f>remove their robes and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; <f>ⓔ</f>they will sit on the ground and <f>ⓕ</f>tremble every moment and <f>ⓖ</f>be appalled at you.
Ezekiel 26-17 And they will <f>ⓗ</f>raise a lamentation over you and say to you, <pb/><t>“‘How you have perished, </t><t>you who were inhabited from the seas, </t><t>O city renowned, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>who was mighty on the sea; </t><t>she and her inhabitants <f>ⓙ</f>imposed their terror </t><t>on all her inhabitants!</t>
Ezekiel 26-18 <t>Now the coastlands tremble </t><t>on the day of your fall, </t><t>and the coastlands that are on the sea </t><t>are dismayed at your passing.’ </t>
Ezekiel 26-19 <pb/>“For thus says the Lord GOD: When I make you a city laid waste, like the cities that are not inhabited, <f>ⓚ</f>when I bring up the deep over you, and the great waters cover you,
Ezekiel 26-20 then <f>ⓛ</f>I will make you go down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of old, and I will make you to dwell in the world below, among ruins from of old, <f>ⓜ</f>with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not be inhabited; but I will set beauty <f>ⓝ</f>in the land of the living.
Ezekiel 26-21 I will bring you <f>ⓞ</f>to a dreadful end, and you shall be no more. <f>ⓟ</f>Though you be sought for, you will never be found again, declares the Lord GOD.”
