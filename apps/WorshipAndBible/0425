Exodus 10-1 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these signs of mine among them,
Exodus 10-2 and <f>ⓐ</f>that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson how I have dealt harshly with the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them, <f>ⓑ</f>that you may know that I am the LORD.”
Exodus 10-3 <pb/>So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, ‘How long will you refuse to <f>ⓒ</f>humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus 10-4 For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring <f>ⓓ</f>locusts into your country,
Exodus 10-5 and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land. And they shall <f>ⓔ</f>eat what is left to you after the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field,
Exodus 10-6 and they shall fill <f>ⓕ</f>your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.’” Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
Exodus 10-7 <pb/>Then Pharaoh's servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?”
Exodus 10-8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, <f>ⓖ</f>“Go, serve the LORD your God. But which ones are to go?”
Exodus 10-9 Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for <f>ⓗ</f>we must hold a feast to the LORD.”
Exodus 10-10 But he said to them, “The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your <f>ⓘ</f>little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind. <f>[1]</f>
Exodus 10-11 No! Go, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you are asking.” And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
Exodus 10-12 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓙ</f>“Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come upon the land of Egypt and <f>ⓚ</f>eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left.”
Exodus 10-13 So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind had brought the locusts.
Exodus 10-14 <f>ⓛ</f> The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on the whole country of Egypt, <f>ⓜ</f>such a dense swarm of locusts as had never been before, nor ever will be again.
Exodus 10-15 They covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened, and <f>ⓝ</f>they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
Exodus 10-16 Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said, <f>ⓞ</f>“I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
Exodus 10-17 Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once, and <f>ⓟ</f>plead with the LORD your God only to remove this death from me.”
Exodus 10-18 So <f>ⓠ</f>he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD.
Exodus 10-19 And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them <f>ⓡ</f>into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt.
Exodus 10-20 But the LORD <f>ⓢ</f>hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go.
Exodus 10-21 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓣ</f>“Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be <f>ⓤ</f>darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be felt.”
Exodus 10-22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was pitch darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
Exodus 10-23 They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but <f>ⓥ</f>all the people of Israel had light where they lived.
Exodus 10-24 Then Pharaoh called Moses and said, <f>ⓦ</f>“Go, serve the LORD; <f>ⓧ</f>your little ones also may go with you; only let your flocks and your herds remain behind.”
Exodus 10-25 But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
Exodus 10-26 Our livestock also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we must take of them to serve the LORD our God, and we do not know with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there.”
Exodus 10-27 But the LORD <f>ⓨ</f>hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
Exodus 10-28 Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me; take care never to see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die.”
Exodus 10-29 Moses said, “As you say! <f>ⓩ</f>I will not see your face again.”

Nehemiah 12-26 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and in the days of <f>ⓞ</f>Nehemiah the governor and of <f>ⓟ</f>Ezra, the priest and scribe.
Nehemiah 12-27 <pb/>And at <f>ⓠ</f>the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, with thanksgivings and with singing, <f>ⓡ</f>with cymbals, harps, and lyres.
Nehemiah 12-28 And the sons of the singers gathered together from the district surrounding Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites;
Nehemiah 12-29 also from Beth-gilgal and from the region of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built for themselves villages around Jerusalem.
Nehemiah 12-30 And the priests and the Levites <f>ⓢ</f>purified themselves, and they purified the people and the gates and the wall.
Nehemiah 12-31 <pb/>Then I brought the leaders of Judah up onto the wall and appointed two great choirs that gave thanks. <f>ⓣ</f>One went to the south on the wall to <f>ⓤ</f>the Dung Gate.
Nehemiah 12-32 And after them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah,
Nehemiah 12-33 and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
Nehemiah 12-34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

Nehemiah 12-36 and his relatives, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, <f>ⓦ</f>with the musical instruments of David <f>ⓧ</f>the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them.
Nehemiah 12-37 At <f>ⓨ</f>the Fountain Gate they went up straight before them by <f>ⓩ</f>the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, to <f>ⓐ</f>the Water Gate on the east.
Nehemiah 12-38 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> The other choir of those who gave thanks went to the north, and I followed them with half of the people, on the wall, above <f>ⓒ</f>the Tower of the Ovens, to <f>ⓓ</f>the Broad Wall,
Nehemiah 12-39 and above <f>ⓔ</f>the Gate of Ephraim, and by <f>ⓕ</f>the Gate of Yeshanah, <f>[1]</f> and by <f>ⓖ</f>the Fish Gate and <f>ⓗ</f>the Tower of Hananel and <f>ⓘ</f>the Tower of the Hundred, to <f>ⓙ</f>the Sheep Gate; and they came to a halt at <f>ⓚ</f>the Gate of the Guard.

Nehemiah 12-43 And they offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and children also rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.
Nehemiah 12-44 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> On that day men were appointed over the storerooms, the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required by the Law for the priests and for the Levites according to the fields of the towns, for Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who ministered.

Jeremiah 45-1 <pb/>The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to <f>ⓐ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah, <f>ⓑ</f>when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, <f>ⓒ</f>in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
Jeremiah 45-2 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
Jeremiah 45-3 You said, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain. <f>ⓔ</f>I am weary with my groaning, <f>ⓕ</f>and I find no rest.’
Jeremiah 45-4 Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓖ</f>Behold, what I have built I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am plucking up — that is, the whole land.
Jeremiah 45-5 And <f>ⓗ</f>do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the LORD. But I will give you <f>ⓙ</f>your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go.”
1 Peter 5-1 <pb/>So I exhort the elders among you, <f>ⓐ</f>as a fellow elder and <f>ⓑ</f>a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:
1 Peter 5-2 <f>ⓒ</f> shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
1 Peter 5-3 not <f>ⓕ</f>domineering over those in your charge, but <f>ⓖ</f>being examples to the flock.
1 Peter 5-4 And when <f>ⓗ</f>the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the <f>ⓘ</f>unfading <f>ⓙ</f>crown of glory.
1 Peter 5-5 Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. <f>ⓚ</f>Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for <f>ⓛ</f>“God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”
1 Peter 5-6 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,
1 Peter 5-7 <f>ⓝ</f> casting all your anxieties on him, because <f>ⓞ</f>he cares for you.
1 Peter 5-8 <f>ⓟ</f> Be sober-minded; <f>ⓠ</f>be watchful. Your <f>ⓡ</f>adversary the devil <f>ⓢ</f>prowls around <f>ⓣ</f>like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
1 Peter 5-9 <f>ⓤ</f> Resist him, <f>ⓥ</f>firm in your faith, knowing that <f>ⓦ</f>the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.
1 Peter 5-10 And <f>ⓧ</f>after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, <f>ⓨ</f>who has called you to his <f>ⓩ</f>eternal glory in Christ, will himself <f>ⓐ</f>restore, <f>ⓑ</f>confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
1 Peter 5-11 <f>ⓒ</f> To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter 5-12 <pb/>By <f>ⓓ</f>Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, <f>ⓔ</f>I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is <f>ⓕ</f>the true grace of God. <f>ⓖ</f>Stand firm in it.
1 Peter 5-13 She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does <f>ⓗ</f>Mark, my son.
1 Peter 5-14 <f>ⓘ</f> Greet one another with the kiss of love. <pb/><f>ⓙ</f>Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
