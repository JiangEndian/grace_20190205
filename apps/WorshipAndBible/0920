21-1 <pb/>Then the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites came <f>ⓐ</f>to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel.
21-2 And they said to them <f>ⓑ</f>at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, <f>ⓒ</f>“The LORD commanded through Moses that we be given cities to dwell in, along with their pasturelands for our livestock.”
21-3 So by command of the LORD the people of Israel gave to the Levites the following cities and pasturelands out of their inheritance.
21-4 <pb/>The lot came out for the clans of the Kohathites. So those Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest <f>ⓓ</f>received by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, thirteen cities.
21-5 <pb/>And the rest of the Kohathites received by lot <f>ⓔ</f>from the clans of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan and the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
21-6 <pb/>The <f>ⓕ</f>Gershonites received by lot from the clans of the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
21-7 <pb/>The <f>ⓖ</f>Merarites according to their clans received from the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
21-8 <pb/>These cities and their pasturelands the people of Israel <f>ⓗ</f>gave by lot to the Levites, <f>ⓘ</f>as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
21-9 <pb/>Out of the tribe of the people of Judah and the tribe of the people of Simeon they gave the following cities mentioned by name,
21-10 which went to <f>ⓙ</f>the descendants of Aaron, one of the clans of the Kohathites who belonged to the people of Levi; since the lot fell to them first.
21-11 <f>ⓚ</f> They gave them <f>ⓛ</f>Kiriath-arba (Arba being the father of Anak), that is Hebron, <f>ⓜ</f>in the hill country of Judah, along with the pasturelands around it.
21-12 But the fields of the city and its villages had been given to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
21-13 <pb/>And to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, <f>ⓝ</f>the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasturelands, <f>ⓞ</f>Libnah with its pasturelands,
21-14 Jattir with its pasturelands, Eshtemoa with its pasturelands,
21-15 Holon with its pasturelands, Debir with its pasturelands,
21-16 Ain with its pasturelands, Juttah with its pasturelands, Beth-shemesh with its pasturelands — nine cities out of these two tribes;
21-17 then out of the tribe of Benjamin, <f>ⓟ</f>Gibeon with its pasturelands, Geba with its pasturelands,
21-18 Anathoth with its pasturelands, and Almon with its pasturelands — four cities.
21-19 The cities of the descendants of Aaron, the priests, were in all thirteen cities with their pasturelands.
21-20 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> As to the rest of the Kohathites belonging to the Kohathite clans of the Levites, the cities allotted to them were out of the tribe of Ephraim.
21-21 To them were given Shechem, <f>ⓡ</f>the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasturelands in the hill country of Ephraim, Gezer with its pasturelands,
21-22 Kibzaim with its pasturelands, Beth-horon with its pasturelands — four cities;
21-23 and out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its pasturelands, Gibbethon with its pasturelands,
21-24 Aijalon with its pasturelands, Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands — four cities;
21-25 and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its pasturelands, and Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands — two cities.
21-26 The cities of the clans of the rest of the Kohathites were ten in all with their pasturelands.
21-27 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> And to the Gershonites, one of the clans of the Levites, were given out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan with its pasturelands, <f>ⓣ</f>the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Beeshterah with its pasturelands — two cities;
21-28 and out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its pasturelands, Daberath with its pasturelands,
21-29 Jarmuth with its pasturelands, En-gannim with its pasturelands — four cities;
21-30 and out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its pasturelands, Abdon with its pasturelands,
21-31 Helkath with its pasturelands, and Rehob with its pasturelands — four cities;
21-32 and out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its pasturelands, <f>ⓤ</f>the city of refuge for the manslayer, Hammoth-dor with its pasturelands, and Kartan with its pasturelands — three cities.
21-33 The cities of the several clans of the Gershonites were in all thirteen cities with their pasturelands.
21-34 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> And to the rest of the Levites, the Merarite clans, were given out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasturelands, Kartah with its pasturelands,
21-35 Dimnah with its pasturelands, Nahalal with its pasturelands — four cities;
21-36 and out of the tribe of Reuben, <f>ⓦ</f>Bezer with its pasturelands, Jahaz with its pasturelands,
21-37 Kedemoth with its pasturelands, and Mephaath with its pasturelands — four cities;

21-39 <f>ⓩ</f> Heshbon with its pasturelands, Jazer with its pasturelands — four cities in all.
21-40 As for the cities of the several Merarite clans, that is, the remainder of the clans of the Levites, those allotted to them were in all twelve cities.
21-41 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the people of Israel were in all forty-eight cities with their pasturelands.
21-42 These cities each had its pasturelands around it. So it was with all these cities.
21-43 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Thus the LORD gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their fathers. And they took possession of it, and they settled there.
21-44 <f>ⓒ</f> And the LORD gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their fathers. <f>ⓓ</f>Not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD had given all their enemies into their hands.
21-45 <f>ⓕ</f> Not one word of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.
95-1 <pb/><t>Oh come, let us sing to the LORD; </t><t>let us <f>ⓐ</f>make a joyful noise to <f>ⓑ</f>the rock of our salvation!</t>
95-2 <t>Let us <f>ⓒ</f>come into his presence with thanksgiving; </t><t>let us <f>ⓓ</f>make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!</t>
95-3 <t>For the LORD is <f>ⓔ</f>a great God, </t><t>and a great King <f>ⓕ</f>above all gods.</t>
95-4 <t>In his hand are the depths of the earth; </t><t>the heights of the mountains are his also.</t>
95-5 <t>The sea is his, for <f>ⓖ</f>he made it, </t><t>and his hands formed <f>ⓗ</f>the dry land. </t>
95-6 <pb/><t>Oh come, let us worship and bow down; </t><t>let us <f>ⓘ</f>kneel before the LORD, our <f>ⓙ</f>Maker!</t>
95-7 <t>For he is our <f>ⓚ</f>God, </t><t>and we are the people of his <f>ⓛ</f>pasture, </t><t>and the sheep of his hand. </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>Today, if you <f>ⓝ</f>hear his voice,</t>
95-8 <t><f>ⓞ</f> do not harden your hearts, as at <f>ⓟ</f>Meribah, </t><t>as on the day at <f>ⓠ</f>Massah in the wilderness,</t>
95-9 <t>when your fathers put me to the <f>ⓡ</f>test </t><t>and put me to the proof, though they had seen my <f>ⓢ</f>work.</t>
95-10 <t><f>ⓣ</f> For forty years I loathed that generation </t><t>and said, “They are a people who go astray in their heart, </t><t>and they have not known <f>ⓤ</f>my ways.”</t>
95-11 <t>Therefore I <f>ⓥ</f>swore in my wrath, </t><t>“They shall not enter <f>ⓦ</f>my rest.” </t>
9-1 <pb/>And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to <f>ⓐ</f>his own city.
9-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus <f>ⓒ</f>saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Take heart, my son; <f>ⓔ</f>your sins are forgiven.”</J>
9-3 And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, <f>ⓕ</f>“This man is blaspheming.”
9-4 But Jesus, <f>ⓖ</f>knowing <f>[1]</f> their thoughts, said, <J>“Why do you think evil in your hearts?</J>
9-5 <J>For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?</J>
9-6 <J>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</J> — he then said to the paralytic — <J>“Rise, pick up your bed and go home.”</J>
9-7 And he rose and went home.
9-8 When the crowds saw it, <f>ⓗ</f>they were afraid, and <f>ⓘ</f>they glorified God, who had <f>ⓙ</f>given such authority to men.
9-9 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called <f>ⓛ</f>Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, <J>“Follow me.”</J> And he rose and followed him.
9-10 <pb/>And as Jesus <f>[2]</f> reclined at table in the house, behold, many <f>ⓜ</f>tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples.
9-11 And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, <f>ⓝ</f>“Why does your teacher eat with <f>ⓞ</f>tax collectors and sinners?”
9-12 But when he heard it, he said, <J>“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</J>
9-13 <J>Go and learn <f>ⓟ</f>what this means: <f>ⓠ</f>‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For <f>ⓡ</f>I came not to call the righteous, <f>ⓢ</f>but sinners.”</J>
9-14 <pb/>Then <f>ⓣ</f>the disciples of John came to him, saying, <f>ⓤ</f>“Why do we and <f>ⓥ</f>the Pharisees fast, <f>[3]</f> but your disciples do not fast?”
9-15 And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓦ</f>“Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? <f>ⓧ</f>The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and <f>ⓨ</f>then they will fast.</J>
9-16 <J>No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.</J>
9-17 <J>Neither is new wine put into old <f>ⓩ</f>wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.”</J>
9-18 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and <f>ⓑ</f>knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
9-19 And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples.
9-20 And behold, a woman <f>ⓒ</f>who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched <f>ⓓ</f>the fringe of his garment,
9-21 for she said to herself, “If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.”
9-22 Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.”</J> <f>ⓕ</f>And instantly <f>[4]</f> the woman was made well.
9-23 And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw <f>ⓖ</f>the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
9-24 he said, <J>“Go away, for <f>ⓗ</f>the girl is not dead but <f>ⓘ</f>sleeping.”</J> And they laughed at him.
9-25 But <f>ⓙ</f>when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and <f>ⓚ</f>took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
9-26 And the report of this went through all that district.
9-27 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, “Have mercy on us, <f>ⓜ</f>Son of David.”
9-28 When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, <J>“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</J> They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”
9-29 <f>ⓝ</f> Then he touched their eyes, saying, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“According to your faith be it done to you.”</J>
9-30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“See that no one knows about it.”</J>
9-31 <f>ⓠ</f> But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.
9-32 <pb/>As they were going away, behold, a <f>ⓡ</f>demon-oppressed man who was mute <f>ⓢ</f>was brought to him.
9-33 And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds <f>ⓣ</f>marveled, saying, “Never was anything like this seen in Israel.”
9-34 But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the prince of demons.”
9-35 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction.
9-36 <f>ⓥ</f> When he saw the crowds, <f>ⓦ</f>he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, <f>ⓧ</f>like sheep without a shepherd.
9-37 <f>ⓨ</f> Then he said to his disciples, <J>“The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;</J>
9-38 <J>therefore <f>ⓩ</f>pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to <f>ⓐ</f>send out laborers into his harvest.”</J>
