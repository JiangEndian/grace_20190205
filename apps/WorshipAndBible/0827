Deuteronomy 31-1 <pb/>So Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel.
Deuteronomy 31-2 And he said to them, “I am <f>ⓐ</f>120 years old today. I am no longer able to <f>ⓑ</f>go out and come in. The LORD has said to me, <f>ⓒ</f>‘You shall not go over this Jordan.’
Deuteronomy 31-3 The LORD your God <f>ⓓ</f>himself will go over before you. He will destroy these nations before you, so that you shall dispossess them, and Joshua will go over at your head, <f>ⓔ</f>as the LORD has spoken.
Deuteronomy 31-4 And the LORD will do to them <f>ⓕ</f>as he did to Sihon <f>ⓖ</f>and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when he destroyed them.
Deuteronomy 31-5 And the LORD will give them over to you, and you shall do to them <f>ⓗ</f>according to the whole commandment that I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy 31-6 <f>ⓘ</f> Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, <f>ⓙ</f>for it is the LORD your God who goes with you. <f>ⓚ</f>He will not leave you or forsake you.”
Deuteronomy 31-7 <pb/>Then <f>ⓛ</f>Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, <f>ⓜ</f>“Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land that the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall put them in possession of it.
Deuteronomy 31-8 It is the LORD <f>ⓝ</f>who goes before you. He will be with you; <f>ⓞ</f>he will not leave you or forsake you. <f>ⓟ</f>Do not fear or be dismayed.”
Deuteronomy 31-9 <pb/>Then Moses <f>ⓠ</f>wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, <f>ⓡ</f>who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31-10 And Moses commanded them, <f>ⓢ</f>“At the end of every seven years, at the set time in the year of release, at <f>ⓣ</f>the Feast of Booths,
Deuteronomy 31-11 when all Israel comes <f>ⓤ</f>to appear before the LORD your God at the place that he will choose, <f>ⓥ</f>you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
Deuteronomy 31-12 <f>ⓦ</f> Assemble the people, men, women, and little ones, and the sojourner within your towns, that they may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, and be careful to do all the words of this law,
Deuteronomy 31-13 and that their children, <f>ⓧ</f>who have not known it, <f>ⓨ</f>may hear and learn to fear the LORD your God, <f>ⓩ</f>as long as you live in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess.”
Deuteronomy 31-14 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓐ</f>“Behold, the days approach when you must die. Call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that <f>ⓑ</f>I may commission him.” And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
Deuteronomy 31-15 And <f>ⓒ</f>the LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud. And the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance of the tent.
Deuteronomy 31-16 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓓ</f>“Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers. Then this people will rise and <f>ⓔ</f>whore after the foreign gods among them in the land that they are entering, and they will <f>ⓕ</f>forsake me and <f>ⓖ</f>break my covenant that I have made with them.
Deuteronomy 31-17 Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and <f>ⓗ</f>I will forsake them and <f>ⓘ</f>hide my face from them, and they will be devoured. And many evils and troubles will come upon them, so that they will say in that day, <f>ⓙ</f>‘Have not these evils come upon us because <f>ⓚ</f>our God is not among us?’
Deuteronomy 31-18 And I will surely hide my face in that day because of all the evil that they have done, because <f>ⓛ</f>they have turned to other gods.
Deuteronomy 31-19 <pb/>“Now therefore write <f>ⓜ</f>this song and <f>ⓝ</f>teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be <f>ⓞ</f>a witness for me against the people of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31-20 For when I have brought them into the land <f>ⓟ</f>flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to give to their fathers, and they have eaten and are full and <f>ⓠ</f>grown fat, <f>ⓡ</f>they will turn to other gods and serve them, and <f>ⓢ</f>despise me and <f>ⓣ</f>break my covenant.
Deuteronomy 31-21 And when many evils and troubles have come upon them, this song shall confront them as <f>ⓤ</f>a witness (for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring). For <f>ⓥ</f>I know what they are inclined to do even today, before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give.”
Deuteronomy 31-22 So Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the people of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31-23 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> And the LORD <f>[1]</f> commissioned Joshua the son of Nun and said, <f>ⓧ</f>“Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the people of Israel into the land that I swore to give them. <f>ⓨ</f>I will be with you.”
Deuteronomy 31-24 <pb/>When Moses had finished <f>ⓩ</f>writing the words of this law in a book to the very end,
Deuteronomy 31-25 Moses commanded <f>ⓐ</f>the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
Deuteronomy 31-26 “Take this Book of the Law <f>ⓑ</f>and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for <f>ⓒ</f>a witness against you.
Deuteronomy 31-27 For I know how rebellious and <f>ⓓ</f>stubborn you are. Behold, even today while I am yet alive with you, <f>ⓔ</f>you have been rebellious against the LORD. How much more after my death!
Deuteronomy 31-28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, that I may speak <f>ⓕ</f>these words in their ears and <f>ⓖ</f>call heaven and earth to witness against them.
Deuteronomy 31-29 For I know that after my death <f>ⓗ</f>you will surely act corruptly and turn aside from the way that I have commanded you. And <f>ⓘ</f>in the days to come <f>ⓙ</f>evil will befall you, because you will do what is evil in the sight of the LORD, <f>ⓚ</f>provoking him to anger through the work of your hands.”
Deuteronomy 31-30 <pb/>Then Moses spoke the words of this song until they were finished, in the ears of all the assembly of Israel:
Psalm 71-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> In you, O LORD, do I take refuge; </t><t>let me never be put to shame!</t>
Psalm 71-2 <t>In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; </t><t>incline your ear to me, and save me!</t>
Psalm 71-3 <t>Be to me a rock of <f>ⓑ</f>refuge, </t><t>to which I may continually come; </t><t>you have <f>ⓒ</f>given the command to save me, </t><t>for you are my <f>ⓓ</f>rock and my fortress. </t>
Psalm 71-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, </t><t>from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man.</t>
Psalm 71-5 <t>For you, O Lord, are my <f>ⓕ</f>hope, </t><t>my trust, O LORD, from my youth.</t>
Psalm 71-6 <t>Upon you I have leaned <f>ⓖ</f>from before my birth; </t><t>you are he who <f>ⓗ</f>took me from my mother's womb. </t><t>My praise is continually of you. </t>
Psalm 71-7 <pb/><t>I have been as <f>ⓘ</f>a portent to many, </t><t>but you are my strong refuge.</t>
Psalm 71-8 <t>My <f>ⓙ</f>mouth is filled with your praise, </t><t>and with your glory all the day.</t>
Psalm 71-9 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Do not cast me off in the time of old age; </t><t>forsake me not when my strength is spent.</t>
Psalm 71-10 <t>For my enemies speak concerning me; </t><t>those who <f>ⓛ</f>watch for my life <f>ⓜ</f>consult together</t>
Psalm 71-11 <t>and say, “God has forsaken him; </t><t>pursue and seize him, </t><t>for there is none to deliver him.” </t>
Psalm 71-12 <pb/><t>O God, be not <f>ⓝ</f>far from me; </t><t>O my God, <f>ⓞ</f>make haste to help me!</t>
Psalm 71-13 <t>May my accusers be <f>ⓟ</f>put to shame and consumed; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>with scorn and disgrace may they be covered </t><t>who <f>ⓡ</f>seek my hurt.</t>
Psalm 71-14 <t>But I will <f>ⓢ</f>hope continually </t><t>and will <f>ⓣ</f>praise you yet more and more.</t>
Psalm 71-15 <t>My <f>ⓤ</f>mouth will tell of your righteous acts, </t><t>of your deeds of salvation all the day, </t><t>for <f>ⓥ</f>their number is past my knowledge.</t>
Psalm 71-16 <t>With the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD I will come; </t><t>I will remind them of your righteousness, yours alone. </t>
Psalm 71-17 <pb/><t>O God, from my youth you have taught me, </t><t>and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.</t>
Psalm 71-18 <t>So even to <f>ⓦ</f>old age and gray hairs, </t><t>O God, <f>ⓧ</f>do not forsake me, </t><t>until I proclaim your might to another generation, </t><t>your power to all those to come.</t>
Psalm 71-19 <t>Your <f>ⓨ</f>righteousness, O God, </t><t>reaches the high heavens. </t><t>You who have done <f>ⓩ</f>great things, </t><t>O God, <f>ⓐ</f>who is like you?</t>
Psalm 71-20 <t>You who have <f>ⓑ</f>made me see many troubles and calamities </t><t>will <f>ⓒ</f>revive me again; </t><t>from the depths of the earth </t><t>you will bring me up again.</t>
Psalm 71-21 <t>You will increase my greatness </t><t>and comfort me again. </t>
Psalm 71-22 <pb/><t>I will also praise you with <f>ⓓ</f>the harp </t><t>for your faithfulness, O my God; </t><t>I will sing praises to you with the lyre, </t><t>O <f>ⓔ</f>Holy One of Israel.</t>
Psalm 71-23 <t>My lips will shout for joy, </t><t>when I sing praises to you; </t><t>my soul also, which you have <f>ⓕ</f>redeemed.</t>
Psalm 71-24 <t>And my <f>ⓖ</f>tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, </t><t>for they have been <f>ⓗ</f>put to shame and disappointed </t><t>who sought to do me hurt. </t>
Zechariah 3-1 <pb/>Then he showed me <f>ⓐ</f>Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and <f>ⓑ</f>Satan <f>[1]</f> standing at his right hand to accuse him.
Zechariah 3-2 And the LORD said to Satan, <f>ⓒ</f>“The LORD rebuke you, O Satan! The LORD who has <f>ⓓ</f>chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this <f>ⓔ</f>a brand <f>[2]</f> plucked from the fire?”
Zechariah 3-3 Now <f>ⓕ</f>Joshua was standing before the angel, <f>ⓖ</f>clothed with filthy garments.
Zechariah 3-4 And the angel said to <f>ⓗ</f>those who were standing before him, <f>ⓘ</f>“Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him he said, “Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>I have taken your iniquity away from you, and <f>ⓚ</f>I will clothe you with pure vestments.”
Zechariah 3-5 And I said, <f>ⓛ</f>“Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD was standing by.
Zechariah 3-6 <pb/>And the angel of the LORD solemnly assured <f>ⓜ</f>Joshua,
Zechariah 3-7 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and <f>ⓝ</f>keep my charge, then you shall <f>ⓞ</f>rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among <f>ⓟ</f>those who are standing here.
Zechariah 3-8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for <f>ⓠ</f>they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring <f>ⓡ</f>my servant <f>ⓢ</f>the Branch.
Zechariah 3-9 For behold, on <f>ⓣ</f>the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with <f>ⓤ</f>seven eyes, <f>[3]</f> I will <f>ⓥ</f>engrave its inscription, declares the LORD of hosts, and <f>ⓦ</f>I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.
Zechariah 3-10 In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come <f>ⓧ</f>under his vine and under his fig tree.”
