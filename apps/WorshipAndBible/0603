9-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
9-2 and he said to Aaron, <f>ⓑ</f>“Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and <f>ⓒ</f>a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
9-3 And say to the people of Israel, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering,
9-4 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and <f>ⓔ</f>a grain offering mixed with oil, for <f>ⓕ</f>today the LORD will appear to you.’”
9-5 And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
9-6 And Moses said, “This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.”
9-7 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and <f>ⓖ</f>offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and <f>ⓗ</f>make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.”
9-8 <pb/>So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
9-9 <f>ⓘ</f> And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and <f>ⓙ</f>put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
9-10 <f>ⓚ</f> But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, <f>ⓛ</f>as the LORD commanded Moses.
9-11 <f>ⓜ</f> The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp.
9-12 <pb/>Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he <f>ⓝ</f>threw it against the sides of the altar.
9-13 <f>ⓞ</f> And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.
9-14 <f>ⓟ</f> And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
9-15 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then he presented the people's offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and <f>ⓡ</f>offered it as a sin offering, <f>ⓢ</f>like the first one.
9-16 And he presented the burnt offering and offered it <f>ⓣ</f>according to the <f>ⓤ</f>rule.
9-17 And he presented the <f>ⓥ</f>grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, <f>ⓦ</f>besides the burnt offering of the morning.
9-18 <pb/>Then he killed the ox and the ram, <f>ⓧ</f>the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.
9-19 But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers <f>ⓨ</f>the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver —
9-20 they put the fat pieces on the breasts, <f>ⓩ</f>and he burned the fat pieces on the altar,
9-21 but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved <f>ⓐ</f>for a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses commanded.
9-22 <pb/>Then Aaron <f>ⓑ</f>lifted up his hands toward the people and <f>ⓒ</f>blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
9-23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and <f>ⓓ</f>the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
9-24 And <f>ⓔ</f>fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, <f>ⓕ</f>they shouted and <f>ⓖ</f>fell on their faces.
