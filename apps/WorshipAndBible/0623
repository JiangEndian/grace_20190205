2-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
2-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “The people of Israel shall camp each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers' houses. They shall camp facing the tent of meeting on every side.
2-3 Those to camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah by their companies, the chief of the people of Judah being <f>ⓑ</f>Nahshon the son of Amminadab,
2-4 his company as listed being 74,600.
2-5 Those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, the chief of the people of Issachar being Nethanel the son of Zuar,

2-7 Then the tribe of Zebulun, the chief of the people of Zebulun being Eliab the son of Helon,
2-8 his company as listed being 57,400.
2-9 All those listed of the camp of Judah, by their companies, were 186,400. <f>ⓒ</f>They shall set out first on the march.
2-10 <pb/>“On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben by their companies, the chief of the people of Reuben being Elizur the son of Shedeur,
2-11 his company as listed being 46,500.
2-12 And those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, the chief of the people of Simeon being Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai,
2-13 his company as listed being 59,300.
2-14 Then the tribe of Gad, the chief of the people of Gad being Eliasaph the son of <f>ⓓ</f>Reuel,
2-15 his company as listed being 45,650.
2-16 All those listed of the camp of Reuben, by their companies, were 151,450. <f>ⓔ</f>They shall set out second.
2-17 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> “Then the tent of meeting shall set out, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; as they camp, so shall they set out, each in position, standard by standard.
2-18 <pb/>“On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their companies, the chief of the people of Ephraim being Elishama the son of Ammihud,
2-19 his company as listed being 40,500.
2-20 And next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, the chief of the people of Manasseh being Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur,
2-21 his company as listed being 32,200.
2-22 Then the tribe of Benjamin, the chief of the people of Benjamin being Abidan the son of Gideoni,
2-23 his company as listed being 35,400.
2-24 All those listed of the camp of Ephraim, by their companies, were 108,100. <f>ⓖ</f>They shall set out third on the march.
2-25 <pb/>“On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan by their companies, the chief of the people of Dan being Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai,
2-26 his company as listed being 62,700.
2-27 And those to camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, the chief of the people of Asher being Pagiel the son of Ochran,
2-28 his company as listed being 41,500.
2-29 Then the tribe of Naphtali, the chief of the people of Naphtali being Ahira the son of Enan,
2-30 his company as listed being 53,400.
2-31 All those listed of the camp of Dan were 157,600. <f>ⓗ</f>They shall set out last, standard by standard.”
2-32 <pb/>These are the people of Israel as listed by their fathers' houses. All those listed in the camps by their companies were <f>ⓘ</f>603,550.
2-33 But <f>ⓙ</f>the Levites were not listed among the people of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses.
2-34 <pb/>Thus did the people of Israel. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, <f>ⓚ</f>so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, each one in his clan, according to his fathers' house.
6-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f> <pb/><t>O LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>rebuke me not in your anger, </t><t>nor <f>ⓒ</f>discipline me in your wrath.</t>
6-2 <t>Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>heal me, O LORD, <f>ⓔ</f>for my bones are troubled.</t>
6-3 <t>My <f>ⓕ</f>soul also is greatly troubled. </t><t>But you, O LORD — <f>ⓖ</f>how long? </t>
6-4 <pb/><t>Turn, O LORD, deliver my life; </t><t>save me for the sake of your steadfast love.</t>
6-5 <t>For in <f>ⓗ</f>death there is no remembrance of you; </t><t>in Sheol who will give you praise? </t>
6-6 <pb/><t>I am <f>ⓘ</f>weary with my <f>ⓙ</f>moaning; </t><t>every night I flood my bed with tears; </t><t>I drench my couch with my weeping.</t>
6-7 <t>My <f>ⓚ</f>eye wastes away because of grief; </t><t>it grows weak because of all my foes. </t>
6-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> Depart from me, all you <f>ⓜ</f>workers of evil, </t><t>for the LORD <f>ⓝ</f>has heard the sound of my weeping.</t>
6-9 <t>The LORD has heard my <f>ⓞ</f>plea; </t><t>the LORD accepts my prayer.</t>
6-10 <t>All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; </t><t>they shall <f>ⓟ</f>turn back and be put to shame in a moment. </t>
47-1 <pb/>Then he brought me back to <f>ⓐ</f>the door of the temple, and behold, <f>ⓑ</f>water was issuing from below <f>ⓒ</f>the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of <f>ⓓ</f>the altar.
47-2 Then he brought me out by way of <f>ⓔ</f>the north gate and led me around on the outside to <f>ⓕ</f>the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, the water was trickling out on the south side.
47-3 <pb/>Going on eastward with a measuring line in his hand, <f>ⓖ</f>the man measured a thousand cubits, <f>[1]</f> and then led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep.
47-4 Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water, and it was waist-deep.
47-5 Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
47-6 And he said to me, <f>ⓗ</f>“Son of man, <f>ⓘ</f>have you seen this?” <pb/>Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
47-7 As I went back, I saw on the bank of the river <f>ⓙ</f>very many trees on the one side and on the other.
47-8 And he said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into <f>ⓚ</f>the Arabah, and enters the sea; <f>[2]</f> when the water flows into <f>ⓛ</f>the sea, the water will become fresh. <f>[3]</f>
47-9 And wherever the river goes, <f>[4]</f> every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish. For this water goes there, that the waters of the sea <f>[5]</f> may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.
47-10 Fishermen will stand beside the sea. From <f>ⓜ</f>Engedi to <f>ⓝ</f>Eneglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of <f>ⓞ</f>the Great Sea. <f>[6]</f>
47-11 But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt.
47-12 And on the banks, <f>ⓟ</f>on both sides of the river, there will grow <f>ⓠ</f>all kinds of trees for food. <f>ⓡ</f>Their leaves will not wither, nor their fruit fail, <f>ⓢ</f>but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and <f>ⓣ</f>their leaves for healing.”
47-13 <pb/>Thus says the Lord GOD: “This is the boundary <f>[7]</f> by which <f>ⓤ</f>you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. <f>ⓥ</f>Joseph shall have two portions.
47-14 And you shall divide equally what <f>ⓦ</f>I swore <f>ⓧ</f>to give to your fathers. <f>ⓨ</f>This land shall fall to you as your inheritance.
47-15 <pb/>“This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from <f>ⓩ</f>the Great Sea <f>ⓐ</f>by way of Hethlon to Lebo-hamath, and on to <f>ⓑ</f>Zedad, <f>[8]</f>
47-16 <f>ⓒ</f> Berothah, Sibraim (which lies on the border between <f>ⓓ</f>Damascus and <f>ⓔ</f>Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
47-17 So the boundary shall run from the sea to <f>ⓕ</f>Hazar-enan, which is on the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. <f>[9]</f> This shall be the north side. <f>[10]</f>
47-18 <pb/>“On the east side, the boundary shall run between Hauran and Damascus; along the Jordan between <f>ⓖ</f>Gilead and the land of Israel; to <f>ⓗ</f>the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. <f>[11]</f> This shall be the east side.
47-19 <pb/>“On the south side, it shall run from <f>ⓘ</f>Tamar as far as <f>ⓙ</f>the waters of Meribah-kadesh, from there along <f>ⓚ</f>the Brook of Egypt <f>[12]</f> to <f>ⓛ</f>the Great Sea. This shall be the south side.
47-20 <pb/>“On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point <f>ⓜ</f>opposite Lebo-hamath. This shall be the west side.
47-21 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> “So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.
47-22 <f>ⓞ</f> You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and <f>ⓟ</f>for the sojourners who reside among you and have had children among you. <f>ⓠ</f>They shall be to you as native-born children of Israel. With you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
47-23 In whatever tribe the sojourner resides, there you shall assign him his inheritance, declares the Lord GOD.
