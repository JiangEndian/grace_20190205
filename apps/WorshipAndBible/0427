Exodus 12-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
Exodus 12-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “This month shall be for you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year for you.
Exodus 12-3 Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb <f>ⓑ</f>according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household.
Exodus 12-4 And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
Exodus 12-5 Your lamb shall be <f>ⓒ</f>without blemish, a male a year old. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats,
Exodus 12-6 and you shall keep it until the <f>ⓓ</f>fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs at twilight. <f>[1]</f>
Exodus 12-7 <pb/>“Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the <f>ⓔ</f>two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
Exodus 12-8 They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with <f>ⓕ</f>unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it.
Exodus 12-9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but <f>ⓖ</f>roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts.
Exodus 12-10 And <f>ⓗ</f>you shall let none of it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the morning you shall burn.
Exodus 12-11 In this manner you shall eat it: with <f>ⓘ</f>your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. <f>ⓙ</f>It is the LORD's Passover.
Exodus 12-12 For <f>ⓚ</f>I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on <f>ⓛ</f>all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: <f>ⓜ</f>I am the LORD.
Exodus 12-13 <f>ⓝ</f> The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.
Exodus 12-14 <pb/>“This day shall be <f>ⓞ</f>for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations, as a <f>ⓟ</f>statute forever, you shall keep it as a feast.
Exodus 12-15 <f>ⓠ</f> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses, for if anyone eats what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, <f>ⓡ</f>that person shall be cut off from Israel.
Exodus 12-16 On the first day you shall hold a <f>ⓢ</f>holy assembly, and on the seventh day a holy assembly. No work shall be done on those days. But what everyone needs to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.
Exodus 12-17 And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for <f>ⓣ</f>on this very day I brought your <f>ⓤ</f>hosts out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day, throughout your generations, as a statute forever.
Exodus 12-18 <f>ⓥ</f> In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
Exodus 12-19 <f>ⓦ</f> For seven days no leaven is to be found in your houses. If anyone eats what is leavened, <f>ⓧ</f>that person will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, <f>ⓨ</f>whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land.
Exodus 12-20 You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread.”
Exodus 12-21 <pb/>Then Moses called all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and select lambs for yourselves <f>ⓩ</f>according to your clans, and kill the Passover lamb.
Exodus 12-22 Take a bunch of <f>ⓐ</f>hyssop and <f>ⓑ</f>dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch <f>ⓒ</f>the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. <f>ⓓ</f>None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
Exodus 12-23 <f>ⓔ</f> For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood on <f>ⓕ</f>the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and <f>ⓖ</f>will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you.
Exodus 12-24 You shall observe this rite as a statute for you and for your sons forever.
Exodus 12-25 And when you come to the land that the LORD will give you, <f>ⓗ</f>as he has promised, you shall keep this service.
Exodus 12-26 And <f>ⓘ</f>when your children say to you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’
Exodus 12-27 you shall say, <f>ⓙ</f>‘It is the sacrifice of the LORD's Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.’” And the people <f>ⓚ</f>bowed their heads and worshiped.
Exodus 12-28 <pb/>Then the people of Israel went and did so; as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
Exodus 12-29 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> At midnight the <f>ⓜ</f>LORD struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, <f>ⓝ</f>from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock.
Exodus 12-30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians. And there was <f>ⓞ</f>a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where someone was not dead.
Exodus 12-31 Then he summoned Moses and Aaron by night and said, “Up, go out from among my people, <f>ⓟ</f>both you and the people of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as you have said.
Exodus 12-32 <f>ⓠ</f> Take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone, and bless me also!”
Exodus 12-33 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> The Egyptians were urgent with the people to send them out of the land in haste. For they said, “We shall all be dead.”
Exodus 12-34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders.
Exodus 12-35 The people of Israel had also done as Moses told them, for they had <f>ⓢ</f>asked the Egyptians for silver and gold jewelry and for clothing.
Exodus 12-36 <f>ⓣ</f> And the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that <f>ⓤ</f>they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.
Exodus 12-37 <pb/>And the <f>ⓥ</f>people of Israel journeyed from <f>ⓦ</f>Rameses to Succoth, <f>ⓧ</f>about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
Exodus 12-38 A <f>ⓨ</f>mixed multitude also went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds.
Exodus 12-39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had brought out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, because <f>ⓩ</f>they were thrust out of Egypt and <f>ⓐ</f>could not wait, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.
Exodus 12-40 <pb/>The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years.
Exodus 12-41 At the end of <f>ⓑ</f>430 years, on that very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
Exodus 12-42 It was a night of watching by the LORD, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; so this same night is a <f>ⓒ</f>night of watching kept to the LORD by all the people of Israel throughout their generations.
Exodus 12-43 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat of it,
Exodus 12-44 but every slave <f>[2]</f> that is <f>ⓓ</f>bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him.
Exodus 12-45 <f>ⓔ</f> No foreigner or hired worker may eat of it.
Exodus 12-46 It shall be eaten in one house; you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house, and <f>ⓕ</f>you shall not break any of its bones.
Exodus 12-47 <f>ⓖ</f> All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
Exodus 12-48 <f>ⓗ</f> If a stranger shall sojourn with you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised. Then he may come near and keep it; he <f>ⓘ</f>shall be as a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
Exodus 12-49 There shall be <f>ⓙ</f>one law for the native and for the <f>ⓚ</f>stranger who sojourns among you.”
Exodus 12-50 <pb/>All the people of Israel did just as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus 12-51 And on that very day the <f>ⓛ</f>LORD brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their <f>ⓜ</f>hosts.
Esther 1-1 <pb/>Now in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned <f>ⓐ</f>from India to Ethiopia over <f>ⓑ</f>127 provinces,
Esther 1-2 in those days when King Ahasuerus <f>ⓒ</f>sat on his royal throne in <f>ⓓ</f>Susa, the citadel,
Esther 1-3 in the third year of his reign <f>ⓔ</f>he gave a feast for all his officials and servants. The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him,
Esther 1-4 while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness for many days, 180 days.
Esther 1-5 And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa the citadel, both great and small, a feast lasting for seven days in the court of <f>ⓕ</f>the garden of the king's palace.
Esther 1-6 There were white cotton curtains and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rods <f>[1]</f> and marble pillars, and also <f>ⓖ</f>couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones.
Esther 1-7 Drinks were served in golden vessels, vessels of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king.
Esther 1-8 And drinking was according to this edict: “There is no compulsion.” For the king had given orders to all the staff of his palace to do as each man desired.
Esther 1-9 Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the palace that belonged to King Ahasuerus.
Esther 1-10 <pb/>On the seventh day, <f>ⓗ</f>when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, <f>ⓘ</f>Harbona, <f>ⓙ</f>Bigtha and Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,
Esther 1-11 to bring Queen Vashti before the king with <f>ⓚ</f>her royal crown, <f>[2]</f> in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty, for she was lovely to look at.
Esther 1-12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command delivered by the eunuchs. At this the king became enraged, and his anger burned within him.
Esther 1-13 <pb/>Then the king said to <f>ⓛ</f>the wise men <f>ⓜ</f>who knew the times (for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment,
Esther 1-14 the men next to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and <f>ⓝ</f>Memucan, <f>ⓞ</f>the seven princes of Persia and Media, <f>ⓟ</f>who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom):
Esther 1-15 “According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?”
Esther 1-16 Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the officials, “Not only against the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also against all the officials and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
Esther 1-17 For the queen's behavior will be made known to all women, causing them to look at their husbands with contempt, <f>[3]</f> since they will say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.’
Esther 1-18 This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will say the same to all the king's officials, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty.
Esther 1-19 If it please the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so <f>ⓠ</f>that it may not be repealed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus. And let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.
Esther 1-20 So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, for it is vast, <f>ⓡ</f>all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike.”
Esther 1-21 This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed.
Esther 1-22 He sent letters to all the royal provinces, <f>ⓢ</f>to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, that every man be master in his own household and speak according to the language of his people.
Jeremiah 47-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet <f>ⓐ</f>concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck down <f>ⓑ</f>Gaza.
Jeremiah 47-2 <pb/><t>“Thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>Behold, waters are rising <f>ⓓ</f>out of the north, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>and shall become an overflowing torrent; </t><t>they shall overflow <f>ⓕ</f>the land and all that fills it, </t><t>the city and those who dwell in it. </t><t>Men shall cry out, </t><t>and every inhabitant of the land shall wail.</t>
Jeremiah 47-3 <t>At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of their wheels, </t><t>the fathers <f>ⓗ</f>look not back to their children, </t><t>so feeble are their hands,</t>
Jeremiah 47-4 <t>because of the day that is coming to destroy </t><t>all <f>ⓘ</f>the Philistines, </t><t>to cut off from <f>ⓙ</f>Tyre and Sidon </t><t>every helper that remains. </t><t>For the LORD is destroying the Philistines, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>the remnant of the coastland of <f>ⓛ</f>Caphtor.</t>
Jeremiah 47-5 <t><f>ⓜ</f> Baldness has come upon Gaza; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>Ashkelon has perished. </t><t>O remnant of their valley, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>how long will you gash yourselves?</t>
Jeremiah 47-6 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Ah, sword of the LORD! </t><t>How long till you are quiet? </t><t>Put yourself into your scabbard; </t><t>rest and be still!</t>
Jeremiah 47-7 <t>How can it <f>[1]</f> be quiet </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>when the LORD has given it a charge? </t><t>Against <f>ⓡ</f>Ashkelon and against the seashore </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>he has appointed it.” </t>
2 Peter 2-1 <pb/>But <f>ⓐ</f>false prophets also arose among the people, <f>ⓑ</f>just as there will be false teachers among you, who will <f>ⓒ</f>secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master <f>ⓓ</f>who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
2 Peter 2-2 And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth <f>ⓔ</f>will be blasphemed.
2 Peter 2-3 And <f>ⓕ</f>in their greed they will exploit you <f>ⓖ</f>with false words. <f>ⓗ</f>Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
2 Peter 2-4 <pb/>For if God did not spare <f>ⓘ</f>angels when they sinned, but <f>ⓙ</f>cast them into hell <f>[1]</f> and committed them to chains <f>[2]</f> of gloomy darkness <f>ⓚ</f>to be kept until the judgment;
2 Peter 2-5 if he did not spare the ancient world, but <f>ⓛ</f>preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought <f>ⓜ</f>a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
2 Peter 2-6 if by <f>ⓝ</f>turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction, <f>ⓞ</f>making them an example of <f>ⓟ</f>what is going to happen to the ungodly; <f>[3]</f>
2 Peter 2-7 and <f>ⓠ</f>if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked
2 Peter 2-8 (for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, <f>ⓡ</f>he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard);
2 Peter 2-9 then <f>ⓢ</f>the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, <f>[4]</f> and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,
2 Peter 2-10 and especially <f>ⓣ</f>those who indulge <f>[5]</f> in the lust of defiling passion and <f>ⓤ</f>despise authority. <pb/>Bold and willful, they do not tremble <f>ⓥ</f>as they blaspheme the glorious ones,
2 Peter 2-11 <f>ⓦ</f> whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord.
2 Peter 2-12 <f>ⓧ</f> But these, like irrational animals, <f>ⓨ</f>creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction,
2 Peter 2-13 suffering wrong as <f>ⓩ</f>the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure <f>ⓐ</f>to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, <f>[6]</f> while <f>ⓑ</f>they feast with you.
2 Peter 2-14 They have eyes full of adultery, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts <f>ⓓ</f>trained in greed. <f>ⓔ</f>Accursed children!
2 Peter 2-15 Forsaking the right way, <f>ⓕ</f>they have gone astray. They have followed <f>ⓖ</f>the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved <f>ⓗ</f>gain from wrongdoing,
2 Peter 2-16 but was rebuked for his own transgression; <f>ⓘ</f>a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
2 Peter 2-17 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm. <f>ⓚ</f>For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved.
2 Peter 2-18 For, <f>ⓛ</f>speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely <f>ⓜ</f>escaping from those who live in error.
2 Peter 2-19 They promise them <f>ⓝ</f>freedom, <f>ⓞ</f>but they themselves are slaves <f>[8]</f> of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.
2 Peter 2-20 For if, <f>ⓟ</f>after they have escaped the defilements of the world <f>ⓠ</f>through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, <f>ⓡ</f>the last state has become worse for them than the first.
2 Peter 2-21 For <f>ⓢ</f>it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from <f>ⓣ</f>the holy commandment delivered to them.
2 Peter 2-22 What the true proverb says has happened to them: “The <f>ⓤ</f>dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire.”
