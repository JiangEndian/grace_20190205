12-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>the LORD said <f>[1]</f> to Abram, “Go from your country <f>[2]</f> and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
12-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
12-3 <f>ⓒ</f> I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and <f>ⓓ</f>in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” <f>[3]</f>
12-4 <pb/>So Abram went, as the LORD had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from <f>ⓔ</f>Haran.
12-5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan,
12-6 Abram <f>ⓕ</f>passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to <f>ⓖ</f>the oak <f>[4]</f> of <f>ⓗ</f>Moreh. At that time <f>ⓘ</f>the Canaanites were in the land.
12-7 Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, <f>ⓙ</f>“To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
12-8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of <f>ⓚ</f>Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the LORD and called upon the name of the LORD.
12-9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.
12-10 <pb/>Now <f>ⓛ</f>there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.
12-11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance,
12-12 and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they <f>ⓜ</f>will kill me, but they will let you live.
12-13 Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.”
12-14 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful.
12-15 And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
12-16 And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
12-17 <pb/>But the LORD <f>ⓝ</f>afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
12-18 So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
12-19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.”
12-20 And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.
10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
10-2 And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, <f>ⓑ</f>where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
10-3 And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
10-4 <f>ⓒ</f> “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.”
10-5 He said to them, “Come to me again in three days.” So the people went away.
10-6 <pb/>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, <f>[1]</f> who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?”
10-7 And they said to him, <f>ⓓ</f>“If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”
10-8 But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.
10-9 And he said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us’?”
10-10 And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us’; thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.
10-11 And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”
10-12 <pb/>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, “Come to me again the third day.”
10-13 And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men,
10-14 King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”
10-15 So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the LORD might fulfill his word, <f>ⓔ</f>which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
10-16 <pb/>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, “What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. <f>ⓕ</f>Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.” So all Israel went to their tents.
10-17 But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.
10-18 Then King Rehoboam sent <f>ⓖ</f>Hadoram, <f>[2]</f> who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
10-19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
63-1 <pb/><t>Who is this who comes from <f>ⓐ</f>Edom, </t><t>in crimsoned garments from <f>ⓑ</f>Bozrah, </t><t>he who is splendid in his apparel, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>marching in the greatness of his strength? </t><t>“It is I, speaking in righteousness, </t><t>mighty to save.” </t>
63-2 <pb/><t>Why is your <f>ⓓ</f>apparel red, </t><t>and your garments like his <f>ⓔ</f>who treads in the winepress? </t>
63-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> “I have trodden the winepress alone, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>and from the peoples no one was with me; </t><t>I trod them in my anger </t><t>and trampled them in my wrath; </t><t>their lifeblood <f>[1]</f> spattered on my garments, </t><t>and stained all my apparel.</t>
63-4 <t><f>ⓗ</f> For the day of vengeance was in my heart, </t><t>and my year of redemption <f>[2]</f> had come.</t>
63-5 <t>I looked, but <f>ⓘ</f>there was no one to help; </t><t>I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold; </t><t>so my own arm brought me salvation, </t><t>and my wrath upheld me.</t>
63-6 <t>I trampled down the peoples in my anger; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>I made them drunk in my wrath, </t><t>and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.” </t>
63-7 <pb/><t>I will recount the steadfast love of the LORD, </t><t>the praises of the LORD, </t><t>according to all that the LORD has granted us, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>and the great goodness to the house of Israel </t><t>that he has granted them according to his compassion, </t><t>according to the abundance of his steadfast love.</t>
63-8 <t>For he said, “Surely they are my people, </t><t>children who will not deal falsely.” </t><t>And he became their Savior.</t>
63-9 <t><f>ⓛ</f> In all their affliction he was afflicted, <f>[3]</f> </t><t>and the angel of his presence saved them; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old. </t>
63-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> But they rebelled </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>and grieved his Holy Spirit; </t><t>therefore he turned to be their enemy, </t><t>and himself fought against them.</t>
63-11 <t>Then he remembered <f>ⓠ</f>the days of old, </t><t>of Moses and his people. <f>[4]</f> </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>Where is he who brought them up out of the sea </t><t>with the shepherds of his flock? </t><t>Where is he who put in the midst of them </t><t>his Holy Spirit,</t>
63-12 <t>who caused his glorious arm </t><t>to go at the right hand of Moses, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>who divided the waters before them </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>to make for himself an everlasting name,</t>
63-13 <t>who led them through the depths? </t><t>Like a horse in the desert, </t><t>they did not stumble.</t>
63-14 <t>Like livestock that go down into the valley, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. </t><t>So you led your people, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>to make for yourself a glorious name. </t>
63-15 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> Look down from heaven and see, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>from your holy and beautiful <f>[5]</f> habitation. </t><t>Where are <f>ⓨ</f>your zeal and your might? </t><t>The stirring of your inner parts and your compassion </t><t>are held back from me.</t>
63-16 <t>For <f>ⓩ</f>you are our Father, </t><t>though Abraham does not know us, </t><t>and Israel does not acknowledge us; </t><t>you, O LORD, are our Father, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>our Redeemer from of old is your name.</t>
63-17 <t>O LORD, why do you make us wander from your ways </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>harden our heart, so that we fear you not? </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>Return for the sake of your servants, </t><t>the tribes of your heritage.</t>
63-18 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Your holy people held possession for a little while; <f>[6]</f> </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>our adversaries have trampled down your sanctuary.</t>
63-19 <t><f>ⓕ</f> We have become like those over whom you have never ruled, </t><t>like those who are not called by your name. </t>
1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>an apostle of Christ Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>by the will of God, and Timothy <f>ⓒ</f>our brother,
1-2 <pb/>To the <f>ⓓ</f>saints and faithful brothers <f>[1]</f> in Christ at Colossae: <pb/><f>ⓔ</f>Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
1-4 since we heard of <f>ⓖ</f>your faith in Christ Jesus and of <f>ⓗ</f>the love that you have for all the saints,
1-5 because of <f>ⓘ</f>the hope <f>ⓙ</f>laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in <f>ⓚ</f>the word of the truth, the gospel,
1-6 which has come to you, as indeed <f>ⓛ</f>in the whole world it is <f>ⓜ</f>bearing fruit and increasing — as it also does among you, since the day you <f>ⓝ</f>heard it and understood <f>ⓞ</f>the grace of God in truth,
1-7 just as you learned it from <f>ⓟ</f>Epaphras our beloved <f>ⓠ</f>fellow servant. <f>[2]</f> He is <f>ⓡ</f>a faithful minister of Christ on your <f>[3]</f> behalf
1-8 and has made known to us your <f>ⓢ</f>love in the Spirit.
1-9 <pb/>And so, <f>ⓣ</f>from the day we heard, <f>ⓤ</f>we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that <f>ⓥ</f>you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all <f>ⓦ</f>spiritual wisdom and understanding,
1-10 so as <f>ⓧ</f>to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, <f>ⓨ</f>fully pleasing to him: <f>ⓩ</f>bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
1-11 <f>ⓐ</f> being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for <f>ⓑ</f>all endurance and patience <f>ⓒ</f>with joy;
1-12 <f>ⓓ</f> giving thanks <f>[4]</f> to the Father, who has qualified you <f>[5]</f> to share in <f>ⓔ</f>the inheritance of the saints in light.
1-13 He <f>ⓕ</f>has delivered us from <f>ⓖ</f>the domain of darkness and transferred us to <f>ⓗ</f>the kingdom of <f>ⓘ</f>his beloved Son,
1-14 <f>ⓙ</f> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
1-15 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> He is the image of <f>ⓛ</f>the invisible God, <f>ⓜ</f>the firstborn of all creation.
1-16 For by <f>[6]</f> him all things were created, <f>ⓝ</f>in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether <f>ⓞ</f>thrones or <f>ⓟ</f>dominions or rulers or authorities — all things were created <f>ⓠ</f>through him and for him.
1-17 And <f>ⓡ</f>he is before all things, and in him all things <f>ⓢ</f>hold together.
1-18 And <f>ⓣ</f>he is the head of the body, the church. He is <f>ⓤ</f>the beginning, <f>ⓥ</f>the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.
1-19 For <f>ⓦ</f>in him all the <f>ⓧ</f>fullness of God was pleased to dwell,
1-20 and <f>ⓨ</f>through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, <f>ⓩ</f>making peace <f>ⓐ</f>by the blood of his cross.
1-21 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, <f>ⓒ</f>doing evil deeds,
1-22 he has now reconciled <f>ⓓ</f>in his body of flesh by his death, <f>ⓔ</f>in order to present you holy and blameless and <f>ⓕ</f>above reproach before him,
1-23 <f>ⓖ</f> if indeed you continue in the faith, <f>ⓗ</f>stable and steadfast, not shifting from <f>ⓘ</f>the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed <f>ⓙ</f>in all creation <f>[7]</f> under heaven, <f>ⓚ</f>and of which I, Paul, became a minister.
1-24 <pb/>Now <f>ⓛ</f>I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh <f>ⓜ</f>I am filling up <f>ⓝ</f>what is lacking in Christ's afflictions <f>ⓞ</f>for the sake of his body, that is, the church,
1-25 <f>ⓟ</f> of which I became a minister according to <f>ⓠ</f>the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,
1-26 <f>ⓡ</f> the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints.
1-27 <f>ⓢ</f> To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are <f>ⓣ</f>the riches of the glory of <f>ⓤ</f>this mystery, which is Christ in you, <f>ⓥ</f>the hope of glory.
1-28 Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that <f>ⓦ</f>we may present everyone <f>ⓧ</f>mature in Christ.
1-29 For this <f>ⓨ</f>I toil, <f>ⓩ</f>struggling <f>ⓐ</f>with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.
