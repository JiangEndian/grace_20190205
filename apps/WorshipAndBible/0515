Exodus 30-11 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses,
Exodus 30-12 <f>ⓛ</f> “When you take the census of the people of Israel, then each shall give <f>ⓜ</f>a ransom for his life to the LORD when you number them, that there be no plague among them when you number them.
Exodus 30-13 Each one who is numbered in the census shall give this: half a shekel <f>[2]</f> according to the <f>ⓝ</f>shekel of the sanctuary (the <f>ⓞ</f>shekel is twenty gerahs), <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>half a shekel as an offering to the LORD.

Exodus 30-17 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses,
Exodus 30-18 “You shall also make a <f>ⓣ</f>basin of bronze, with its stand of bronze, for washing. <f>ⓤ</f>You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it,

Exodus 30-23 “Take the <f>ⓧ</f>finest spices: of liquid myrrh 500 shekels, and of sweet-smelling cinnamon half as much, that is, 250, and 250 of <f>ⓨ</f>aromatic cane,
Exodus 30-24 and 500 of cassia, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a <f>ⓩ</f>hin <f>[5]</f> of olive oil.
Exodus 30-25 And you shall make of these a sacred anointing oil blended as by the <f>ⓐ</f>perfumer; it shall be a <f>ⓑ</f>holy anointing oil.
Exodus 30-26 <f>ⓒ</f> With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony,
Exodus 30-27 and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
Exodus 30-28 and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils and the <f>ⓓ</f>basin and its stand.
Exodus 30-29 You shall consecrate them, that they may be most holy. <f>ⓔ</f>Whatever touches them will become holy.

Job 9-1 <pb/>Then Job answered and said:

Job 9-3 <t>If one wished to <f>ⓑ</f>contend with him, </t><t>one could not answer him once in a thousand times.</t>

Job 9-16 <t>If I summoned him and he answered me, </t><t>I would not believe that he was listening to my voice.</t>
Job 9-17 <t>For he crushes me with a tempest </t><t>and multiplies my wounds <f>ⓤ</f>without cause;</t>
Job 9-18 <t>he will not let me get my breath, </t><t>but fills me with bitterness.</t>

Job 9-20 <t>Though I am in the right, <f>ⓧ</f>my own mouth would condemn me; </t><t>though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse.</t>

Ezekiel 8-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, <f>ⓑ</f>as I sat in my house, with <f>ⓒ</f>the elders of Judah sitting before me, <f>ⓓ</f>the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there.
Ezekiel 8-2 Then I looked, and behold, <f>ⓔ</f>a form that had the appearance of a man. <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like <f>ⓖ</f>gleaming metal. <f>[2]</f>
Ezekiel 8-3 He <f>ⓗ</f>put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up <f>ⓘ</f>between earth and heaven and <f>ⓙ</f>brought me in <f>ⓚ</f>visions of God to Jerusalem, <f>ⓛ</f>to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, <f>ⓜ</f>where was the seat of the <f>ⓝ</f>image of jealousy, <f>ⓞ</f>which provokes to jealousy.
Ezekiel 8-4 And behold, <f>ⓟ</f>the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw <f>ⓠ</f>in the valley.
Ezekiel 8-5 <pb/>Then he said to me, <f>ⓡ</f>“Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of <f>ⓢ</f>the altar gate, in the entrance, was this <f>ⓣ</f>image of jealousy.
Ezekiel 8-6 And he said to me, “Son of man, <f>ⓤ</f>do you see what they are doing, <f>ⓥ</f>the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, <f>ⓦ</f>to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.”
Ezekiel 8-7 <pb/>And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.
Ezekiel 8-8 Then he said to me, “Son of man, <f>ⓧ</f>dig in the wall.” So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance.
Ezekiel 8-9 And he said to me, “Go in, and see <f>ⓨ</f>the vile abominations that they are committing here.”
Ezekiel 8-10 So I went in and saw. And there, <f>ⓩ</f>engraved on the wall all around, was <f>ⓐ</f>every form of <f>ⓑ</f>creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel 8-11 And before them stood <f>ⓒ</f>seventy men of <f>ⓓ</f>the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of <f>ⓔ</f>Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and <f>ⓕ</f>the smoke of the cloud of incense went up.
Ezekiel 8-12 Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing <f>ⓖ</f>in the dark, each <f>ⓗ</f>in his room of pictures? For they say, <f>ⓘ</f>‘The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.’”
Ezekiel 8-13 He said also to me, <f>ⓙ</f>“You will see still greater abominations that they commit.”
Ezekiel 8-14 <pb/>Then he brought me to <f>ⓚ</f>the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
Ezekiel 8-15 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O <f>ⓛ</f>son of man? <f>ⓜ</f>You will see still greater abominations than these.”
Ezekiel 8-16 <pb/>And he brought me into <f>ⓝ</f>the inner court of the house of the LORD. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, <f>ⓞ</f>between the <f>ⓟ</f>porch and <f>ⓠ</f>the altar, were about twenty-five men, <f>ⓡ</f>with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping <f>ⓢ</f>the sun toward the east.
Ezekiel 8-17 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O <f>ⓣ</f>son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit <f>ⓤ</f>the abominations that they commit here, that <f>ⓥ</f>they should fill the land with violence and <f>ⓦ</f>provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their <f>[3]</f> nose.
Ezekiel 8-18 Therefore <f>ⓧ</f>I will act in wrath. <f>ⓨ</f>My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. <f>ⓩ</f>And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”
Revelation 9-1 <pb/>And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and <f>ⓐ</f>I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given <f>ⓑ</f>the key to the shaft of <f>ⓒ</f>the bottomless pit. <f>[1]</f>
Revelation 9-2 He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft <f>ⓓ</f>rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and <f>ⓔ</f>the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.
Revelation 9-3 Then from the smoke came <f>ⓕ</f>locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth.
Revelation 9-4 They were told <f>ⓖ</f>not to harm <f>ⓗ</f>the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have <f>ⓘ</f>the seal of God on their foreheads.
Revelation 9-5 They were allowed to torment them <f>ⓙ</f>for five months, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone.
Revelation 9-6 And in those days <f>ⓚ</f>people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them.
Revelation 9-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: <f>ⓜ</f>on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were <f>ⓝ</f>like human faces,
Revelation 9-8 their hair like women's hair, and <f>ⓞ</f>their teeth like lions' teeth;
Revelation 9-9 they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was <f>ⓟ</f>like the noise of many chariots with <f>ⓠ</f>horses rushing into battle.
Revelation 9-10 They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people <f>ⓡ</f>for five months is in their tails.
Revelation 9-11 They have <f>ⓢ</f>as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is <f>ⓣ</f>Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon. <f>[2]</f>
Revelation 9-12 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come.
Revelation 9-13 <pb/>Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from <f>ⓥ</f>the four horns of the golden altar before God,
Revelation 9-14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release <f>ⓦ</f>the four angels who are bound at <f>ⓧ</f>the great river Euphrates.”
Revelation 9-15 So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, were released <f>ⓨ</f>to kill a third of mankind.
Revelation 9-16 The number of <f>ⓩ</f>mounted troops was <f>ⓐ</f>twice ten thousand times ten thousand; <f>ⓑ</f>I heard their number.
Revelation 9-17 And this is how I saw the horses in my vision and those who rode them: they wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire <f>[3]</f> and of sulfur, and the heads of the horses were <f>ⓒ</f>like lions' heads, and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths.
Revelation 9-18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed, by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths.
Revelation 9-19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents with heads, and by means of them they wound.
Revelation 9-20 <pb/>The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, <f>ⓓ</f>did not repent of <f>ⓔ</f>the works of their hands nor give up worshiping <f>ⓕ</f>demons <f>ⓖ</f>and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk,
Revelation 9-21 nor did they repent of their murders or their <f>ⓗ</f>sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.
