2 Kings 11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when <f>ⓑ</f>Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family.
2 Kings 11-2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took <f>ⓒ</f>Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king's sons who were being put to death, and she put <f>[1]</f> him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus they <f>[2]</f> hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not put to death.
2 Kings 11-3 And he remained with her six years, hidden in the house of the LORD, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Kings 11-4 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> But in the seventh year <f>ⓔ</f>Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of <f>ⓕ</f>the Carites and of the guards, and had them come to him in the house of the LORD. And he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD, and he showed them the king's son.
2 Kings 11-5 And he commanded them, “This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, <f>ⓖ</f>those who come off duty on the Sabbath and guard the king's house
2 Kings 11-6 (<f>ⓗ</f>another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards) shall guard the palace. <f>[3]</f>
2 Kings 11-7 And the two divisions of you, which come on duty in force on the Sabbath and guard the house of the LORD on behalf of the king,
2 Kings 11-8 shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever approaches the ranks is to be put to death. Be with the king <f>ⓘ</f>when he goes out and when he comes in.”
2 Kings 11-9 <pb/>The captains did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they each brought his men who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
2 Kings 11-10 And the priest gave to the captains the spears and <f>ⓙ</f>shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of the LORD.
2 Kings 11-11 And the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house on behalf of the king.
2 Kings 11-12 Then he brought out the king's son and put <f>ⓚ</f>the crown on him and gave him <f>ⓛ</f>the testimony. And they proclaimed him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, <f>ⓜ</f>“Long live the king!”
2 Kings 11-13 <pb/>When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she went into the house of the LORD to the people.
2 Kings 11-14 And when she looked, there was the king standing <f>ⓝ</f>by the pillar, according to the custom, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and <f>ⓞ</f>blowing trumpets. And Athaliah <f>ⓟ</f>tore her clothes and cried, “Treason! Treason!”
2 Kings 11-15 Then Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains who were set over the army, “Bring her out between the ranks, and put to death with the sword anyone who follows her.” For the priest said, “Let her not be put to death in the house of the LORD.”
2 Kings 11-16 So they laid hands on her; and she went through the horses' entrance to the king's house, and there she was put to death.
2 Kings 11-17 <pb/>And Jehoiada <f>ⓠ</f>made a covenant between the LORD and the king and people, that they should be the LORD's people, and also <f>ⓡ</f>between the king and the people.
2 Kings 11-18 Then all the people of the land went to <f>ⓢ</f>the house of Baal and tore it down; <f>ⓣ</f>his altars and his images they broke in pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest posted watchmen over the house of the LORD.
2 Kings 11-19 And he took the captains, <f>ⓤ</f>the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching through <f>ⓥ</f>the gate of the guards to the king's house. And he took his seat on the throne of the kings.
2 Kings 11-20 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword at the king's house.
2 Kings 11-21 <pb/><f>[4]</f> <f>ⓦ</f>Jehoash <f>[5]</f> was seven years old when he began to reign.
Isaiah 10-1 <pb/><t>Woe to those who <f>ⓐ</f>decree iniquitous decrees, </t><t>and the writers who <f>ⓑ</f>keep writing oppression,</t>

Isaiah 10-3 <t>What will you do on <f>ⓓ</f>the day of punishment, </t><t>in the ruin that will come <f>ⓔ</f>from afar? </t><t>To whom will you flee for help, </t><t>and where will you leave your wealth?</t>
Isaiah 10-4 <t>Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners </t><t>or fall among the slain. </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>For all this his anger has not turned away, </t><t>and his hand is stretched out still. </t>
Isaiah 10-5 <pb/><t>Woe to Assyria, <f>ⓖ</f>the rod of my anger; </t><t>the staff in their hands is my fury!</t>
Isaiah 10-6 <t>Against a <f>ⓗ</f>godless nation I send him, </t><t>and against the people of my wrath I command him, </t><t>to take <f>ⓘ</f>spoil and seize plunder, </t><t>and to <f>ⓙ</f>tread them down like the mire of the streets.</t>
Isaiah 10-7 <t>But he <f>ⓚ</f>does not so intend, </t><t>and his heart does not so think; </t><t>but it is in his heart to destroy, </t><t>and to cut off nations not a few;</t>

Isaiah 10-10 <t>As my hand has reached to <f>ⓣ</f>the kingdoms of the idols, </t><t>whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,</t>
Isaiah 10-11 <t>shall I not do to Jerusalem and <f>ⓤ</f>her idols </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>as I have done to Samaria and her images?” </t>
Isaiah 10-12 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, <f>ⓧ</f>he <f>[1]</f> will punish the speech <f>[2]</f> of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes.
Isaiah 10-13 <f>ⓨ</f> For he says: <pb/><t>“By the strength of my hand I have done it, </t><t>and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; </t><t>I remove the boundaries of peoples, </t><t>and plunder their treasures; </t><t>like a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.</t>

Isaiah 10-16 <t>Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts </t><t>will send wasting sickness among his <f>ⓐ</f>stout warriors, </t><t>and under his glory <f>ⓑ</f>a burning will be kindled, </t><t>like the burning of fire.</t>
Isaiah 10-17 <t><f>ⓒ</f> The light of Israel will become a fire, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>his Holy One a flame, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>it will burn and devour </t><t>his thorns and briers <f>ⓕ</f>in one day.</t>
Isaiah 10-18 <t>The glory of <f>ⓖ</f>his forest and of his <f>ⓗ</f>fruitful land </t><t>the LORD will destroy, both soul and body, </t><t>and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.</t>

Isaiah 10-20 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> In that day <f>ⓙ</f>the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more <f>ⓚ</f>lean on him who struck them, but <f>ⓛ</f>will lean on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

Isaiah 10-22 <f>ⓝ</f> For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, <f>ⓞ</f>only a remnant of them will return. <f>ⓟ</f>Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.
Isaiah 10-23 For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.
Isaiah 10-24 <pb/>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: “O my people, <f>ⓠ</f>who dwell in Zion, <f>ⓡ</f>be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as <f>ⓢ</f>the Egyptians did.

Romans 8-1 <pb/>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. <f>[1]</f>
Romans 8-2 For the law of <f>ⓐ</f>the Spirit of life <f>ⓑ</f>has set you <f>[2]</f> free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.
Romans 8-3 For <f>ⓒ</f>God has done what the law, <f>ⓓ</f>weakened by the flesh, <f>ⓔ</f>could not do. <f>ⓕ</f>By sending his own Son <f>ⓖ</f>in the likeness of sinful flesh and <f>ⓗ</f>for sin, <f>[3]</f> he condemned sin in the flesh,
Romans 8-4 in order that <f>ⓘ</f>the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, <f>ⓙ</f>who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
Romans 8-5 For <f>ⓚ</f>those who live according to the flesh set their minds on <f>ⓛ</f>the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on <f>ⓜ</f>the things of the Spirit.
Romans 8-6 For to set <f>ⓝ</f>the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
Romans 8-7 For the mind that is set on the flesh is <f>ⓞ</f>hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; <f>ⓟ</f>indeed, it cannot.
Romans 8-8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
Romans 8-9 <pb/>You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact <f>ⓠ</f>the Spirit of God dwells in you. <f>ⓡ</f>Anyone who does not have <f>ⓢ</f>the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.
Romans 8-10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
Romans 8-11 If the Spirit of <f>ⓣ</f>him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus <f>[4]</f> from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies <f>ⓤ</f>through his Spirit who dwells in you.
Romans 8-12 <pb/>So then, brothers, <f>[5]</f> we are debtors, <f>ⓥ</f>not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
Romans 8-13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you <f>ⓦ</f>put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
Romans 8-14 For all who are <f>ⓧ</f>led by the Spirit of God are <f>ⓨ</f>sons <f>[6]</f> of God.
Romans 8-15 For <f>ⓩ</f>you did not receive <f>ⓐ</f>the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of <f>ⓑ</f>adoption as sons, by whom we cry, <f>ⓒ</f>“Abba! Father!”
Romans 8-16 <f>ⓓ</f> The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
Romans 8-17 and if children, then <f>ⓔ</f>heirs — heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, <f>ⓕ</f>provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.
Romans 8-18 <pb/>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time <f>ⓖ</f>are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
Romans 8-19 For the creation waits with eager longing for <f>ⓗ</f>the revealing of the sons of God.
Romans 8-20 For the creation <f>ⓘ</f>was subjected to futility, not willingly, but <f>ⓙ</f>because of him who subjected it, in hope
Romans 8-21 that <f>ⓚ</f>the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
Romans 8-22 For we know that <f>ⓛ</f>the whole creation <f>ⓜ</f>has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.
Romans 8-23 And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have <f>ⓝ</f>the firstfruits of the Spirit, <f>ⓞ</f>groan inwardly as <f>ⓟ</f>we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, <f>ⓠ</f>the redemption of our bodies.
Romans 8-24 For <f>ⓡ</f>in this hope we were saved. Now <f>ⓢ</f>hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?
Romans 8-25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we <f>ⓣ</f>wait for it with patience.
Romans 8-26 <pb/>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For <f>ⓤ</f>we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but <f>ⓥ</f>the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
Romans 8-27 And <f>ⓦ</f>he who searches hearts knows what is <f>ⓧ</f>the mind of the Spirit, because <f>[7]</f> the Spirit <f>ⓨ</f>intercedes for the saints <f>ⓩ</f>according to the will of God.
Romans 8-28 And we know that for those who love God all things work together <f>ⓐ</f>for good, <f>[8]</f> for <f>ⓑ</f>those who are called according to his purpose.
Romans 8-29 For those whom he <f>ⓒ</f>foreknew he also <f>ⓓ</f>predestined <f>ⓔ</f>to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be <f>ⓕ</f>the firstborn among many brothers.
Romans 8-30 And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also <f>ⓖ</f>justified, and those whom he justified he also <f>ⓗ</f>glorified.
Romans 8-31 <pb/>What then shall we say to these things? <f>ⓘ</f>If God is for us, who can be <f>[9]</f> against us?
Romans 8-32 <f>ⓙ</f> He who did not spare his own Son but <f>ⓚ</f>gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
Romans 8-33 Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? <f>ⓛ</f>It is God who justifies.
Romans 8-34 <f>ⓜ</f> Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died — more than that, who was raised — <f>ⓝ</f>who is at the right hand of God, <f>ⓞ</f>who indeed is interceding for us. <f>[10]</f>
Romans 8-35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
Romans 8-36 As it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f>“For your sake <f>ⓠ</f>we are being killed all the day long; </t><t>we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” </t>
Romans 8-37 <pb/>No, in all these things we are more than <f>ⓡ</f>conquerors through <f>ⓢ</f>him who loved us.
Romans 8-38 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
Romans 8-39 nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
