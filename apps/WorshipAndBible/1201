13-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was <f>ⓑ</f>Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David's son, loved her.
13-2 And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.
13-3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Shimeah, David's brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man.
13-4 And he said to him, “O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.”
13-5 Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.’”
13-6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and <f>ⓓ</f>make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”
13-7 <pb/>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him.”
13-8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.
13-9 And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, <f>ⓔ</f>“Send out everyone from me.” So everyone went out from him.
13-10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
13-11 But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”
13-12 She answered him, “No, my brother, do not violate <f>[1]</f> me, for <f>ⓕ</f>such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this <f>ⓖ</f>outrageous thing.
13-13 As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of <f>ⓗ</f>the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”
13-14 But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.
13-15 <pb/>Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Get up! Go!”
13-16 But she said to him, “No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me.” <f>[2]</f> But he would not listen to her.
13-17 He called the young man who served him and said, “Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.”
13-18 Now she was wearing <f>ⓘ</f>a long robe with sleeves, <f>[3]</f> for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her.
13-19 And Tamar <f>ⓙ</f>put ashes on her head and <f>ⓚ</f>tore the long robe that she wore. And <f>ⓛ</f>she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.
13-20 <pb/>And her brother Absalom said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart.” So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house.
13-21 When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. <f>[4]</f>
13-22 But Absalom spoke to Amnon <f>ⓜ</f>neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.
13-23 <pb/>After two full years Absalom had <f>ⓝ</f>sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
13-24 And Absalom came to the king and said, “Behold, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”
13-25 But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.
13-26 Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”
13-27 But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
13-28 Then Absalom commanded his servants, “Mark when Amnon's <f>ⓞ</f>heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.”
13-29 So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.
13-30 <pb/>While they were on the way, news came to David, “Absalom has struck down all the king's sons, and not one of them is left.”
13-31 Then the king arose and <f>ⓟ</f>tore his garments and <f>ⓠ</f>lay on the earth. And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments.
13-32 But <f>ⓡ</f>Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, “Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar.
13-33 Now therefore let not my lord the king so <f>ⓢ</f>take it to heart as to suppose that all the king's sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead.”
13-34 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him <f>[5]</f> by the side of the mountain.
13-35 And Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king's sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.”
13-36 And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king's sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.
13-37 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> But Absalom fled and went to <f>ⓥ</f>Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of <f>ⓦ</f>Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day.
13-38 <f>ⓧ</f> So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
13-39 And the spirit of the king <f>[6]</f> longed to go out <f>[7]</f> to Absalom, because <f>ⓨ</f>he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead.
17-1 <pb/><t><pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Better is a dry morsel with quiet </t><t>than a house full of feasting <f>[1]</f> with strife.</t>

17-8 <t><f>ⓜ</f> A bribe is like a magic <f>[2]</f> stone in the eyes of the one who gives it; </t><t>wherever he turns he prospers.</t>
17-9 <t>Whoever <f>ⓝ</f>covers an offense seeks love, </t><t>but he who repeats a matter <f>ⓞ</f>separates close friends.</t>
17-10 <t>A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding </t><t>than a hundred blows into a fool.</t>
17-11 <t>An evil man seeks only rebellion, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>a cruel messenger will be sent against him.</t>
17-12 <t>Let a man meet <f>ⓠ</f>a she-bear robbed of her cubs </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>rather than a fool in his folly.</t>
17-13 <t>If anyone <f>ⓢ</f>returns evil for good, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>evil will not depart from his house.</t>
17-14 <t>The beginning of strife is like letting out water, </t><t>so <f>ⓤ</f>quit before the quarrel breaks out.</t>
17-15 <t>He who <f>ⓥ</f>justifies the wicked and he who <f>ⓦ</f>condemns the righteous </t><t>are both alike an abomination to the LORD.</t>
17-16 <t>Why should a fool have money in his hand <f>ⓧ</f>to buy wisdom </t><t>when he has no sense?</t>
17-17 <t><f>ⓨ</f> A friend loves at all times, </t><t>and a brother is born for adversity.</t>
17-18 <t>One who lacks sense gives a pledge </t><t>and puts up security in the presence of his neighbor.</t>
17-19 <t>Whoever loves transgression loves strife; </t><t>he who <f>ⓩ</f>makes his door high seeks destruction.</t>
17-20 <t><f>ⓐ</f> A man of crooked heart does not discover good, </t><t>and one with a dishonest tongue falls into calamity.</t>
17-21 <t>He who <f>ⓑ</f>sires a fool gets himself sorrow, </t><t>and the father of a fool has no joy.</t>
17-22 <t><f>ⓒ</f> A joyful heart is good medicine, </t><t>but a crushed spirit <f>ⓓ</f>dries up the bones.</t>
17-23 <t>The wicked accepts <f>ⓔ</f>a bribe in secret <f>[3]</f> </t><t>to <f>ⓕ</f>pervert the ways of justice.</t>
17-24 <t><f>ⓖ</f> The discerning sets his face toward wisdom, </t><t>but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.</t>
17-25 <t><f>ⓗ</f> A foolish son is a grief to his father </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>and bitterness to <f>ⓙ</f>her who bore him.</t>
17-26 <t><f>ⓚ</f> To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good, </t><t>nor to strike the noble for their uprightness.</t>
17-27 <t>Whoever <f>ⓛ</f>restrains his words has knowledge, </t><t>and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.</t>
17-28 <t>Even a fool <f>ⓜ</f>who keeps silent is considered wise; </t><t>when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent. </t>
13-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>before <f>ⓑ</f>the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that <f>ⓒ</f>his hour had come <f>ⓓ</f>to depart out of this world to the Father, <f>ⓔ</f>having loved <f>ⓕ</f>his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
13-2 During supper, when <f>ⓖ</f>the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,
13-3 Jesus, knowing <f>ⓗ</f>that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that <f>ⓘ</f>he had come from God and <f>ⓙ</f>was going back to God,
13-4 rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, <f>ⓚ</f>tied it around his waist.
13-5 Then he <f>ⓛ</f>poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
13-6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”
13-7 <f>ⓜ</f> Jesus answered him, <J>“What I am doing <f>ⓝ</f>you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.”</J>
13-8 <f>ⓞ</f> Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.”</J>
13-9 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!”
13-10 Jesus said to him, <J>“The one who has bathed does not need to wash, <f>ⓠ</f>except for his feet, <f>[1]</f> but is completely clean. And <f>ⓡ</f>you <f>[2]</f> are clean, <f>ⓢ</f>but not every one of you.”</J>
13-11 <f>ⓣ</f> For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, <J>“Not all of you are clean.”</J>
13-12 <pb/>When he had washed their feet and <f>ⓤ</f>put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“Do you understand what I have done to you?</J>
13-13 <J><f>ⓦ</f> You call me <f>ⓧ</f>Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</J>
13-14 <J>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, <f>ⓨ</f>you also ought to wash one another's feet.</J>
13-15 <J>For I have given you an example, <f>ⓩ</f>that you also should do just as I have done to you.</J>
13-16 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓐ</f>a servant <f>[3]</f> is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</J>
13-17 <J>If you know these things, <f>ⓑ</f>blessed are you if you do them.</J>
13-18 <J><f>ⓒ</f> I am not speaking of all of you; I know <f>ⓓ</f>whom I have chosen. But <f>ⓔ</f>the Scripture will be fulfilled, <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>‘He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.’</J>
13-19 <J><f>ⓖ</f> I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.</J>
13-20 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓗ</f>whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.”</J>
13-21 <pb/>After saying these things, <f>ⓘ</f>Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓚ</f>one of you will betray me.”</J>
13-22 <f>ⓛ</f> The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.
13-23 <f>ⓜ</f> One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table <f>ⓝ</f>at Jesus' side, <f>[5]</f>
13-24 so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus <f>[6]</f> of whom he was speaking.
13-25 <f>ⓞ</f> So that disciple, <f>ⓟ</f>leaning back against Jesus, said to him, “Lord, who is it?”
13-26 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread <f>ⓡ</f>when I have dipped it.”</J> So when he had dipped the morsel, <f>ⓢ</f>he gave it to Judas, <f>ⓣ</f>the son of Simon Iscariot.
13-27 Then after he had taken the morsel, <f>ⓤ</f>Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“What you are going to do, do quickly.”</J>
13-28 Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.
13-29 Some thought that, <f>ⓦ</f>because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need <f>ⓧ</f>for the feast,” or that he should <f>ⓨ</f>give something to the poor.
13-30 So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. <f>ⓩ</f>And it was night.
13-31 <pb/>When he had gone out, Jesus said, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“Now is the Son of Man glorified, and <f>ⓑ</f>God is glorified in him.</J>
13-32 <J>If God is glorified in him, <f>ⓒ</f>God will also glorify him in himself, and <f>ⓓ</f>glorify him at once.</J>
13-33 <J>Little children, <f>ⓔ</f>yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just <f>ⓕ</f>as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’</J>
13-34 <J><f>ⓖ</f> A new commandment <f>ⓗ</f>I give to you, <f>ⓘ</f>that you love one another: <f>ⓙ</f>just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.</J>
13-35 <J><f>ⓚ</f> By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</J>
13-36 <pb/>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” <f>ⓛ</f>Jesus answered him, <J>“Where I am going <f>ⓜ</f>you cannot follow me now, <f>ⓝ</f>but you will follow afterward.”</J>
13-37 <f>ⓞ</f> Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
13-38 Jesus answered, <J>“Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓟ</f>the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.</J>
