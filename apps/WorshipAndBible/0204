Isaiah 31-1 <pb/><t>Woe <f>[1]</f> to <f>ⓐ</f>those who go down to Egypt for help </t><t>and rely on horses, </t><t>who <f>ⓑ</f>trust in chariots because they are many </t><t>and in horsemen because they are very strong, </t><t>but <f>ⓒ</f>do not look to the Holy One of Israel </t><t>or consult the LORD!</t>
Isaiah 31-2 <t>And <f>ⓓ</f>yet he is wise and brings disaster; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>he does not call back his words, </t><t>but <f>ⓕ</f>will arise against the house of the evildoers </t><t>and against the helpers of <f>ⓖ</f>those who work iniquity.</t>
Isaiah 31-3 <t>The Egyptians are man, and not God, </t><t>and their horses <f>ⓗ</f>are flesh, and not spirit. </t><t>When the LORD stretches out his hand, </t><t>the helper will stumble, and he who is helped will fall, </t><t>and they will all perish together. </t>
Isaiah 31-4 <pb/><t>For thus the LORD said to me, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>“As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey, </t><t>and when a band of shepherds is called out against him </t><t>he is not terrified by their shouting </t><t>or daunted at their noise, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>so the LORD of hosts will come down </t><t>to fight <f>[2]</f> on Mount Zion and on its hill.</t>
Isaiah 31-5 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Like birds hovering, so the LORD of hosts </t><t>will protect Jerusalem; </t><t>he will protect and deliver it; </t><t>he will spare and rescue it.” </t>
Isaiah 31-6 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Turn to him from whom people <f>[3]</f> have <f>ⓜ</f>deeply revolted, O children of Israel.
Isaiah 31-7 For in that day <f>ⓝ</f>everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have sinfully made for you.
Isaiah 31-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> “And the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man; </t><t>and a sword, not of man, shall devour him; </t><t>and he shall flee from the sword, </t><t>and his young men shall be <f>ⓟ</f>put to forced labor.</t>
Isaiah 31-9 <t><f>ⓠ</f> His rock shall pass away in terror, </t><t>and his officers desert the standard in panic,” </t><t>declares the LORD, whose <f>ⓡ</f>fire is in Zion, </t><t>and whose <f>ⓢ</f>furnace is in Jerusalem. </t>
1 Corinthians 13-1 <pb/>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
1 Corinthians 13-2 And if I have <f>ⓐ</f>prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, <f>ⓑ</f>so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
1 Corinthians 13-3 <f>ⓒ</f> If I give away all I have, and <f>ⓓ</f>if I deliver up my body to be burned, <f>[1]</f> but have not love, I gain nothing.
1 Corinthians 13-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Love is patient and <f>ⓕ</f>kind; love <f>ⓖ</f>does not envy or boast; it <f>ⓗ</f>is not arrogant
1 Corinthians 13-5 or rude. It <f>ⓘ</f>does not insist on its own way; it <f>ⓙ</f>is not irritable or resentful; <f>[2]</f>
1 Corinthians 13-6 it <f>ⓚ</f>does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but <f>ⓛ</f>rejoices with the truth.
1 Corinthians 13-7 <f>ⓜ</f> Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, <f>ⓝ</f>endures all things.
1 Corinthians 13-8 <pb/>Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
1 Corinthians 13-9 For <f>ⓞ</f>we know in part and we prophesy in part,
1 Corinthians 13-10 but <f>ⓟ</f>when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
1 Corinthians 13-11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
1 Corinthians 13-12 For <f>ⓠ</f>now we see in a mirror dimly, but <f>ⓡ</f>then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as <f>ⓢ</f>I have been fully known.
1 Corinthians 13-13 <pb/>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
