40-1 <pb/>Some time after this, the <f>ⓐ</f>cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt.
40-2 And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
40-3 <f>ⓑ</f> and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
40-4 The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody.
40-5 <pb/>And one night they both dreamed — the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison — each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation.
40-6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.
40-7 So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, <f>ⓒ</f>“Why are your faces downcast today?”
40-8 They said to him, <f>ⓓ</f>“We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” And Joseph said to them, <f>ⓔ</f>“Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.”
40-9 <pb/>So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, “In my dream there was a vine before me,
40-10 and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.
40-11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.”
40-12 Then Joseph said to him, <f>ⓕ</f>“This is its interpretation: <f>ⓖ</f>the three branches are three days.
40-13 In three days Pharaoh will <f>ⓗ</f>lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer.
40-14 Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.
40-15 For <f>ⓘ</f>I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and <f>ⓙ</f>here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.”
40-16 <pb/>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,
40-17 and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.”
40-18 And Joseph answered and said, <f>ⓚ</f>“This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
40-19 <f>ⓛ</f> In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head — from you! — and <f>ⓜ</f>hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you.”
40-20 <pb/>On the third day, which was Pharaoh's <f>ⓝ</f>birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and <f>ⓞ</f>lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
40-21 <f>ⓟ</f> He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and <f>ⓠ</f>he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.
40-22 But he <f>ⓡ</f>hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
40-23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
2-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now these were the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of those exiles <f>ⓑ</f>whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried captive to Babylonia. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town.
2-2 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, <f>ⓒ</f>Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. <pb/>The number of the men of the people of Israel:

2-58 <pb/>All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants were 392.
2-59 <pb/>The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, <f>ⓜ</f>though they could not prove their fathers' houses or their descent, whether they belonged to Israel:
2-60 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, and the sons of Nekoda, 652.
2-61 Also, of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, and the sons of <f>ⓝ</f>Barzillai (who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name).
2-62 These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but they were not found there, and <f>ⓞ</f>so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
2-63 The <f>ⓟ</f>governor told them that they were not <f>ⓠ</f>to partake of the most holy food, until there should be a priest to consult <f>ⓡ</f>Urim and Thummim.
2-64 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> The whole assembly together was 42,360,
2-65 besides their male and female servants, of whom there were 7,337, and they had 200 male and female <f>ⓣ</f>singers.
2-66 Their horses were 736, their mules were 245,
2-67 their camels were 435, and their donkeys were 6,720.
2-68 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Some of the heads of families, when they came to the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem, made freewill offerings for the house of God, to erect it on its site.
2-69 According to their ability they gave to <f>ⓥ</f>the treasury of the work 61,000 darics <f>[1]</f> of gold, 5,000 minas <f>[2]</f> of silver, and 100 priests' garments.
2-70 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Now the priests, the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their towns, and all the rest of Israel <f>[3]</f> in their towns.
25-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
25-2 which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
25-3 “For twenty-three years, <f>ⓑ</f>from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken <f>ⓒ</f>persistently to you, <f>ⓓ</f>but you have not listened.
25-4 <f>ⓔ</f> You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the LORD <f>ⓕ</f>persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets,
25-5 saying, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Turn now, every one of you, <f>ⓗ</f>from his evil way and evil deeds, and <f>ⓘ</f>dwell upon the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers from of old and forever.
25-6 <f>ⓙ</f> Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, <f>ⓚ</f>or provoke me to anger <f>ⓛ</f>with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’
25-7 <f>ⓜ</f> Yet you have not listened to me, declares the LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>that you might provoke me to anger <f>ⓞ</f>with the work of your hands to your own harm.
25-8 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words,
25-9 <f>ⓟ</f> behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, declares the LORD, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, <f>ⓠ</f>my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction, <f>ⓡ</f>and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.
25-10 Moreover, <f>ⓢ</f>I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, <f>ⓣ</f>the grinding of the millstones and <f>ⓤ</f>the light of the lamp.
25-11 <f>ⓥ</f> This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and <f>ⓦ</f>these nations shall serve the king of Babylon <f>ⓧ</f>seventy years.
25-12 Then after <f>ⓨ</f>seventy years are completed, <f>ⓩ</f>I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, <f>ⓐ</f>the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>making the land an everlasting waste.
25-13 I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written <f>ⓒ</f>in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
25-14 <f>ⓓ</f> For many nations <f>ⓔ</f>and great kings shall make slaves even of them, <f>ⓕ</f>and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”
25-15 <pb/>Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: <f>ⓖ</f>“Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
25-16 They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of <f>ⓗ</f>the sword that I am sending among them.”
25-17 <pb/>So I took the cup from the LORD's hand, <f>ⓘ</f>and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it:
25-18 <f>ⓙ</f> Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials, <f>ⓚ</f>to make them a desolation and a waste, a hissing and a curse, as at this day;
25-19 <f>ⓛ</f> Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, all his people,
25-20 and <f>ⓜ</f>all the mixed tribes among them; all the kings of <f>ⓝ</f>the land of Uz and all the kings of <f>ⓞ</f>the land of the Philistines (<f>ⓟ</f>Ashkelon, <f>ⓠ</f>Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of <f>ⓡ</f>Ashdod);
25-21 <f>ⓢ</f> Edom, <f>ⓣ</f>Moab, and the sons of <f>ⓤ</f>Ammon;
25-22 all the kings of <f>ⓥ</f>Tyre, all the kings of <f>ⓦ</f>Sidon, and the kings of the coastland across <f>ⓧ</f>the sea;
25-23 <f>ⓨ</f> Dedan, <f>ⓩ</f>Tema, <f>ⓐ</f>Buz, and all who cut <f>ⓑ</f>the corners of their hair;
25-24 all the <f>ⓒ</f>kings of Arabia and all the kings of <f>ⓓ</f>the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert;
25-25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of <f>ⓔ</f>Elam, and all the kings of <f>ⓕ</f>Media;
25-26 all the kings of <f>ⓖ</f>the north, far and near, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of <f>ⓗ</f>Babylon <f>[1]</f> shall drink.
25-27 <pb/>“Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓘ</f>Drink, be drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more, because of <f>ⓙ</f>the sword that I am sending among you.’
25-28 <pb/>“And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓚ</f>You must drink!
25-29 For behold, <f>ⓛ</f>I begin to work disaster at the city that is called by my name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, <f>ⓜ</f>for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of hosts.’
25-30 <pb/>“You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“‘The LORD will roar from on high, </t><t>and from his holy habitation utter his voice; </t><t>he will roar mightily against his fold, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and shout, like those who tread grapes, </t><t>against all the inhabitants of the earth.</t>
25-31 <t>The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, </t><t>for <f>ⓟ</f>the LORD has an indictment against the nations; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>he is entering into judgment with all flesh, </t><t>and the wicked he will put to the sword, <pb/>declares the LORD.’ </t>
25-32 <pb/><t>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: </t><t>Behold, disaster is going forth </t><t>from nation to nation, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>and a great tempest is stirring </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>from the farthest parts of the earth! </t>
25-33 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> “And those pierced by the LORD on that day shall extend from one end of the earth to the other. <f>ⓤ</f>They shall not be lamented, <f>ⓥ</f>or gathered, or buried; <f>ⓦ</f>they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.
25-34 <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f> “Wail, <f>ⓨ</f>you shepherds, and cry out, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>and roll in ashes, you lords of the flock, </t><t>for the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come, </t><t>and you shall fall like a choice vessel.</t>
25-35 <t>No refuge will remain <f>ⓐ</f>for the shepherds, </t><t>nor escape for the lords of the flock.</t>
25-36 <t>A voice — the cry <f>ⓑ</f>of the shepherds, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and the wail of the lords of the flock! </t><t>For the LORD is laying waste their pasture,</t>
25-37 <t><f>ⓓ</f> and the peaceful folds are devastated </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</t>
25-38 <t>Like a lion <f>ⓕ</f>he has left his lair, </t><t>for their land has become a waste </t><t>because of <f>ⓖ</f>the sword of the oppressor, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and because of his fierce anger.” </t>
3-1 <pb/>Therefore, holy brothers, <f>[1]</f> you who share in <f>ⓐ</f>a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>the apostle and high priest of our confession,
3-2 who was faithful to him who appointed him, <f>ⓒ</f>just as Moses also was faithful in all God's <f>[2]</f> house.
3-3 For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses — as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
3-4 (For every house is built by someone, but <f>ⓓ</f>the builder of all things is God.)
3-5 <f>ⓔ</f> Now Moses was faithful in all God's house <f>ⓕ</f>as a servant, <f>ⓖ</f>to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,
3-6 but Christ is faithful over God's house as <f>ⓗ</f>a son. And <f>ⓘ</f>we are his house, if indeed we <f>ⓙ</f>hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope. <f>[3]</f>
3-7 <pb/>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“Today, if you hear his voice,</t>
3-8 <t>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, </t><t>on the day of testing in the wilderness,</t>
3-9 <t>where your fathers put me to the test </t><t>and saw my works for <f>ⓛ</f>forty years.</t>
3-10 <t>Therefore I was provoked with that generation, </t><t>and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart; </t><t>they have not known my ways.’</t>
3-11 <t><f>ⓜ</f> As I swore in my wrath, </t><t>‘They shall not enter my rest.’” </t>
3-12 <pb/>Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from <f>ⓝ</f>the living God.
3-13 But <f>ⓞ</f>exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by <f>ⓟ</f>the deceitfulness of sin.
3-14 For we have come to share in Christ, <f>ⓠ</f>if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.
3-15 As it is said, <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f>“Today, if you hear his voice, </t><t>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.” </t>
3-16 <pb/>For <f>ⓢ</f>who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not <f>ⓣ</f>all those who left Egypt led by Moses?
3-17 And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, <f>ⓤ</f>whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
3-18 And to whom did he swear that <f>ⓥ</f>they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
3-19 So we see that <f>ⓦ</f>they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
