20-1 <pb/>Now there happened to be there <f>ⓐ</f>a worthless man, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. And he blew the trumpet and said, <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f>“We have no portion in David, </t><t>and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>every man to his tents, O Israel!” </t>
20-2 <pb/>So all the men of Israel withdrew from David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah followed their king steadfastly from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
20-3 <pb/>And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took <f>ⓓ</f>the ten concubines whom he had left to care for the house and put them in a house under guard and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up until the day of their death, living as if in widowhood.
20-4 <pb/>Then the king said to <f>ⓔ</f>Amasa, “Call the men of Judah together to me within three days, and be here yourself.”
20-5 So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he delayed beyond the set time that had been appointed him.
20-6 And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take <f>ⓕ</f>your lord's servants and pursue him, lest he get himself to fortified cities and escape from us.” <f>[1]</f>
20-7 And there went out after him Joab's men and the <f>ⓖ</f>Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men. They went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
20-8 When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing a soldier's garment, and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened on his thigh, and as he went forward it fell out.
20-9 And Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand <f>ⓗ</f>to kiss him.
20-10 But Amasa did not observe the sword that was in Joab's hand. <f>ⓘ</f>So Joab struck him with it <f>ⓙ</f>in the stomach and spilled his entrails to the ground without striking a second blow, and he died. <pb/>Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.
20-11 And one of Joab's young men took his stand by Amasa and said, “Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab.”
20-12 And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway. And anyone who came by, seeing him, stopped. And when the man saw that all the people stopped, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field and threw a garment over him.
20-13 When he was taken out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
20-14 <pb/>And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to <f>ⓚ</f>Abel of <f>ⓛ</f>Beth-maacah, <f>[2]</f> and all <f>ⓜ</f>the Bichrites <f>[3]</f> assembled and followed him in.
20-15 And all the men who were with Joab came and besieged him in <f>ⓝ</f>Abel of Beth-maacah. <f>ⓞ</f>They cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart, and they were battering the wall to throw it down.
20-16 Then a wise woman called from the city, “Listen! Listen! Tell Joab, ‘Come here, that I may speak to you.’”
20-17 And he came near her, and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” And he answered, “I am listening.”
20-18 Then she said, “They used to say in former times, ‘Let them but ask counsel at <f>ⓟ</f>Abel,’ and so they settled a matter.
20-19 I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why will you <f>ⓠ</f>swallow up <f>ⓡ</f>the heritage of the LORD?”
20-20 Joab answered, “Far be it from me, far be it, that I should <f>ⓢ</f>swallow up or destroy!
20-21 That is not true. But a man of <f>ⓣ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, called Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David. Give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.”
20-22 Then the woman went to all the people <f>ⓤ</f>in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it out to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, <f>ⓥ</f>every man to his home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
20-23 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
20-24 and <f>ⓧ</f>Adoram was in charge of the forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
20-25 and Sheva was secretary; and <f>ⓨ</f>Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
20-26 and <f>ⓩ</f>Ira the Jairite was also David's priest.
24-1 <pb/><t><pb/>Be not <f>ⓐ</f>envious of evil men, </t><t>nor desire to be <f>ⓑ</f>with them,</t>
24-2 <t>for their hearts <f>ⓒ</f>devise violence, </t><t>and their lips <f>ⓓ</f>talk of trouble. </t>
24-3 <pb/><t>By <f>ⓔ</f>wisdom a house is built, </t><t>and by understanding it is established;</t>
24-4 <t>by knowledge the rooms are filled </t><t>with all <f>ⓕ</f>precious and pleasant riches.</t>
24-5 <t><f>ⓖ</f> A wise man is full of strength, </t><t>and a man of knowledge enhances his might,</t>
24-6 <t>for by <f>ⓗ</f>wise guidance you can wage your war, </t><t>and in <f>ⓘ</f>abundance of counselors there is victory.</t>
24-7 <t>Wisdom is <f>ⓙ</f>too high for a fool; </t><t>in <f>ⓚ</f>the gate he does not open his mouth. </t>
24-8 <pb/><t>Whoever <f>ⓛ</f>plans to do evil </t><t>will be called a schemer.</t>
24-9 <t><f>ⓜ</f> The devising <f>[1]</f> of folly is sin, </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>the scoffer is an abomination to mankind. </t>
24-10 <pb/><t>If you <f>ⓞ</f>faint in the day of adversity, </t><t>your strength is small.</t>
24-11 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Rescue those who are being taken away to death; </t><t>hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.</t>
24-12 <t>If you say, “Behold, we did not know this,” </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>does not he who <f>ⓡ</f>weighs the heart perceive it? </t><t>Does not he who <f>ⓢ</f>keeps watch over your soul know it, </t><t>and will he not repay man <f>ⓣ</f>according to his work? </t>
24-13 <pb/><t>My son, <f>ⓤ</f>eat honey, for it is good, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.</t>
24-14 <t>Know that wisdom is such to your soul; </t><t>if you find it, there will be <f>ⓦ</f>a future, </t><t>and your hope will not be cut off. </t>
24-15 <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f> Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous; </t><t>do no violence to his home;</t>
24-16 <t><f>ⓨ</f> for the righteous falls <f>ⓩ</f>seven times and rises again, </t><t>but <f>ⓐ</f>the wicked stumble in times of calamity. </t>
24-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, </t><t>and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles,</t>
24-18 <t>lest the LORD see it and be displeased, </t><t>and turn away his anger from him. </t>
24-19 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> Fret not yourself because of evildoers, </t><t>and be not <f>ⓓ</f>envious of the wicked,</t>
24-20 <t>for the evil man has no <f>ⓔ</f>future; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the lamp of the wicked will be put out. </t>
24-21 <pb/><t>My son, <f>ⓖ</f>fear the LORD and the king, </t><t>and do not join with those who do otherwise,</t>
24-22 <t>for disaster will arise suddenly from them, </t><t>and who knows the ruin that will come from them both? </t>
24-23 <pb/>These also are sayings of <f>ⓗ</f>the wise. <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f>Partiality in judging is not good.</t>
24-24 <t>Whoever <f>ⓙ</f>says to the wicked, “You are in the right,” </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>will be cursed by peoples, abhorred by nations,</t>
24-25 <t>but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight, </t><t>and a good blessing will come upon them.</t>
24-26 <t>Whoever gives an honest answer </t><t>kisses the lips. </t>
24-27 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> Prepare your work outside; </t><t>get everything ready for yourself in the field, </t><t>and after that build your house. </t>
24-28 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause, </t><t>and do not deceive with your lips.</t>
24-29 <t>Do not say, <f>ⓝ</f>“I will do to him as he has done to me; </t><t>I will pay the man back for what he has done.” </t>
24-30 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> I passed by the field of a sluggard, </t><t>by the vineyard of a man <f>ⓟ</f>lacking sense,</t>
24-31 <t>and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns; </t><t>the ground was covered with nettles, </t><t>and its stone <f>ⓠ</f>wall was broken down.</t>
24-32 <t>Then I saw and <f>ⓡ</f>considered it; </t><t>I looked and received instruction.</t>
24-33 <t><f>ⓢ</f> A little sleep, a little slumber, </t><t>a little folding of the hands to rest,</t>
24-34 <t>and poverty will come upon you like a robber, </t><t>and want like an armed man. </t>
20-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that <f>ⓑ</f>the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
20-2 So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, <f>ⓒ</f>the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and <f>ⓓ</f>we do not know where they have laid him.”
20-3 <f>ⓔ</f> So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.
20-4 Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
20-5 And stooping to look in, he saw <f>ⓕ</f>the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.
20-6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there,
20-7 and <f>ⓖ</f>the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' <f>[1]</f> head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself.
20-8 Then the other disciple, <f>ⓗ</f>who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;
20-9 for as yet <f>ⓘ</f>they did not understand the Scripture, <f>ⓙ</f>that he must rise from the dead.
20-10 Then the disciples went back to their homes.
20-11 <pb/>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.
20-12 And <f>ⓚ</f>she saw <f>ⓛ</f>two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet.
20-13 They said to her, <f>ⓜ</f>“Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, <f>ⓝ</f>“They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”
20-14 Having said this, she turned around and <f>ⓞ</f>saw Jesus standing, <f>ⓟ</f>but she did not know that it was Jesus.
20-15 Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“Woman, why are you weeping? <f>ⓡ</f>Whom are you seeking?”</J> Supposing him to be <f>ⓢ</f>the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
20-16 Jesus said to her, <J>“Mary.”</J> She turned and said to him in Aramaic, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓣ</f>“Rabboni!” (which means Teacher).
20-17 Jesus said to her, <J>“Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to <f>ⓤ</f>my brothers and say to them, <f>ⓥ</f>‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to <f>ⓦ</f>my God and your God.’”</J>
20-18 Mary Magdalene <f>ⓧ</f>went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord” — and that he had said these things to her.
20-19 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> On the evening <f>ⓩ</f>of that day, the first day of the week, <f>ⓐ</f>the doors being locked where the disciples were <f>ⓑ</f>for fear of the Jews, <f>[3]</f> Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“Peace be with you.”</J>
20-20 When he had said this, <f>ⓓ</f>he showed them his hands and his side. Then <f>ⓔ</f>the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
20-21 Jesus said to them again, <J>“Peace be with you. As <f>ⓕ</f>the Father has sent me, <f>ⓖ</f>even so I am sending you.”</J>
20-22 And when he had said this, he <f>ⓗ</f>breathed on them and said to them, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“Receive the Holy Spirit.</J>
20-23 <J><f>ⓙ</f> If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.”</J>
20-24 <pb/>Now <f>ⓚ</f>Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, <f>[4]</f> was not with them when Jesus came.
20-25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, <f>ⓛ</f>“Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.”
20-26 <pb/>Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. <f>ⓜ</f>Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“Peace be with you.”</J>
20-27 Then he said to Thomas, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.”</J>
20-28 Thomas answered him, <f>ⓟ</f>“My Lord and my God!”
20-29 Jesus said to him, <J>“Have you believed because you have seen me? <f>ⓠ</f>Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”</J>
20-30 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Now Jesus did many other signs <f>ⓢ</f>in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;
20-31 <f>ⓣ</f> but these are written so that you may <f>ⓤ</f>believe that Jesus is the Christ, <f>ⓥ</f>the Son of God, and that by believing <f>ⓦ</f>you may have life <f>ⓧ</f>in his name.
