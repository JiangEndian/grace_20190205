1 Samuel 31-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain <f>ⓑ</f>on Mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel 31-2 And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down <f>ⓒ</f>Jonathan and <f>ⓓ</f>Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
1 Samuel 31-3 <f>ⓔ</f> The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was badly wounded by the archers.
1 Samuel 31-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these <f>ⓖ</f>uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and mistreat me.” But his armor-bearer would not, <f>ⓗ</f>for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword <f>ⓘ</f>and fell upon it.
1 Samuel 31-5 And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.
1 Samuel 31-6 Thus Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, on the same day together.
1 Samuel 31-7 And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. And the Philistines came and lived in them.
1 Samuel 31-8 <pb/>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel 31-9 So they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, <f>ⓙ</f>to carry the good news <f>ⓚ</f>to the house of their idols and to the people.
1 Samuel 31-10 <f>ⓛ</f> They put his armor in the temple of <f>ⓜ</f>Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of <f>ⓝ</f>Beth-shan.
1 Samuel 31-11 <f>ⓞ</f> But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
1 Samuel 31-12 <f>ⓟ</f> all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh <f>ⓠ</f>and burned them there.
1 Samuel 31-13 And they took their bones <f>ⓡ</f>and buried them under <f>ⓢ</f>the tamarisk tree in Jabesh and <f>ⓣ</f>fasted seven days.

Luke 24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, <f>ⓑ</f>taking the spices they had prepared.
Luke 24-2 And they found <f>ⓒ</f>the stone rolled away from the tomb,
Luke 24-3 but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke 24-4 While they were perplexed about this, behold, <f>ⓓ</f>two <f>ⓔ</f>men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
Luke 24-5 And as they were <f>ⓕ</f>frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
Luke 24-6 He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, <f>ⓖ</f>while he was still in Galilee,
Luke 24-7 <f>ⓗ</f> that the Son of Man <f>ⓘ</f>must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and <f>ⓙ</f>be crucified and on <f>ⓚ</f>the third day rise.”
Luke 24-8 And <f>ⓛ</f>they remembered his words,
Luke 24-9 and returning from the tomb they <f>ⓜ</f>told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
Luke 24-10 Now it was <f>ⓝ</f>Mary Magdalene and <f>ⓞ</f>Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles,
Luke 24-11 but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and <f>ⓟ</f>they did not believe them.
Luke 24-12 But <f>ⓠ</f>Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw <f>ⓡ</f>the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.
Luke 24-13 <pb/>That very day <f>ⓢ</f>two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles <f>[1]</f> from Jerusalem,
Luke 24-14 and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
Luke 24-15 While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.
Luke 24-16 <f>ⓣ</f> But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
Luke 24-17 And he said to them, <J>“What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?”</J> And they stood still, looking sad.
Luke 24-18 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”
Luke 24-19 And he said to them, <J>“What things?”</J> And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was <f>ⓤ</f>a prophet <f>ⓥ</f>mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
Luke 24-20 and <f>ⓦ</f>how our chief priests and <f>ⓧ</f>rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
Luke 24-21 But we had hoped that he was <f>ⓨ</f>the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now <f>ⓩ</f>the third day since these things happened.
Luke 24-22 Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. <f>ⓐ</f>They were at the tomb early in the morning,
Luke 24-23 and <f>ⓑ</f>when they did not find his body, they came back saying that <f>ⓒ</f>they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
Luke 24-24 <f>ⓓ</f> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.”
Luke 24-25 And he said to them, <J>“O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</J>
Luke 24-26 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Was it not necessary that <f>ⓕ</f>the Christ should suffer these things and enter into <f>ⓖ</f>his glory?”</J>
Luke 24-27 And <f>ⓗ</f>beginning with <f>ⓘ</f>Moses and <f>ⓙ</f>all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
Luke 24-28 <pb/>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. <f>ⓚ</f>He acted as if he were going farther,
Luke 24-29 but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and <f>ⓛ</f>the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them.
Luke 24-30 When he was at table with them, he took the bread and <f>ⓜ</f>blessed and broke it and gave it to them.
Luke 24-31 <f>ⓝ</f> And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And <f>ⓞ</f>he vanished from their sight.
Luke 24-32 They said to each other, <f>ⓟ</f>“Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he <f>ⓠ</f>opened to us the Scriptures?”
Luke 24-33 And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they <f>ⓡ</f>found the eleven and <f>ⓢ</f>those who were with them gathered together,
Luke 24-34 saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and <f>ⓣ</f>has appeared to Simon!”
Luke 24-35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and <f>ⓤ</f>how he was known to them in <f>ⓥ</f>the breaking of the bread.
Luke 24-36 <pb/>As they were talking about these things, <f>ⓦ</f>Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <J>“Peace to you!”</J>
Luke 24-37 But they were <f>ⓧ</f>startled and <f>ⓨ</f>frightened and <f>ⓩ</f>thought they saw a spirit.
Luke 24-38 And he said to them, <J>“Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</J>
Luke 24-39 <J>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. <f>ⓐ</f>Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”</J>
Luke 24-40 And when he had said this, <f>ⓑ</f>he showed them his hands and his feet.
Luke 24-41 And while they still disbelieved <f>ⓒ</f>for joy and were marveling, <f>ⓓ</f>he said to them, <J>“Have you anything here to eat?”</J>
Luke 24-42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <f>[2]</f>
Luke 24-43 and he took it and ate before them.
Luke 24-44 <pb/>Then he said to them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, <f>ⓕ</f>that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”</J>
Luke 24-45 Then <f>ⓖ</f>he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
Luke 24-46 and said to them, <J>“Thus <f>ⓗ</f>it is written, <f>ⓘ</f>that the Christ should suffer and on the third day <f>ⓙ</f>rise from the dead,</J>
Luke 24-47 <J>and that <f>ⓚ</f>repentance for <f>[3]</f> the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed <f>ⓛ</f>in his name <f>ⓜ</f>to all nations, <f>ⓝ</f>beginning from Jerusalem.</J>
Luke 24-48 <J><f>ⓞ</f> You are witnesses of these things.</J>
Luke 24-49 <J>And behold, I am sending <f>ⓟ</f>the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you <f>ⓠ</f>are clothed with <f>ⓡ</f>power <f>ⓢ</f>from on high.”</J>
Luke 24-50 <pb/>And <f>ⓣ</f>he led them out as far as <f>ⓤ</f>Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.
Luke 24-51 While he blessed them, <f>ⓥ</f>he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.
Luke 24-52 And they <f>ⓦ</f>worshiped him and <f>ⓧ</f>returned to Jerusalem <f>ⓨ</f>with great joy,
Luke 24-53 and <f>ⓩ</f>were continually in the temple <f>ⓐ</f>blessing God.
