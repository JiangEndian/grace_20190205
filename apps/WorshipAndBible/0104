2 Kings 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> After the death of Ahab, Moab <f>ⓑ</f>rebelled against Israel.
2 Kings 1-2 <pb/>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, “Go, inquire of <f>ⓒ</f>Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, <f>ⓓ</f>whether I shall recover from this sickness.”
2 Kings 1-3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah <f>ⓔ</f>the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of <f>ⓕ</f>Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
2 Kings 1-4 Now therefore thus says the LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’” So Elijah went.
2 Kings 1-5 <pb/>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, “Why have you returned?”
2 Kings 1-6 And they said to him, “There came a man to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of <f>ⓗ</f>Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’”
2 Kings 1-7 He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?”
2 Kings 1-8 They answered him, <f>ⓘ</f>“He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”
2 Kings 1-9 <pb/>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, <f>ⓙ</f>“O man of God, the king says, ‘Come down.’”
2 Kings 1-10 But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, <f>ⓚ</f>let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings 1-11 <pb/>Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, “O man of God, this is the king's order, ‘Come down quickly!’”
2 Kings 1-12 But Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, <f>ⓛ</f>let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings 1-13 <pb/>Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him, “O man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, <f>ⓜ</f>be precious in your sight.
2 Kings 1-14 Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight.”
2 Kings 1-15 Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he arose and went down with him to the king
2 Kings 1-16 and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of <f>ⓝ</f>Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron — is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? — therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’”
2 Kings 1-17 <pb/>So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Jehoram became king in his place <f>ⓞ</f>in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.
2 Kings 1-18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

Acts 26-1 <pb/>So <f>ⓐ</f>Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:
Acts 26-2 <pb/>“I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today <f>ⓑ</f>against all the accusations of the Jews,
Acts 26-3 especially because you are familiar with all the <f>ⓒ</f>customs and <f>ⓓ</f>controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
Acts 26-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> “My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among <f>ⓕ</f>my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews.
Acts 26-5 They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that <f>ⓖ</f>according to the strictest <f>ⓗ</f>party of our <f>ⓘ</f>religion I have lived as <f>ⓙ</f>a Pharisee.
Acts 26-6 And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in <f>ⓚ</f>the promise made by God to our fathers,
Acts 26-7 <f>ⓛ</f> to which <f>ⓜ</f>our twelve tribes hope to <f>ⓝ</f>attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope <f>ⓞ</f>I am accused by Jews, O king!
Acts 26-8 Why is it thought <f>ⓟ</f>incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
Acts 26-9 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of <f>ⓡ</f>Jesus of Nazareth.
Acts 26-10 <f>ⓢ</f> And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority <f>ⓣ</f>from the chief priests, but <f>ⓤ</f>when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.
Acts 26-11 And <f>ⓥ</f>I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them <f>ⓦ</f>blaspheme, and <f>ⓧ</f>in raging fury against them I <f>ⓨ</f>persecuted them even to foreign cities.
Acts 26-12 <pb/>“In this connection <f>ⓩ</f>I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
Acts 26-13 At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me.
Acts 26-14 And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me <f>ⓐ</f>in the Hebrew language, <f>[1]</f> <J>‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’</J>
Acts 26-15 And I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, <J>‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</J>
Acts 26-16 <J>But rise and <f>ⓑ</f>stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, <f>ⓒ</f>to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,</J>
Acts 26-17 <J><f>ⓓ</f> delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles — <f>ⓔ</f>to whom I <f>ⓕ</f>am sending you</J>
Acts 26-18 <J><f>ⓖ</f> to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from <f>ⓗ</f>the power of Satan to God, that they may receive <f>ⓘ</f>forgiveness of sins and <f>ⓙ</f>a place among those who are sanctified <f>ⓚ</f>by faith in me.’</J>
Acts 26-19 <pb/>“Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to <f>ⓛ</f>the heavenly vision,
Acts 26-20 but declared first <f>ⓜ</f>to those in Damascus, <f>ⓝ</f>then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also <f>ⓞ</f>to the Gentiles, that they should <f>ⓟ</f>repent and <f>ⓠ</f>turn to God, performing deeds <f>ⓡ</f>in keeping with their repentance.
Acts 26-21 For this reason <f>ⓢ</f>the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
Acts 26-22 <f>ⓣ</f> To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so <f>ⓤ</f>I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what <f>ⓥ</f>the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:
Acts 26-23 <f>ⓦ</f> that the Christ <f>ⓧ</f>must suffer and that, <f>ⓨ</f>by being the first <f>ⓩ</f>to rise from the dead, <f>ⓐ</f>he would proclaim <f>ⓑ</f>light both to our people and to the Gentiles.”
Acts 26-24 <pb/>And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, <f>ⓒ</f>you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.”
Acts 26-25 But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, <f>ⓓ</f>most excellent Festus, but I am speaking <f>ⓔ</f>true and <f>ⓕ</f>rational words.
Acts 26-26 For <f>ⓖ</f>the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.
Acts 26-27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.”
Acts 26-28 And Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time would you persuade me to be <f>ⓗ</f>a Christian?” <f>[2]</f>
Acts 26-29 And Paul said, “Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day <f>ⓘ</f>might become such as I am — except for <f>ⓙ</f>these chains.”
Acts 26-30 <pb/>Then the king rose, and <f>ⓚ</f>the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them.
Acts 26-31 And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, <f>ⓛ</f>“This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.”
Acts 26-32 And Agrippa said to Festus, <f>ⓜ</f>“This man could have been set <f>ⓝ</f>free if he had not appealed <f>ⓞ</f>to Caesar.”
