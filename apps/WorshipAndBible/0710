Numbers 19-3 And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and <f>ⓑ</f>it shall be taken outside the camp and slaughtered before him.
Numbers 19-4 And Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and <f>ⓒ</f>sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
Numbers 19-5 And the heifer shall be burned in his sight. <f>ⓓ</f>Its skin, its flesh, and its blood, with its dung, shall be burned.
Numbers 19-6 And the priest shall take <f>ⓔ</f>cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet yarn, and throw them into the fire burning the heifer.

Numbers 19-8 <f>ⓖ</f> The one who burns the heifer <f>ⓗ</f>shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water and shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers 19-9 And a man who is clean shall gather up <f>ⓘ</f>the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a <f>ⓙ</f>clean place. And they shall be kept for the water for <f>ⓚ</f>impurity for the congregation of the people of Israel; it is a sin offering.
Numbers 19-10 And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer <f>ⓛ</f>shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. And this shall be a perpetual statute for the people of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them.
Numbers 19-11 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> “Whoever touches the dead body of any person shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers 19-12 He <f>ⓝ</f>shall cleanse himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean. But if he does not cleanse himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not become clean.
Numbers 19-13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of anyone who has died, and does not cleanse himself, <f>ⓞ</f>defiles the tabernacle of the LORD, <f>ⓟ</f>and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not thrown on him, he shall be unclean. His uncleanness is still on him.
Numbers 19-14 <pb/>“This is the law when someone dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers 19-15 And every <f>ⓠ</f>open vessel that has no cover fastened on it is unclean.
Numbers 19-16 <f>ⓡ</f> Whoever in the open field touches someone who was killed with a sword or who died naturally, or touches a human bone or a <f>ⓢ</f>grave, shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers 19-17 For the unclean they shall take <f>ⓣ</f>some ashes of the burnt sin offering, and fresh <f>[1]</f> water shall be added in a vessel.
Numbers 19-18 Then a clean person shall take <f>ⓤ</f>hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there and on whoever touched the bone, or the slain or the dead or the grave.
Numbers 19-19 And the clean person shall sprinkle it on the unclean <f>ⓥ</f>on the third day and on the seventh day. <f>ⓦ</f>Thus on the seventh day he shall cleanse him, and he shall <f>ⓧ</f>wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and at evening he shall be clean.
Numbers 19-20 <pb/>“If the man who is unclean does not cleanse himself, <f>ⓨ</f>that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, since he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. Because the water for impurity has not been thrown on him, he is unclean.
Numbers 19-21 And it shall be a statute forever for them. The one who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and the one who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers 19-22 And <f>ⓩ</f>whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and anyone who touches it shall be unclean until evening.”

Psalm 23-4 <pb/><t>Even though I <f>ⓗ</f>walk through the valley of <f>ⓘ</f>the shadow of death, <f>[3]</f> </t><t>I will <f>ⓙ</f>fear no evil, </t><t>for <f>ⓚ</f>you are with me; </t><t>your <f>ⓛ</f>rod and your staff, </t><t>they comfort me. </t>
Psalm 23-5 <pb/><t>You <f>ⓜ</f>prepare a table before me </t><t>in <f>ⓝ</f>the presence of my enemies; </t><t>you <f>ⓞ</f>anoint my head with oil; </t><t>my <f>ⓟ</f>cup overflows.</t>
Psalm 23-6 <t>Surely <f>[4]</f> goodness and mercy <f>[5]</f> shall follow me </t><t>all the days of my life, </t><t>and I shall <f>ⓠ</f>dwell <f>[6]</f> in the house of the LORD </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>forever. <f>[7]</f> </t>
Hosea 4-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Hear the word of the LORD, O children of Israel, </t><t>for <f>ⓑ</f>the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land. </t><t>There is no faithfulness or steadfast love, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>no knowledge of God in the land;</t>
Hosea 4-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> there is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; </t><t>they break all bounds, and <f>ⓔ</f>bloodshed follows bloodshed.</t>
Hosea 4-3 <t>Therefore <f>ⓕ</f>the land mourns, </t><t>and all who dwell in it languish, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>and also the beasts of the field </t><t>and the birds of the heavens, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and even the fish of the sea are taken away. </t>
Hosea 4-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Yet let no one contend, </t><t>and let none accuse, </t><t>for with you is <f>ⓙ</f>my contention, O priest. <f>[1]</f></t>
Hosea 4-5 <t>You shall stumble by day; </t><t>the prophet also shall stumble with you by night; </t><t>and I will destroy <f>ⓚ</f>your mother.</t>
Hosea 4-6 <t>My people are destroyed <f>ⓛ</f>for lack of knowledge; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>because you have rejected knowledge, </t><t>I reject you <f>ⓝ</f>from being a priest to me. </t><t>And since you have forgotten the law of your God, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>I also will forget your children. </t>
Hosea 4-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> The more they increased, </t><t>the more they sinned against me; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>I will change their glory into shame.</t>
Hosea 4-8 <t><f>ⓡ</f> They feed on the sin <f>[2]</f> of my people; </t><t>they are greedy for their iniquity.</t>
Hosea 4-9 <t><f>ⓢ</f> And it shall be like people, like priest; </t><t>I will punish them for their ways </t><t>and repay them for their deeds.</t>
Hosea 4-10 <t><f>ⓣ</f> They shall eat, but not be satisfied; </t><t>they shall play the whore, but not multiply, </t><t>because they have forsaken the LORD </t><t>to cherish </t>
Hosea 4-11 <t>whoredom, wine, and new wine, </t><t>which <f>ⓤ</f>take away the understanding.</t>
Hosea 4-12 <t>My people <f>ⓥ</f>inquire of a piece of wood, </t><t>and their walking staff gives them oracles. </t><t>For <f>ⓦ</f>a spirit of whoredom has led them astray, </t><t>and they have left their God to play the whore.</t>
Hosea 4-13 <t><f>ⓧ</f> They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains </t><t>and burn offerings on the hills, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>under oak, poplar, and terebinth, </t><t>because their shade is good. </t><t>Therefore your daughters play the whore, </t><t>and your brides commit adultery.</t>
Hosea 4-14 <t>I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore, </t><t>nor your brides when they commit adultery; </t><t>for <f>ⓩ</f>the men themselves go aside with prostitutes </t><t>and sacrifice with <f>ⓐ</f>cult prostitutes, </t><t>and a people <f>ⓑ</f>without understanding shall come to ruin. </t>
Hosea 4-15 <pb/><t>Though you play the whore, O <f>ⓒ</f>Israel, </t><t>let not <f>ⓓ</f>Judah become guilty. </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>Enter not into <f>ⓕ</f>Gilgal, </t><t>nor go up to <f>ⓖ</f>Beth-aven, </t><t>and swear not, “As the LORD lives.”</t>
Hosea 4-16 <t>Like a stubborn heifer, </t><t>Israel is stubborn; </t><t>can the LORD now feed them </t><t>like a lamb in a broad pasture? </t>
Hosea 4-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> Ephraim is joined to idols; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>leave him alone.</t>
