1-1 <pb/>In the <f>ⓐ</f>beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
1-2 The earth was <f>ⓑ</f>without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
1-3 <pb/>And God said, <f>ⓒ</f>“Let there be light,” and there was light.
1-4 And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.
1-5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
1-6 <pb/>And God said, <f>ⓓ</f>“Let there be an expanse <f>[1]</f> in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”
1-7 And God made <f>[2]</f> the expanse and <f>ⓔ</f>separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were <f>ⓕ</f>above the expanse. And it was so.
1-8 And God called the expanse Heaven. <f>[3]</f> And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
1-9 <pb/>And God said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.
1-10 God called the dry land Earth, <f>[4]</f> and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
1-11 <pb/>And God said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants <f>[5]</f> yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so.
1-12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
1-13 And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
1-14 <pb/>And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for <f>ⓘ</f>signs and for <f>ⓙ</f>seasons, <f>[6]</f> and for days and years,
1-15 and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so.
1-16 And God <f>ⓚ</f>made the two great lights — the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night — and the stars.
1-17 And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
1-18 to <f>ⓛ</f>rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
1-19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
1-20 <pb/>And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds <f>[7]</f> fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.”
1-21 So <f>ⓜ</f>God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
1-22 And God blessed them, saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
1-23 And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
1-24 <pb/>And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds — livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.
1-25 And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
1-26 <pb/>Then God said, <f>ⓞ</f>“Let us make man <f>[8]</f> in our image, <f>ⓟ</f>after our likeness. And <f>ⓠ</f>let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”
1-27 <pb/><t>So God created man in his own image, </t><t>in the image of God he created him; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>male and female he created them. </t>
1-28 <pb/>And God blessed them. And God said to them, <f>ⓢ</f>“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
1-29 And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. <f>ⓣ</f>You shall have them for food.
1-30 And <f>ⓤ</f>to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.
1-31 <f>ⓥ</f> And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
28-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the <f>ⓑ</f>officials of the tribes, the officers of the divisions that served the king, the <f>ⓒ</f>commanders of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, the <f>ⓓ</f>stewards of all the property and livestock of the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the <f>ⓔ</f>mighty men and all the seasoned warriors.
28-2 Then King David rose to his feet and said: “Hear me, my brothers and my people. <f>ⓕ</f>I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for the <f>ⓖ</f>footstool of our God, and I made preparations for building.
28-3 But God said to me, <f>ⓗ</f>‘You may not build a house for my name, for you are a man of war and have shed blood.’
28-4 Yet the LORD God of Israel <f>ⓘ</f>chose me from all my father's house to be king over Israel <f>ⓙ</f>forever. <f>ⓚ</f>For he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah my father's <f>ⓛ</f>house, and among my father's sons he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.
28-5 And of <f>ⓜ</f>all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons) he <f>ⓝ</f>has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
28-6 He said to me, ‘It is <f>ⓞ</f>Solomon your son who shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
28-7 I will establish his kingdom <f>ⓟ</f>forever <f>ⓠ</f>if he continues strong in keeping my commandments and my rules, as he is today.’
28-8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God, that you may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.
28-9 <pb/>“And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a <f>ⓡ</f>whole heart and with a willing mind, <f>ⓢ</f>for the LORD searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. <f>ⓣ</f>If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.
28-10 Be careful now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; <f>ⓤ</f>be strong and do it.”
28-11 <pb/>Then David gave Solomon his son the <f>ⓥ</f>plan of the <f>ⓦ</f>vestibule of the temple, <f>[1]</f> and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the <f>ⓧ</f>mercy seat;
28-12 and the plan of all that he had in mind for the courts of the house of the LORD, all the surrounding chambers, <f>ⓨ</f>the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for dedicated gifts;
28-13 for the <f>ⓩ</f>divisions of the priests and of the <f>ⓐ</f>Levites, and all the work of the service in the house of the LORD; for all the vessels for the service in the house of the LORD,
28-14 the weight of gold for all golden vessels for each service, the weight of silver vessels for each service,
28-15 the weight of the golden <f>ⓑ</f>lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, the weight of silver for a lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand in the service,
28-16 the weight of gold for each table for the showbread, the silver for the silver tables,
28-17 and pure gold for the forks, the basins and the cups; for the golden bowls and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each;
28-18 for the <f>ⓒ</f>altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his plan for the golden chariot of the <f>ⓓ</f>cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
28-19 “All this he made clear to me in writing from the hand of the LORD, <f>ⓔ</f>all the work to be done according to the plan.”
28-20 <pb/>Then David said to Solomon his son, <f>ⓕ</f>“Be strong and courageous and do it. Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for the LORD God, even my God, is with you. He will not leave you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of the LORD is finished.
28-21 And behold the <f>ⓖ</f>divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be <f>ⓗ</f>every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command.”
52-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Awake, awake, </t><t>put on your strength, O Zion; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>put on your beautiful garments, </t><t>O Jerusalem, <f>ⓒ</f>the holy city; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>for there shall no more come into you </t><t>the uncircumcised and the unclean.</t>
52-2 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Shake yourself from the dust and arise; </t><t>be seated, O Jerusalem; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>loose the bonds from your neck, </t><t>O captive daughter of Zion. </t>
52-3 <pb/>For thus says the LORD: <f>ⓖ</f>“You were sold for nothing, and <f>ⓗ</f>you shall be redeemed without money.”
52-4 For thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓘ</f>“My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there, and the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing. <f>[1]</f>
52-5 Now therefore what have I here,” declares the LORD, “seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Their rulers wail,” declares the LORD, “and <f>ⓙ</f>continually all the day my name is despised.
52-6 Therefore my people shall know my name. <f>ⓚ</f>Therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here I am.”
52-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> How beautiful upon the mountains </t><t>are the feet of him who brings good news, </t><t>who publishes peace, <f>ⓜ</f>who brings good news of happiness, </t><t>who publishes salvation, </t><t>who says to Zion, “Your God reigns.”</t>
52-8 <t>The voice of <f>ⓝ</f>your watchmen — they lift up their voice; </t><t>together they sing for joy; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>for eye to eye they see </t><t>the return of the LORD to Zion.</t>
52-9 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Break forth together into singing, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>you waste places of Jerusalem, </t><t>for <f>ⓡ</f>the LORD has comforted his people; </t><t>he has redeemed Jerusalem.</t>
52-10 <t><f>ⓢ</f> The LORD has bared his holy arm </t><t>before the eyes of all the nations, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>and all the ends of the earth shall see </t><t>the salvation of our God. </t>
52-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f> Depart, depart, go out from there; </t><t>touch no unclean thing; </t><t>go out from the midst of her; purify yourselves, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>you who bear the vessels of the LORD.</t>
52-12 <t>For you shall not <f>ⓦ</f>go out in haste, </t><t>and you shall not go in flight, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>for the LORD will go before you, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>and the God of Israel will be your rear guard. </t>
52-13 <pb/><t>Behold, <f>ⓩ</f>my servant shall act wisely; <f>[2]</f> </t><t>he shall be high and lifted up, </t><t>and shall be exalted.</t>
52-14 <t>As many were astonished at you — </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, </t><t>and his form beyond that of the children of mankind — </t>
52-15 <t>so <f>ⓑ</f>shall he sprinkle <f>[3]</f> many nations. </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>Kings shall shut their mouths because of him, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>for that which has not been told them they see, </t><t>and that which they have not heard they understand. </t>
5-1 <pb/>For <f>ⓐ</f>freedom Christ has <f>ⓑ</f>set us free; <f>ⓒ</f>stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to <f>ⓓ</f>a yoke of <f>ⓔ</f>slavery.
5-2 <pb/>Look: I, Paul, say to you that <f>ⓕ</f>if you accept circumcision, <f>ⓖ</f>Christ will be of no advantage to you.
5-3 I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that <f>ⓗ</f>he is obligated to keep the whole law.
5-4 You are <f>ⓘ</f>severed from Christ, <f>ⓙ</f>you who would be justified <f>[1]</f> by the law; <f>ⓚ</f>you have fallen away from grace.
5-5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly <f>ⓛ</f>wait for the hope of righteousness.
5-6 For in Christ Jesus <f>ⓜ</f>neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but <f>ⓝ</f>only faith working through love.
5-7 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying <f>ⓟ</f>the truth?
5-8 This persuasion is not from <f>ⓠ</f>him who calls you.
5-9 <f>ⓡ</f> A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
5-10 <f>ⓢ</f> I have confidence in the Lord that you will <f>ⓣ</f>take no other view, and <f>ⓤ</f>the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is.
5-11 But if I, brothers, <f>[2]</f> still preach <f>[3]</f> circumcision, <f>ⓥ</f>why am I still being persecuted? In that case <f>ⓦ</f>the offense of the cross has been removed.
5-12 I wish <f>ⓧ</f>those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!
5-13 <pb/>For you were called to freedom, brothers. <f>ⓨ</f>Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love <f>ⓩ</f>serve one another.
5-14 For <f>ⓐ</f>the whole law is fulfilled in one word: <f>ⓑ</f>“You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
5-15 But if you <f>ⓒ</f>bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
5-16 <pb/>But I say, <f>ⓓ</f>walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify <f>ⓔ</f>the desires of the flesh.
5-17 For <f>ⓕ</f>the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, <f>ⓖ</f>to keep you from doing the things you want to do.
5-18 But if you are <f>ⓗ</f>led by the Spirit, <f>ⓘ</f>you are not under the law.
5-19 Now <f>ⓙ</f>the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
5-20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, <f>ⓚ</f>divisions,
5-21 envy, <f>[4]</f> drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that <f>ⓛ</f>those who do <f>[5]</f> such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
5-22 But <f>ⓜ</f>the fruit of the Spirit is <f>ⓝ</f>love, joy, peace, patience, <f>ⓞ</f>kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
5-23 <f>ⓟ</f> gentleness, <f>ⓠ</f>self-control; <f>ⓡ</f>against such things there is no law.
5-24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus <f>ⓢ</f>have crucified the flesh with its <f>ⓣ</f>passions and desires.
5-25 <pb/>If we live by the Spirit, <f>ⓤ</f>let us also keep in step with the Spirit.
5-26 <f>ⓥ</f> Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
