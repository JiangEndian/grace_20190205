1 Chronicles 21-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then <f>ⓑ</f>Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
1 Chronicles 21-2 So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.”
1 Chronicles 21-3 But Joab said, “May the LORD add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel?”
1 Chronicles 21-4 But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 21-5 And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were <f>ⓒ</f>1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah <f>ⓓ</f>470,000 who drew the sword.
1 Chronicles 21-6 <f>ⓔ</f> But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab.
1 Chronicles 21-7 <pb/>But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel.
1 Chronicles 21-8 And David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please <f>ⓕ</f>take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
1 Chronicles 21-9 And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's <f>ⓖ</f>seer, saying,
1 Chronicles 21-10 “Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.’”
1 Chronicles 21-11 So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Choose what you will:
1 Chronicles 21-12 either <f>ⓗ</f>three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.”
1 Chronicles 21-13 Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”
1 Chronicles 21-14 <pb/>So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell.
1 Chronicles 21-15 And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw, and he <f>ⓘ</f>relented from the calamity. And he said to the angel who was working destruction, “It is enough; now stay your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles 21-16 And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, <f>ⓙ</f>clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
1 Chronicles 21-17 And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father's house. But do not let the plague be on your people.”
1 Chronicles 21-18 <pb/>Now <f>ⓚ</f>the angel of the LORD had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles 21-19 So David went up at Gad's word, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD.
1 Chronicles 21-20 Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
1 Chronicles 21-21 As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground.
1 Chronicles 21-22 And David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD — give it to me at its full price — that the plague may be averted from the people.”
1 Chronicles 21-23 Then Ornan said to David, “Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all.”
1 Chronicles 21-24 But King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”
1 Chronicles 21-25 So David paid Ornan <f>ⓛ</f>600 shekels <f>[1]</f> of gold by weight for the site.
1 Chronicles 21-26 And David built there an altar to the LORD and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the LORD, and the LORD <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓜ</f>answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.
1 Chronicles 21-27 Then the LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
1 Chronicles 21-28 <pb/>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
1 Chronicles 21-29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering <f>ⓝ</f>were at that time in the high place at Gibeon,
1 Chronicles 21-30 but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
Isaiah 45-1 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD to <f>ⓐ</f>his anointed, to Cyrus, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>whose right hand I have grasped, </t><t>to subdue nations before him </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>to loose the belts of kings, </t><t>to open doors before him </t><t>that gates may not be closed:</t>

Isaiah 45-10 <t>Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What are you begetting?’ </t><t>or to a woman, ‘With what are you in labor?’” </t>
Isaiah 45-11 <pb/><t>Thus says <f>ⓡ</f>the LORD, </t><t>the Holy One of Israel, and the one who formed him: </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>“Ask me of things to come; </t><t>will you command me <f>ⓣ</f>concerning my children and <f>ⓤ</f>the work of my hands? <f>[2]</f></t>
Isaiah 45-12 <t><f>ⓥ</f> I made the earth </t><t>and created man on it; </t><t>it was my hands <f>ⓦ</f>that stretched out the heavens, </t><t>and <f>ⓧ</f>I commanded all their host.</t>

Isaiah 45-15 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> Truly, you are a God who hides himself, </t><t>O God of Israel, the Savior.</t>

Isaiah 45-17 <t>But Israel is saved by the LORD </t><t>with everlasting salvation; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>you shall not be put to shame or confounded </t><t>to all eternity. </t>
Isaiah 45-18 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> For thus says the LORD, </t><t>who created the heavens </t><t>(he is God!), </t><t>who formed the earth and made it </t><t>(he established it; </t><t>he <f>ⓘ</f>did not create it empty, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>he formed it to be inhabited!): </t><t>“I am the LORD, and there is no other.</t>

2 Corinthians 11-1 <pb/>I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me!
2 Corinthians 11-2 For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since <f>ⓐ</f>I betrothed you to one husband, <f>ⓑ</f>to present you <f>ⓒ</f>as a pure virgin to Christ.
2 Corinthians 11-3 But I am afraid that <f>ⓓ</f>as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts <f>ⓔ</f>will be led astray from a <f>ⓕ</f>sincere and <f>ⓖ</f>pure devotion to Christ.
2 Corinthians 11-4 For if someone comes and <f>ⓗ</f>proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept <f>ⓘ</f>a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough.
2 Corinthians 11-5 Indeed, I consider that <f>ⓙ</f>I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles.
2 Corinthians 11-6 <f>ⓚ</f> Even if I am unskilled in speaking, <f>ⓛ</f>I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way <f>ⓜ</f>we have made this plain to you in all things.
2 Corinthians 11-7 <pb/>Or <f>ⓝ</f>did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because <f>ⓞ</f>I preached God's gospel to you free of charge?
2 Corinthians 11-8 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.
2 Corinthians 11-9 And when I was with you and was <f>ⓟ</f>in need, <f>ⓠ</f>I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia <f>ⓡ</f>supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain <f>ⓢ</f>from burdening you in any way.
2 Corinthians 11-10 <f>ⓣ</f> As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine <f>ⓤ</f>will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.
2 Corinthians 11-11 And why? <f>ⓥ</f>Because I do not love you? <f>ⓦ</f>God knows I do!
2 Corinthians 11-12 <pb/>And what I am doing I will continue to do, <f>ⓧ</f>in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do.
2 Corinthians 11-13 For such men are <f>ⓨ</f>false apostles, <f>ⓩ</f>deceitful workmen, <f>ⓐ</f>disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
2 Corinthians 11-14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as <f>ⓑ</f>an angel of light.
2 Corinthians 11-15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as <f>ⓒ</f>servants of righteousness. <f>ⓓ</f>Their end will correspond to their deeds.
2 Corinthians 11-16 <pb/>I repeat, <f>ⓔ</f>let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.
2 Corinthians 11-17 What I am saying <f>ⓕ</f>with this boastful confidence, <f>ⓖ</f>I say not as the Lord would <f>[1]</f> but as a fool.
2 Corinthians 11-18 Since <f>ⓗ</f>many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.
2 Corinthians 11-19 For you gladly bear with fools, <f>ⓘ</f>being wise yourselves!
2 Corinthians 11-20 For you bear it if someone <f>ⓙ</f>makes slaves of you, or <f>ⓚ</f>devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or <f>ⓛ</f>strikes you in the face.
2 Corinthians 11-21 To my shame, I must say, <f>ⓜ</f>we were too weak for that! <pb/>But whatever anyone else dares to boast of — I am speaking as a fool — I also dare to boast of that.
2 Corinthians 11-22 Are they Hebrews? <f>ⓝ</f>So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I.
2 Corinthians 11-23 Are they <f>ⓞ</f>servants of Christ? <f>ⓟ</f>I am a better one — I am talking like a madman — with far greater labors, <f>ⓠ</f>far more imprisonments, <f>ⓡ</f>with countless beatings, and <f>ⓢ</f>often near death.
2 Corinthians 11-24 Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the <f>ⓣ</f>forty lashes less one.
2 Corinthians 11-25 Three times I was <f>ⓤ</f>beaten with rods. <f>ⓥ</f>Once I was stoned. Three times I <f>ⓦ</f>was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea;
2 Corinthians 11-26 on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, <f>ⓧ</f>danger from my own people, <f>ⓨ</f>danger from Gentiles, <f>ⓩ</f>danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers;
2 Corinthians 11-27 <f>ⓐ</f> in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, <f>ⓑ</f>in hunger and thirst, often without food, <f>[2]</f> in cold and exposure.
2 Corinthians 11-28 And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for <f>ⓒ</f>all the churches.
2 Corinthians 11-29 <f>ⓓ</f> Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?
2 Corinthians 11-30 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
2 Corinthians 11-31 <f>ⓕ</f> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, <f>ⓖ</f>he who is blessed forever, <f>ⓗ</f>knows that I am not lying.
2 Corinthians 11-32 At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas <f>ⓘ</f>was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me,
2 Corinthians 11-33 <f>ⓙ</f> but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.
