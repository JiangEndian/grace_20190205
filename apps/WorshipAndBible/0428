Exodus 13-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses,
Exodus 13-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Consecrate to me all the firstborn. Whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and of beast, is mine.”
Exodus 13-3 <pb/>Then Moses said to the people, <f>ⓑ</f>“Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, <f>ⓒ</f>for by a strong hand the LORD brought you out from this place. <f>ⓓ</f>No leavened bread shall be eaten.
Exodus 13-4 Today, in the month of <f>ⓔ</f>Abib, you are going out.
Exodus 13-5 And when the LORD brings you into <f>ⓕ</f>the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which <f>ⓖ</f>he swore to your fathers to give you, a land <f>ⓗ</f>flowing with milk and honey, <f>ⓘ</f>you shall keep this service in this month.
Exodus 13-6 <f>ⓙ</f> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
Exodus 13-7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory.
Exodus 13-8 <f>ⓚ</f> You shall tell your son on that day, ‘It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’
Exodus 13-9 And it shall <f>ⓛ</f>be to you as a sign on your hand and as <f>ⓜ</f>a memorial <f>ⓝ</f>between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt.
Exodus 13-10 <f>ⓞ</f> You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
Exodus 13-11 <pb/>“When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, <f>ⓟ</f>as he swore to you and your fathers, and shall give it to you,
Exodus 13-12 <f>ⓠ</f> you shall set apart to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the firstborn of your animals that are males shall be the LORD's.
Exodus 13-13 <f>ⓡ</f> Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. Every <f>ⓢ</f>firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.
Exodus 13-14 <f>ⓣ</f> And when in time to come your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall say to him, <f>ⓤ</f>‘By a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of <f>ⓥ</f>slavery.
Exodus 13-15 For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the <f>ⓦ</f>LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all the males that first open the womb, but <f>ⓧ</f>all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’
Exodus 13-16 <f>ⓨ</f> It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes, for <f>ⓩ</f>by a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”
Exodus 13-17 <pb/>When Pharaoh let the people go, God did <f>ⓐ</f>not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, “Lest the people <f>ⓑ</f>change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.”
Exodus 13-18 But God <f>ⓒ</f>led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And the people of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt equipped for battle.
Exodus 13-19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph <f>[1]</f> had made the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, <f>ⓓ</f>“God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones with you from here.”
Exodus 13-20 And <f>ⓔ</f>they moved on from Succoth and encamped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus 13-21 And <f>ⓕ</f>the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.
Exodus 13-22 The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
Esther 2-1 <pb/>After these things, <f>ⓐ</f>when the anger of King Ahasuerus had abated, he remembered Vashti <f>ⓑ</f>and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.
Esther 2-2 Then the king's young men who attended him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king.
Esther 2-3 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the citadel, under custody of <f>ⓒ</f>Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women. <f>ⓓ</f>Let their cosmetics be given them.
Esther 2-4 And let the young woman who pleases the king <f>[1]</f> be queen instead of Vashti.” This pleased the king, and he did so.
Esther 2-5 <pb/>Now there was a Jew in Susa the citadel whose name was <f>ⓔ</f>Mordecai, the son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,
Esther 2-6 <f>ⓕ</f> who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away.
Esther 2-7 He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, <f>ⓖ</f>the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.
Esther 2-8 So when the king's order and his edict were proclaimed, and <f>ⓗ</f>when many young women were gathered in Susa the citadel in custody of <f>ⓘ</f>Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king's palace and put in custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.
Esther 2-9 And the young woman pleased him and won his favor. And he quickly provided her <f>ⓙ</f>with her cosmetics and her portion of food, and with seven chosen young women from the king's palace, and advanced her and her young women to the best place in the harem.
Esther 2-10 <f>ⓚ</f> Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known.
Esther 2-11 And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.
Esther 2-12 <pb/>Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women —
Esther 2-13 when the young woman went in to the king in this way, she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.
Esther 2-14 In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who was in charge of the concubines. She would not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.
Esther 2-15 <pb/>When the turn came for Esther <f>ⓛ</f>the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what <f>ⓜ</f>Hegai the king's eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her.
Esther 2-16 And when Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign,
Esther 2-17 the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set <f>ⓝ</f>the royal crown <f>[2]</f> on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
Esther 2-18 Then the king <f>ⓞ</f>gave a great feast for all his officials and servants; it was Esther's feast. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity.
Esther 2-19 <pb/>Now when the virgins were gathered together <f>ⓟ</f>the second time, Mordecai was sitting <f>ⓠ</f>at the king's gate.
Esther 2-20 <f>ⓡ</f> Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had commanded her, for Esther obeyed Mordecai just <f>ⓢ</f>as when she was brought up by him.
Esther 2-21 In those days, as Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, <f>ⓣ</f>Bigthan and <f>ⓤ</f>Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
Esther 2-22 And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai, <f>ⓥ</f>and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai.
Esther 2-23 When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows. <f>[3]</f> And it was recorded in <f>ⓦ</f>the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.

Jeremiah 48-6 <t>Flee! Save yourselves! </t><t>You will be like <f>ⓚ</f>a juniper in the desert!</t>
Jeremiah 48-7 <t>For, <f>ⓛ</f>because you trusted in your works and your treasures, </t><t>you also shall be taken; </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>Chemosh <f>ⓝ</f>shall go into exile </t><t>with <f>ⓞ</f>his priests and his officials.</t>

Jeremiah 48-12 <pb/>“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I shall send to him pourers who will pour him, and empty his vessels and break his <f>[3]</f> jars in pieces.

2 Peter 3-1 <pb/>This is now the second letter that I am writing to you, beloved. In both of them <f>ⓐ</f>I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,
2 Peter 3-2 <f>ⓑ</f> that you should remember the predictions of <f>ⓒ</f>the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles,
2 Peter 3-3 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come <f>ⓓ</f>in the last days with scoffing, <f>ⓔ</f>following their own sinful desires.
2 Peter 3-4 <f>ⓕ</f> They will say, “Where is the promise of <f>ⓖ</f>his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.”
2 Peter 3-5 For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth <f>ⓗ</f>was formed out of water and through water <f>ⓘ</f>by the word of God,
2 Peter 3-6 and that by means of these the world that then existed <f>ⓙ</f>was deluged with water and <f>ⓚ</f>perished.
2 Peter 3-7 But by the same word <f>ⓛ</f>the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and <f>ⓜ</f>destruction of the ungodly.
2 Peter 3-8 <pb/>But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and <f>ⓝ</f>a thousand years as one day.
2 Peter 3-9 <f>ⓞ</f> The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise <f>ⓟ</f>as some count slowness, but <f>ⓠ</f>is patient toward you, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>not wishing that any should perish, but <f>ⓢ</f>that all should reach repentance.
2 Peter 3-10 But <f>ⓣ</f>the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then <f>ⓤ</f>the heavens will pass away with a roar, and <f>ⓥ</f>the heavenly bodies <f>[2]</f> will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. <f>[3]</f>
2 Peter 3-11 <pb/>Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, <f>ⓦ</f>what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness,
2 Peter 3-12 <f>ⓧ</f> waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and <f>ⓨ</f>the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn!
2 Peter 3-13 But according to his promise we are waiting for <f>ⓩ</f>new heavens and a new earth <f>ⓐ</f>in which righteousness dwells.
2 Peter 3-14 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him <f>ⓒ</f>without spot or <f>ⓓ</f>blemish, and <f>ⓔ</f>at peace.
2 Peter 3-15 And count <f>ⓕ</f>the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as <f>ⓖ</f>our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you <f>ⓗ</f>according to the wisdom given him,
2 Peter 3-16 as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. <f>ⓘ</f>There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, <f>ⓙ</f>as they do the other Scriptures.
2 Peter 3-17 You therefore, beloved, <f>ⓚ</f>knowing this beforehand, <f>ⓛ</f>take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.
2 Peter 3-18 But <f>ⓜ</f>grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. <f>ⓝ</f>To him be the glory both now and to the day of <f>ⓞ</f>eternity. Amen.
