24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In his days, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him.
24-2 And the LORD sent against him bands of the <f>ⓑ</f>Chaldeans and <f>ⓒ</f>bands of the Syrians and bands of the Moabites and bands of the Ammonites, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, <f>ⓓ</f>according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by his servants the prophets.
24-3 Surely this came upon Judah at the command of the LORD, to remove them out of his sight, <f>ⓔ</f>for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done,
24-4 and also <f>ⓕ</f>for the innocent blood that he had shed. For he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD would not pardon.
24-5 <f>ⓖ</f> Now the rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
24-6 So Jehoiakim <f>ⓗ</f>slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
24-7 <f>ⓘ</f> And the king of Egypt did not come again out of his land, <f>ⓙ</f>for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt <f>ⓚ</f>from the Brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates.
24-8 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Jehoiachin was <f>ⓜ</f>eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
24-9 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>according to all that his father had done.
24-10 <pb/>At that time the servants of <f>ⓞ</f>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
24-11 And <f>ⓟ</f>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it,
24-12 <f>ⓠ</f> and Jehoiachin the king of Judah gave himself up to the king of Babylon, himself and his mother and his servants and his officials and his palace officials. <f>ⓡ</f>The king of Babylon took him prisoner <f>ⓢ</f>in the eighth year of his reign
24-13 and carried off all the treasures of the house of the LORD <f>ⓣ</f>and the treasures of the king's house, <f>ⓤ</f>and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold in the temple of the LORD, <f>ⓥ</f>which Solomon king of Israel had made, <f>ⓦ</f>as the LORD had foretold.
24-14 <f>ⓧ</f> He carried away all Jerusalem and all the officials and all the mighty men of valor, <f>ⓨ</f>10,000 captives, <f>ⓩ</f>and all the craftsmen and the smiths. None remained, <f>ⓐ</f>except the poorest people of the land.
24-15 <f>ⓑ</f> And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon. The king's mother, the king's wives, his officials, and the chief men of the land he took into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
24-16 And the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor, <f>ⓒ</f>7,000, and the craftsmen and the metal workers, 1,000, all of them strong and fit for war.
24-17 <f>ⓓ</f> And the king of Babylon <f>ⓔ</f>made Mattaniah, <f>ⓕ</f>Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place, <f>ⓖ</f>and changed his name to Zedekiah.
24-18 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was <f>ⓘ</f>Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
24-19 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, <f>ⓙ</f>according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
24-20 For because of the anger of the LORD it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. <pb/><f>ⓚ</f>And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
23-1 <pb/>The <f>ⓐ</f>oracle concerning <f>ⓑ</f>Tyre. <pb/><t>Wail, O <f>ⓒ</f>ships of Tarshish, </t><t>for Tyre is laid waste, <f>ⓓ</f>without house or harbor! </t><t>From <f>ⓔ</f>the land of Cyprus <f>[1]</f> </t><t>it is revealed to them.</t>
23-2 <t>Be still, O inhabitants of the coast; </t><t>the merchants of <f>ⓕ</f>Sidon, who cross the sea, have filled you.</t>
23-3 <t>And on many waters </t><t>your revenue was the grain of Shihor, </t><t>the harvest of the Nile; </t><t>you were <f>ⓖ</f>the merchant of the nations.</t>
23-4 <t>Be ashamed, O <f>ⓗ</f>Sidon, for the sea has spoken, </t><t>the stronghold of the sea, saying: </t><t>“I have neither labored nor given birth, </t><t>I have neither reared young men </t><t>nor brought up young women.”</t>
23-5 <t>When the report comes to Egypt, </t><t>they will be in anguish <f>[2]</f> over the report about Tyre.</t>
23-6 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Cross over to Tarshish; </t><t>wail, O inhabitants of the coast!</t>
23-7 <t>Is this your exultant city </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>whose origin is from days of old, </t><t>whose feet carried her </t><t>to settle far away?</t>
23-8 <t>Who has purposed this </t><t>against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, </t><t>whose merchants were princes, </t><t>whose traders were the honored of the earth?</t>
23-9 <t>The LORD of hosts has purposed it, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>to defile the pompous pride of all glory, <f>[3]</f> </t><t>to dishonor all the honored of the earth.</t>
23-10 <t>Cross over your land like the Nile, </t><t>O daughter of Tarshish; </t><t>there is no restraint anymore.</t>
23-11 <t><f>ⓛ</f> He has stretched out his hand over the sea; </t><t>he has shaken the kingdoms; </t><t>the LORD has given command concerning Canaan </t><t>to destroy its strongholds.</t>
23-12 <t>And he said: </t><t>“You will no more exult, </t><t>O oppressed virgin daughter of <f>ⓜ</f>Sidon; </t><t>arise, <f>ⓝ</f>cross over to <f>ⓞ</f>Cyprus, </t><t>even there you will have no rest.” </t>
23-13 <pb/>Behold the land of <f>ⓟ</f>the Chaldeans! This is the people that was not; <f>[4]</f> Assyria destined it for wild beasts. They erected <f>ⓠ</f>their siege towers, they stripped her palaces bare, they made her a ruin.
23-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f> Wail, O ships of Tarshish, </t><t>for your stronghold is laid waste. </t>
23-15 <pb/>In that day Tyre will be forgotten for <f>ⓢ</f>seventy years, like the days <f>[5]</f> of one king. At the end of <f>ⓣ</f>seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:
23-16 <pb/><t>“Take a harp; </t><t>go about the city, </t><t>O forgotten prostitute! </t><t>Make sweet melody; </t><t>sing many songs, </t><t>that you may be remembered.” </t>
23-17 <pb/>At the end of <f>ⓤ</f>seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and she will return to her wages and <f>ⓥ</f>will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
23-18 Her merchandise and her wages will be holy to the LORD. It will not be stored or hoarded, but her merchandise will supply abundant food and fine clothing for those who dwell before the LORD.
5-1 <pb/>It is actually reported that there is <f>ⓐ</f>sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, <f>ⓑ</f>for a man has his father's wife.
5-2 And <f>ⓒ</f>you are arrogant! Ought you <f>ⓓ</f>not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
5-3 <pb/>For though <f>ⓔ</f>absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing.
5-4 When you are assembled <f>ⓕ</f>in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
5-5 you are <f>ⓖ</f>to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so <f>ⓗ</f>that his spirit may be saved <f>ⓘ</f>in the day of the Lord. <f>[1]</f>
5-6 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that <f>ⓚ</f>a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
5-7 Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
5-8 Let us therefore celebrate the festival, <f>ⓛ</f>not with the old leaven, <f>ⓜ</f>the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
5-9 <pb/>I wrote to you in my letter <f>ⓝ</f>not to associate with sexually immoral people —
5-10 <f>ⓞ</f> not at all meaning <f>ⓟ</f>the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, <f>ⓠ</f>since then you would need to go out of the world.
5-11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone <f>ⓡ</f>who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler — not even to eat with such a one.
5-12 For what have I to do with judging <f>ⓢ</f>outsiders? <f>ⓣ</f>Is it not those inside the church <f>[2]</f> whom you are to judge?
5-13 God judges <f>[3]</f> those outside. <f>ⓤ</f>“Purge the evil person from among you.”
