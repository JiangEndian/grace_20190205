1 Samuel 6-1 <pb/>The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel 6-2 And the Philistines called for the priests and <f>ⓐ</f>the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place.”
1 Samuel 6-3 They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him <f>ⓑ</f>a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why <f>ⓒ</f>his hand does not turn away from you.”
1 Samuel 6-4 And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?” They answered, “Five golden <f>ⓓ</f>tumors and five golden mice, <f>ⓔ</f>according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords.
1 Samuel 6-5 So you must make images of your <f>ⓕ</f>tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, <f>ⓖ</f>and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps <f>ⓗ</f>he will lighten his hand from off you <f>ⓘ</f>and your gods and your land.
1 Samuel 6-6 Why should you harden your hearts as <f>ⓙ</f>the Egyptians and <f>ⓚ</f>Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them, <f>ⓛ</f>did they not send the people away, and they departed?
1 Samuel 6-7 Now then, take and prepare <f>ⓜ</f>a new cart and two milk cows <f>ⓝ</f>on which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them.
1 Samuel 6-8 And take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side <f>ⓞ</f>the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as <f>ⓟ</f>a guilt offering. Then send it off and let it go its way
1 Samuel 6-9 and watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land, to <f>ⓠ</f>Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it is not <f>ⓡ</f>his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence.”
1 Samuel 6-10 <pb/>The men did so, and took two milk cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home.
1 Samuel 6-11 And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors.
1 Samuel 6-12 And the cows went straight in the direction of <f>ⓢ</f>Beth-shemesh along <f>ⓣ</f>one highway, lowing as they went. They turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of <f>ⓤ</f>Beth-shemesh.
1 Samuel 6-13 Now the people of <f>ⓥ</f>Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it.
1 Samuel 6-14 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. <f>ⓦ</f>A great stone was there. And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
1 Samuel 6-15 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden figures, and set them upon <f>ⓧ</f>the great stone. And the men of <f>ⓨ</f>Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to the LORD.
1 Samuel 6-16 And when <f>ⓩ</f>the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.
1 Samuel 6-17 <pb/>These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a <f>ⓐ</f>guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron,
1 Samuel 6-18 and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, <f>ⓑ</f>both fortified cities and unwalled villages. <f>ⓒ</f>The great stone beside which they set down the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
1 Samuel 6-19 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> And he struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked upon the ark of the LORD. He struck seventy men of them, <f>[1]</f> and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great blow.
1 Samuel 6-20 Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, <f>ⓔ</f>“Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up away from us?”
1 Samuel 6-21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of <f>ⓕ</f>Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you.”
Psalm 129-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> “Greatly <f>[1]</f> have they <f>ⓑ</f>afflicted me <f>ⓒ</f>from my youth” — </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>let Israel now say — </t>
Psalm 129-2 <t>“Greatly have they <f>ⓔ</f>afflicted me <f>ⓕ</f>from my youth, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>yet they have not prevailed against me.</t>
Psalm 129-3 <t><f>ⓗ</f> The plowers plowed <f>ⓘ</f>upon my back; </t><t>they made long their furrows.”</t>
Psalm 129-4 <t>The LORD is righteous; </t><t>he has cut <f>ⓙ</f>the cords of the wicked.</t>
Psalm 129-5 <t>May all who hate Zion </t><t>be <f>ⓚ</f>put to shame and turned backward!</t>
Psalm 129-6 <t>Let them be like <f>ⓛ</f>the grass on the housetops, </t><t>which <f>ⓜ</f>withers before it grows up,</t>
Psalm 129-7 <t>with which the reaper does not fill his hand </t><t>nor the binder of sheaves his arms,</t>
Psalm 129-8 <t>nor do those who pass by say, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>“The blessing of the LORD be upon you! </t><t>We <f>ⓞ</f>bless you in the name of the LORD!” </t>
Mark 15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests <f>ⓑ</f>held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And <f>ⓒ</f>they bound Jesus and <f>ⓓ</f>led him away and <f>ⓔ</f>delivered him over to <f>ⓕ</f>Pilate.
Mark 15-2 <f>ⓖ</f> And Pilate asked him, <f>ⓗ</f>“Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“You have said so.”</J>
Mark 15-3 And the chief priests accused him of many things.
Mark 15-4 And Pilate again asked him, <f>ⓙ</f>“Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.”
Mark 15-5 But Jesus <f>ⓚ</f>made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.
Mark 15-6 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.
Mark 15-7 And among the rebels in prison, who had <f>ⓜ</f>committed murder <f>ⓝ</f>in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas.
Mark 15-8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them.
Mark 15-9 And he answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”
Mark 15-10 For he perceived that <f>ⓞ</f>it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.
Mark 15-11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.
Mark 15-12 And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with <f>ⓟ</f>the man you call the King of the Jews?”
Mark 15-13 And they cried out again, “Crucify him.”
Mark 15-14 And Pilate said to them, “Why? <f>ⓠ</f>What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.”
Mark 15-15 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having <f>ⓡ</f>scourged <f>[1]</f> Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
Mark 15-16 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> And the soldiers led him away inside <f>ⓣ</f>the palace (that is, <f>ⓤ</f>the governor's headquarters), <f>[2]</f> and they called together the whole <f>ⓥ</f>battalion. <f>[3]</f>
Mark 15-17 And they clothed him in <f>ⓦ</f>a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
Mark 15-18 And they began to salute him, <f>ⓧ</f>“Hail, King of the Jews!”
Mark 15-19 And they were striking his head with a reed and <f>ⓨ</f>spitting on him and <f>ⓩ</f>kneeling down in homage to him.
Mark 15-20 And when they had <f>ⓐ</f>mocked him, they stripped him of <f>ⓑ</f>the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they <f>ⓒ</f>led him out to crucify him.
Mark 15-21 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
Mark 15-22 <f>ⓔ</f> And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull).
Mark 15-23 And they offered him wine mixed with <f>ⓕ</f>myrrh, but he did not take it.
Mark 15-24 And they crucified him and <f>ⓖ</f>divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
Mark 15-25 And <f>ⓗ</f>it was the third hour <f>[4]</f> when they crucified him.
Mark 15-26 And the inscription of the charge against him read, <f>ⓘ</f>“The King of the Jews.”
Mark 15-27 And with him they crucified two <f>ⓙ</f>robbers, <f>ⓚ</f>one on his right and one on his left. <f>[5]</f>
Mark 15-28 
Mark 15-29 And <f>ⓛ</f>those who passed by derided him, <f>ⓜ</f>wagging their heads and saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“Aha! <f>ⓞ</f>You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
Mark 15-30 save yourself, and come down from the cross!”
Mark 15-31 So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, <f>ⓟ</f>“He saved others; <f>ⓠ</f>he cannot save himself.
Mark 15-32 Let <f>ⓡ</f>the Christ, <f>ⓢ</f>the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may <f>ⓣ</f>see and believe.” <f>ⓤ</f>Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.
Mark 15-33 <pb/>And when the sixth hour <f>[6]</f> had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. <f>[7]</f>
Mark 15-34 And at the ninth hour Jesus <f>ⓥ</f>cried with a loud voice, <J> <f>ⓦ</f>“Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?”</J> which means, <J>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</J>
Mark 15-35 And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”
Mark 15-36 And someone ran and filled a sponge with <f>ⓧ</f>sour wine, put it on a reed <f>ⓨ</f>and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.”
Mark 15-37 And Jesus <f>ⓩ</f>uttered a loud cry and <f>ⓐ</f>breathed his last.
Mark 15-38 And <f>ⓑ</f>the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
Mark 15-39 <f>ⓒ</f> And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he <f>[8]</f> breathed his last, he said, <f>ⓓ</f>“Truly this man was the Son <f>[9]</f> of God!”
Mark 15-40 <pb/>There were also <f>ⓔ</f>women looking on <f>ⓕ</f>from a distance, among whom were <f>ⓖ</f>Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and <f>ⓗ</f>Salome.
Mark 15-41 When he was in Galilee, they followed him and <f>ⓘ</f>ministered to him, and there were also many other women who <f>ⓙ</f>came up with him to Jerusalem.
Mark 15-42 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> And when evening had come, since it was <f>ⓛ</f>the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
Mark 15-43 Joseph of Arimathea, <f>ⓜ</f>a respected member of the council, who <f>ⓝ</f>was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mark 15-44 Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. <f>[10]</f> And summoning <f>ⓞ</f>the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
Mark 15-45 And when he learned from <f>ⓟ</f>the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
Mark 15-46 And Joseph <f>[11]</f> bought <f>ⓠ</f>a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and <f>ⓡ</f>laid him in a tomb <f>ⓢ</f>that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled <f>ⓣ</f>a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
Mark 15-47 <f>ⓤ</f> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
