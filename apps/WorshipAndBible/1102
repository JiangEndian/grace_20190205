1 Samuel 15-1 <pb/>And Samuel said to Saul, <f>ⓐ</f>“The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the LORD.
1 Samuel 15-2 Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘I have noted what Amalek did to Israel <f>ⓑ</f>in opposing them on the way when they came up out of Egypt.
1 Samuel 15-3 Now go and strike Amalek and <f>ⓒ</f>devote to destruction <f>[1]</f> all that they have. Do not spare them, <f>ⓓ</f>but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”
1 Samuel 15-4 <pb/>So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.
1 Samuel 15-5 And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.
1 Samuel 15-6 Then Saul said to <f>ⓔ</f>the Kenites, “Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. <f>ⓕ</f>For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
1 Samuel 15-7 <f>ⓖ</f> And Saul defeated the Amalekites from <f>ⓗ</f>Havilah as far as <f>ⓘ</f>Shur, which is east of Egypt.
1 Samuel 15-8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive <f>ⓙ</f>and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel 15-9 <f>ⓚ</f> But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves <f>[2]</f> and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.
1 Samuel 15-10 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to Samuel:
1 Samuel 15-11 <f>ⓛ</f> “I regret <f>[3]</f> that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and <f>ⓜ</f>has not performed my commandments.” And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the LORD all night.
1 Samuel 15-12 And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, “Saul came to <f>ⓝ</f>Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal.”
1 Samuel 15-13 And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, <f>ⓞ</f>“Blessed be you to the LORD. I have performed the commandment of the LORD.”
1 Samuel 15-14 And Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?”
1 Samuel 15-15 Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, <f>ⓟ</f>for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God, and the rest we have devoted to destruction.”
1 Samuel 15-16 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said to me this night.” And he said to him, “Speak.”
1 Samuel 15-17 <pb/>And Samuel said, <f>ⓠ</f>“Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.
1 Samuel 15-18 And the LORD sent you on a mission and said, ‘Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’
1 Samuel 15-19 Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? <f>ⓡ</f>Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?”
1 Samuel 15-20 And Saul said to Samuel, <f>ⓢ</f>“I have obeyed the voice of the LORD. I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me. I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have devoted the Amalekites to destruction.
1 Samuel 15-21 <f>ⓣ</f> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.”
1 Samuel 15-22 And Samuel said, <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, </t><t>as in obeying the voice of the LORD? </t><t>Behold, <f>ⓥ</f>to obey is better than sacrifice, </t><t>and to listen than the fat of rams.</t>
1 Samuel 15-23 <t>For rebellion is as the sin of divination, </t><t>and presumption is as iniquity and <f>ⓦ</f>idolatry. </t><t>Because <f>ⓧ</f>you have rejected the word of the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>he has also rejected you from being king.” </t>
1 Samuel 15-24 <pb/>Saul said to Samuel, <f>ⓩ</f>“I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
1 Samuel 15-25 Now therefore, please pardon my sin and <f>ⓐ</f>return with me that I may bow before the LORD.”
1 Samuel 15-26 And Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you. <f>ⓑ</f>For you have rejected the word of the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.”
1 Samuel 15-27 <f>ⓓ</f> As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore.
1 Samuel 15-28 And Samuel said to him, <f>ⓔ</f>“The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.
1 Samuel 15-29 And also the Glory of Israel <f>ⓕ</f>will not lie or have regret, for he is not a man, that he should have regret.”
1 Samuel 15-30 Then he said, “I have sinned; yet <f>ⓖ</f>honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>and return with me, that I may bow before the LORD your God.”
1 Samuel 15-31 So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed before the LORD.
1 Samuel 15-32 <pb/>Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. <f>[4]</f> Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”
1 Samuel 15-33 And Samuel said, <f>ⓘ</f>“As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD <f>ⓙ</f>in Gilgal.
1 Samuel 15-34 <pb/>Then Samuel went <f>ⓚ</f>to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in <f>ⓛ</f>Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel 15-35 <f>ⓜ</f> And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, <f>ⓝ</f>but Samuel grieved over Saul. <f>ⓞ</f>And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
Psalm 138-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> I give you thanks, O LORD, with my whole heart; </t><t>before <f>ⓑ</f>the gods I sing your praise;</t>
Psalm 138-2 <t>I bow down <f>ⓒ</f>toward your <f>ⓓ</f>holy temple </t><t>and give thanks to your name for your steadfast love and your faithfulness, </t><t>for you have exalted above all things </t><t>your name and your word. <f>[1]</f></t>
Psalm 138-3 <t>On the day I called, you answered me; </t><t>my strength of soul you increased. <f>[2]</f> </t>
Psalm 138-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> All the kings of the earth shall give you thanks, O LORD, </t><t>for they have heard the words of your mouth,</t>
Psalm 138-5 <t>and they shall sing of <f>ⓕ</f>the ways of the LORD, </t><t>for great is the glory of the LORD.</t>

Luke 8-1 <pb/>Soon afterward he went on <f>ⓐ</f>through cities and villages, proclaiming and <f>ⓑ</f>bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,
Luke 8-2 and also <f>ⓒ</f>some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: <f>ⓓ</f>Mary, called Magdalene, <f>ⓔ</f>from whom seven demons had gone out,
Luke 8-3 and <f>ⓕ</f>Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's household manager, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them <f>[1]</f> out of their means.
Luke 8-4 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable,
Luke 8-5 <J><f>ⓗ</f> “A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it.</J>
Luke 8-6 <J>And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, <f>ⓘ</f>it withered away, because it had no moisture.</J>
Luke 8-7 <J>And some fell among <f>ⓙ</f>thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</J>
Luke 8-8 <J>And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded <f>ⓚ</f>a hundredfold.”</J> As he said these things, he called out, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</J>
Luke 8-9 <pb/>And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant,
Luke 8-10 he said, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“To you it has been given to know <f>ⓝ</f>the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so <f>ⓞ</f>that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’</J>
Luke 8-11 <J><f>ⓟ</f> Now the parable is this: The seed is <f>ⓠ</f>the word of God.</J>
Luke 8-12 <J>The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not <f>ⓡ</f>believe and be saved.</J>
Luke 8-13 <J>And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it <f>ⓢ</f>with joy. But these have no root; they <f>ⓣ</f>believe for a while, and in time of testing <f>ⓤ</f>fall away.</J>
Luke 8-14 <J>And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but <f>ⓥ</f>as they go on their way they are choked by the <f>ⓦ</f>cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</J>
Luke 8-15 <J>As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and <f>ⓧ</f>bear fruit <f>ⓨ</f>with patience.</J>
Luke 8-16 <pb/><J><f>ⓩ</f> <f>ⓐ</f>“No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.</J>
Luke 8-17 <J><f>ⓑ</f> For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.</J>
Luke 8-18 <J><f>ⓒ</f> Take care then how you hear, <f>ⓓ</f>for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.”</J>
Luke 8-19 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Then his mother and <f>ⓕ</f>his brothers <f>[2]</f> came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.
Luke 8-20 And he was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.”
Luke 8-21 But he answered them, <J>“My mother and my brothers are those <f>ⓖ</f>who hear the word of God and do it.”</J>
Luke 8-22 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, <J>“Let us go across to the other side of <f>ⓘ</f>the lake.”</J> So they set out,
Luke 8-23 and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on <f>ⓙ</f>the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger.
Luke 8-24 And they went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And he awoke and <f>ⓚ</f>rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, <f>ⓛ</f>and there was a calm.
Luke 8-25 He said to them, <J>“Where is your faith?”</J> And they <f>ⓜ</f>were afraid, and they <f>ⓝ</f>marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that <f>ⓞ</f>he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?”
Luke 8-26 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, <f>[3]</f> which is opposite Galilee.
Luke 8-27 When Jesus <f>[4]</f> had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house <f>ⓠ</f>but among the tombs.
Luke 8-28 When he saw Jesus, he <f>ⓡ</f>cried out and fell down before him and said <f>ⓢ</f>with a loud voice, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, <f>ⓣ</f>Son of <f>ⓤ</f>the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”
Luke 8-29 For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon <f>ⓥ</f>into the desert.)
Luke 8-30 Jesus then asked him, <J>“What is your name?”</J> And he said, <f>ⓦ</f>“Legion,” for many demons had entered him.
Luke 8-31 And they begged him not to command them to depart into <f>ⓧ</f>the abyss.
Luke 8-32 Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission.
Luke 8-33 Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into <f>ⓨ</f>the lake and drowned.
Luke 8-34 <pb/>When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.
Luke 8-35 Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting <f>ⓩ</f>at the feet of Jesus, <f>ⓐ</f>clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
Luke 8-36 And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed <f>[5]</f> man had been healed.
Luke 8-37 Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes <f>ⓑ</f>asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.
Luke 8-38 The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
Luke 8-39 <J>“Return to your home, and <f>ⓒ</f>declare how much God has done for you.”</J> And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
Luke 8-40 <pb/>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd <f>ⓓ</f>welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
Luke 8-41 <f>ⓔ</f> And there came a man named Jairus, who was <f>ⓕ</f>a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus' feet, he implored him to come to his house,
Luke 8-42 for he had <f>ⓖ</f>an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. <pb/>As Jesus went, the people <f>ⓗ</f>pressed around him.
Luke 8-43 And there was a woman <f>ⓘ</f>who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her <f>ⓙ</f>living on physicians, <f>[6]</f> she could not be healed by anyone.
Luke 8-44 She came up behind him and touched <f>ⓚ</f>the fringe of his garment, and <f>ⓛ</f>immediately her discharge of blood ceased.
Luke 8-45 And Jesus said, <J>“Who was it that touched me?”</J> When all denied it, Peter <f>[7]</f> said, “Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!”
Luke 8-46 But Jesus said, <J>“Someone touched me, for I perceive that <f>ⓜ</f>power has gone out from me.”</J>
Luke 8-47 And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.
Luke 8-48 And he said to her, <J>“Daughter, <f>ⓝ</f>your faith has made you well; <f>ⓞ</f>go in peace.”</J>
Luke 8-49 <pb/>While he was still speaking, someone from <f>ⓟ</f>the ruler's house came and said, “Your daughter is dead; <f>ⓠ</f>do not trouble <f>ⓡ</f>the Teacher any more.”
Luke 8-50 But Jesus on hearing this answered him, <J>“Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.”</J>
Luke 8-51 And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except <f>ⓢ</f>Peter and <f>ⓣ</f>John and James, and the father and mother of the child.
Luke 8-52 And all were weeping and <f>ⓤ</f>mourning for her, but he <f>ⓥ</f>said, <J>“Do not weep, for <f>ⓦ</f>she is not dead but <f>ⓧ</f>sleeping.”</J>
Luke 8-53 And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
Luke 8-54 But <f>ⓨ</f>taking her by the hand he called, saying, <J>“Child, <f>ⓩ</f>arise.”</J>
Luke 8-55 And <f>ⓐ</f>her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat.
Luke 8-56 And her parents were amazed, but <f>ⓑ</f>he charged them to tell no one what had happened.
