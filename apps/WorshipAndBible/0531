Leviticus 6-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 6-2 “If anyone sins and <f>ⓐ</f>commits a breach of faith against the LORD by <f>ⓑ</f>deceiving his neighbor in <f>ⓒ</f>a matter of deposit or security, or through robbery, or <f>ⓓ</f>if he has oppressed his neighbor
Leviticus 6-3 or <f>ⓔ</f>has found something lost and lied about it, <f>ⓕ</f>swearing falsely — in any of all the things that people do and sin thereby —
Leviticus 6-4 if he has sinned and has realized his guilt and will restore <f>ⓖ</f>what he took by robbery or what he got by oppression or the deposit that was committed to him or the lost thing that he found
Leviticus 6-5 or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall <f>ⓗ</f>restore it in full and shall add a fifth to it, and give it to him to whom it belongs on the day he realizes his guilt.
Leviticus 6-6 And he shall bring to the priest as his compensation to the LORD <f>ⓘ</f>a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering.
Leviticus 6-7 <f>ⓙ</f> And the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he shall be forgiven for any of the things that one may do and thereby become guilty.”
Leviticus 6-8 <pb/><f>[2]</f> The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 6-9 “Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering. The burnt offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
Leviticus 6-10 And <f>ⓚ</f>the priest shall put on his linen garment and put his linen undergarment on his body, and he shall take up the ashes to which the fire has reduced the burnt offering on the altar and put them <f>ⓛ</f>beside the altar.
Leviticus 6-11 Then <f>ⓜ</f>he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes <f>ⓝ</f>outside the camp to a clean place.
Leviticus 6-12 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall arrange the burnt offering on it and shall burn on it <f>ⓞ</f>the fat of the peace offerings.
Leviticus 6-13 Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.
Leviticus 6-14 <pb/>“And this is the law of <f>ⓟ</f>the grain offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD in front of the altar.
Leviticus 6-15 And one shall take from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering and its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering and burn this as its <f>ⓠ</f>memorial portion on the altar, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus 6-16 And <f>ⓡ</f>the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten unleavened <f>ⓢ</f>in a holy place. In the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
Leviticus 6-17 <f>ⓣ</f> It shall not be baked with leaven. <f>ⓤ</f>I have given it as their portion of my food offerings. <f>ⓥ</f>It is a thing most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.
Leviticus 6-18 Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as decreed forever throughout your generations, from the LORD's food offerings. Whatever touches them shall become holy.”
Leviticus 6-19 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 6-20 <f>ⓦ</f> “This is the offering that Aaron and his sons shall offer to the LORD on the day when he is anointed: a <f>ⓧ</f>tenth of an ephah <f>[3]</f> of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.
Leviticus 6-21 It shall be made with oil <f>ⓨ</f>on a griddle. You shall bring it <f>ⓩ</f>well mixed, in baked <f>[4]</f> pieces like a grain offering, and offer it for a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
Leviticus 6-22 The priest from among Aaron's sons, who is anointed to succeed him, shall offer it to the LORD as decreed forever. <f>ⓐ</f>The whole of it shall be burned.
Leviticus 6-23 Every grain offering of a priest shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.”
Leviticus 6-24 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 6-25 “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, <f>ⓑ</f>This is the law of the sin offering. <f>ⓒ</f>In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD; <f>ⓓ</f>it is most holy.
Leviticus 6-26 <f>ⓔ</f> The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. <f>ⓕ</f>In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus 6-27 Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy, and when any of its blood is splashed on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was splashed in a holy place.
Leviticus 6-28 And <f>ⓖ</f>the earthenware vessel in which it is boiled <f>ⓗ</f>shall be broken. But if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, that shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
Leviticus 6-29 Every male among the priests may eat of it; <f>ⓘ</f>it is most holy.
Leviticus 6-30 <f>ⓙ</f> But no sin offering shall be eaten from which any blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place; it shall be burned up with fire.
Job 25-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Job 25-2 <pb/><t>“Dominion and fear are with God; <f>[1]</f> </t><t>he makes peace in his high heaven.</t>
Job 25-3 <t>Is there any number to his <f>ⓑ</f>armies? </t><t>Upon whom does his <f>ⓒ</f>light not arise?</t>
Job 25-4 <t>How then can man be <f>ⓓ</f>in the right before God? </t><t>How can he who is <f>ⓔ</f>born of woman be <f>ⓕ</f>pure?</t>
Job 25-5 <t>Behold, even the moon is not bright, </t><t>and the stars are not pure in his eyes;</t>
Job 25-6 <t><f>ⓖ</f> how much less man, who is <f>ⓗ</f>a maggot, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>the son of man, who is a worm!” </t>
Ezekiel 24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 24-2 <f>ⓑ</f> “Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
Ezekiel 24-3 And <f>ⓒ</f>utter a parable to <f>ⓓ</f>the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t>“Set on <f>ⓔ</f>the pot, set it on; </t><t>pour in water also;</t>
Ezekiel 24-4 <t>put in it the pieces of meat, </t><t>all the good pieces, <f>ⓕ</f>the thigh and the shoulder; </t><t>fill it with choice bones.</t>
Ezekiel 24-5 <t>Take the choicest one of the flock; </t><t>pile the logs <f>[1]</f> under it; </t><t>boil it well; </t><t>seethe also its bones in it. </t>
Ezekiel 24-6 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓖ</f>Woe to the bloody city, to <f>ⓗ</f>the pot whose corrosion is in it, and whose corrosion has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, without making any choice. <f>[2]</f>
Ezekiel 24-7 For the blood she has shed is in her midst; she put it on <f>ⓘ</f>the bare rock; <f>ⓙ</f>she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust.
Ezekiel 24-8 To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered.
Ezekiel 24-9 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city! <f>ⓚ</f>I also will make the pile great.
Ezekiel 24-10 Heap on the logs, kindle the fire, boil the meat well, mix in the spices, <f>[3]</f> and let the bones be burned up.
Ezekiel 24-11 Then set it empty upon the coals, that it may become hot, and its copper may burn, <f>ⓛ</f>that its uncleanness may be melted in it, its corrosion consumed.
Ezekiel 24-12 <f>ⓜ</f> She has wearied herself with toil; <f>[4]</f> its abundant corrosion does not go out of it. Into the fire with its corrosion!
Ezekiel 24-13 On account of your unclean lewdness, because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your uncleanness, <f>ⓝ</f>you shall not be cleansed anymore till <f>ⓞ</f>I have satisfied my fury upon you.
Ezekiel 24-14 <f>ⓟ</f> I am the LORD. I have spoken; it shall come to pass; I will do it. I will not go back; <f>ⓠ</f>I will not spare; <f>ⓡ</f>I will not relent; <f>ⓢ</f>according to your ways and your deeds you will be judged, declares the Lord GOD.”
Ezekiel 24-15 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 24-16 <f>ⓣ</f> “Son of man, behold, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down.
Ezekiel 24-17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. <f>ⓤ</f>Bind on your turban, and <f>ⓥ</f>put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, <f>ⓦ</f>nor eat the bread of men.”
Ezekiel 24-18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and <f>ⓧ</f>at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did <f>ⓨ</f>as I was commanded.
Ezekiel 24-19 <pb/>And <f>ⓩ</f>the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting thus?”
Ezekiel 24-20 Then I said to them, “The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 24-21 ‘Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓐ</f>Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and <f>ⓑ</f>your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.
Ezekiel 24-22 And <f>ⓒ</f>you shall do as I have done; <f>ⓓ</f>you shall not cover your lips, <f>ⓔ</f>nor eat the bread of men.
Ezekiel 24-23 <f>ⓕ</f> Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but <f>ⓖ</f>you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan to one another.
Ezekiel 24-24 Thus shall Ezekiel be to you <f>ⓗ</f>a sign; <f>ⓘ</f>according to all that he has done you shall do. When this comes, then <f>ⓙ</f>you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’
Ezekiel 24-25 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓚ</f>son of man, surely on the day when I take from them <f>ⓛ</f>their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their soul's desire, and also their sons and daughters,
Ezekiel 24-26 <f>ⓜ</f> on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news.
Ezekiel 24-27 On that day your mouth <f>ⓝ</f>will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer mute. <f>ⓞ</f>So you will be a sign to them, and <f>ⓟ</f>they will know that I am the LORD.”
