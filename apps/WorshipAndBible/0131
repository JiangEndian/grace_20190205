3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> These are the sons of David who were born to him in Hebron: the firstborn, Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelite; the second, <f>ⓑ</f>Daniel, by Abigail the Carmelite,
3-2 the third, Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; the fourth, Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith;
3-3 the fifth, Shephatiah, by Abital; the sixth, Ithream, by his wife Eglah;
3-4 six were born to him in Hebron, <f>ⓒ</f>where he reigned for seven years and six months. <f>ⓓ</f>And he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
3-5 <f>ⓔ</f> These were born to him in Jerusalem: <f>ⓕ</f>Shimea, Shobab, Nathan and <f>ⓖ</f>Solomon, four by <f>ⓗ</f>Bath-shua, the daughter of <f>ⓘ</f>Ammiel;
3-6 then Ibhar, <f>ⓙ</f>Elishama, Eliphelet,
3-7 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
3-8 Elishama, <f>ⓚ</f>Eliada, and Eliphelet, nine.
3-9 All these were David's sons, besides the sons of the concubines, <f>ⓛ</f>and Tamar was their sister.
3-10 <pb/>The son of Solomon was <f>ⓜ</f>Rehoboam, <f>ⓝ</f>Abijah his son, <f>ⓞ</f>Asa his son, <f>ⓟ</f>Jehoshaphat his son,
3-11 <f>ⓠ</f> Joram his son, <f>ⓡ</f>Ahaziah his son, <f>ⓢ</f>Joash his son,
3-12 <f>ⓣ</f> Amaziah his son, <f>ⓤ</f>Azariah his son, <f>ⓥ</f>Jotham his son,
3-13 <f>ⓦ</f> Ahaz his son, <f>ⓧ</f>Hezekiah his son, <f>ⓨ</f>Manasseh his son,
3-14 <f>ⓩ</f> Amon his son, <f>ⓐ</f>Josiah his son.
3-15 The sons of Josiah: <f>ⓑ</f>Johanan the firstborn, the second <f>ⓒ</f>Jehoiakim, the third <f>ⓓ</f>Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.
3-16 The descendants of <f>ⓔ</f>Jehoiakim: <f>ⓕ</f>Jeconiah his son, <f>ⓖ</f>Zedekiah his son;
3-17 and the sons of Jeconiah, the <f>ⓗ</f>captive: <f>ⓘ</f>Shealtiel his son,
3-18 Malchiram, Pedaiah, Shenazzar, Jekamiah, Hoshama and Nedabiah;
3-19 and the sons of Pedaiah: <f>ⓙ</f>Zerubbabel and Shimei; and the sons of <f>ⓚ</f>Zerubbabel: Meshullam and Hananiah, and Shelomith was their sister;

27-1 <pb/>In that day the LORD with his hard and great and strong <f>ⓐ</f>sword will punish <f>ⓑ</f>Leviathan the fleeing serpent, <f>ⓒ</f>Leviathan the twisting serpent, and he will slay <f>ⓓ</f>the dragon that is in the sea.
27-2 <pb/><t>In that day, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>“A pleasant vineyard, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>sing of it!</t>
27-3 <t>I, the LORD, am its keeper; </t><t>every moment I water it. </t><t>Lest anyone punish it, </t><t>I keep it night and day;</t>
27-4 <t>I have no wrath. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>Would that I had thorns and briers to battle! </t><t>I would march against them, </t><t>I would burn them up together.</t>
27-5 <t>Or let them lay hold of my protection, </t><t>let them make peace with me, </t><t>let them make peace with me.” </t>
27-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> In days to come <f>[2]</f> Jacob shall take root, </t><t>Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots </t><t>and fill the whole world with fruit. </t>
27-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Has he struck them <f>ⓙ</f>as he struck those who struck them? </t><t>Or have they been slain <f>ⓚ</f>as their slayers were slain?</t>
27-8 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Measure by measure, <f>[3]</f> by exile you contended with them; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>he removed them with his fierce breath <f>[4]</f> in the day of the east wind.</t>
27-9 <t>Therefore by this <f>ⓝ</f>the guilt of Jacob will be atoned for, </t><t>and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: <f>[5]</f> </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>when he makes all the stones of the altars </t><t>like chalkstones crushed to pieces, </t><t>no <f>ⓟ</f>Asherim or incense altars will remain standing.</t>
27-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> For the fortified city is solitary, </t><t>a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness; </t><t>there the calf grazes; </t><t>there it lies down and strips its branches.</t>
27-11 <t>When its boughs are dry, they are broken; </t><t>women come and make a fire of them. </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>For this is a people without discernment; </t><t>therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them; </t><t>he who formed them will show them no favor. </t>
27-12 <pb/>In that day <f>ⓢ</f>from the river Euphrates <f>[6]</f> to the Brook of Egypt the LORD will thresh out the grain, and you will be gleaned one by one, O people of Israel.
27-13 And in that day <f>ⓣ</f>a great trumpet will be blown, <f>ⓤ</f>and those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt <f>ⓥ</f>will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
9-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Am I not free? <f>ⓑ</f>Am I not an apostle? <f>ⓒ</f>Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? <f>ⓓ</f>Are not you my workmanship in the Lord?
9-2 If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you, for you are <f>ⓔ</f>the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
9-3 <pb/>This is my defense to those who would examine me.
9-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
9-5 <f>ⓖ</f> Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, <f>[1]</f> as do the other apostles and <f>ⓗ</f>the brothers of the Lord and <f>ⓘ</f>Cephas?
9-6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?
9-7 <f>ⓙ</f> Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? <f>ⓚ</f>Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
9-8 <pb/>Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same?
9-9 For it is written in the Law of Moses, <f>ⓛ</f>“You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
9-10 Does he not certainly speak for our sake? It was written <f>ⓜ</f>for our sake, because <f>ⓝ</f>the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.
9-11 <f>ⓞ</f> If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
9-12 If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more? <pb/>Nevertheless, <f>ⓟ</f>we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything <f>ⓠ</f>rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.
9-13 Do you not know that <f>ⓡ</f>those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings?
9-14 In the same way, the Lord commanded that <f>ⓢ</f>those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
9-15 <pb/>But <f>ⓣ</f>I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone <f>ⓤ</f>deprive me of my ground for boasting.
9-16 For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For <f>ⓥ</f>necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
9-17 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with <f>ⓦ</f>a stewardship.
9-18 What then is my reward? That in my preaching <f>ⓧ</f>I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
9-19 <pb/>For <f>ⓨ</f>though I am free from all, <f>ⓩ</f>I have made myself a servant to all, that I might <f>ⓐ</f>win more of them.
9-20 <f>ⓑ</f> To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law.
9-21 To <f>ⓒ</f>those outside the law I became <f>ⓓ</f>as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but <f>ⓔ</f>under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.
9-22 <f>ⓕ</f> To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. <f>ⓖ</f>I have become all things to all people, that <f>ⓗ</f>by all means I might save some.
9-23 I do it all for the sake of the gospel, <f>ⓘ</f>that I may share with them in its blessings.
9-24 <pb/>Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives <f>ⓙ</f>the prize? So <f>ⓚ</f>run that you may obtain it.
9-25 Every <f>ⓛ</f>athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we <f>ⓜ</f>an imperishable.
9-26 So I do not run aimlessly; I <f>ⓝ</f>do not box as one <f>ⓞ</f>beating the air.
9-27 But I discipline my body and <f>ⓟ</f>keep it under control, <f>[2]</f> lest after preaching to others <f>ⓠ</f>I myself should be <f>ⓡ</f>disqualified.
