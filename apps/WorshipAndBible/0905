6-1 <pb/>Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel. None went out, and none came in.
6-2 And the LORD said to Joshua, “See, <f>ⓐ</f>I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and mighty men of valor.
6-3 You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days.
6-4 Seven priests shall bear seven <f>ⓑ</f>trumpets of <f>ⓒ</f>rams' horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and <f>ⓓ</f>the priests shall blow the trumpets.
6-5 And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat, <f>[1]</f> and the people shall go up, everyone straight before him.”
6-6 So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.”
6-7 And he said to the people, “Go forward. March around the city and let <f>ⓔ</f>the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD.”
6-8 <pb/>And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them.
6-9 The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the <f>ⓕ</f>rear guard was walking after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually.
6-10 But Joshua commanded the people, “You shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.”
6-11 So he caused the ark of the LORD to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.
6-12 <pb/>Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and <f>ⓖ</f>the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
6-13 And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD walked on, and they blew the trumpets continually. And the armed men were walking before them, and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually.
6-14 And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.
6-15 <pb/>On the seventh day they rose early, at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.
6-16 And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for the LORD has given you the city.
6-17 And the city and all that is within it shall be <f>ⓗ</f>devoted to the LORD for destruction. <f>[2]</f> Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she <f>ⓘ</f>hid the messengers whom we sent.
6-18 But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel <f>ⓙ</f>a thing for destruction and <f>ⓚ</f>bring trouble upon it.
6-19 But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.”
6-20 So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and <f>ⓛ</f>the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.
6-21 Then they <f>ⓜ</f>devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword.
6-22 <pb/>But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, “Go into the prostitute's house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, <f>ⓝ</f>as you swore to her.”
6-23 So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab and <f>ⓞ</f>her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. And they brought all her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel.
6-24 And they burned the city with fire, and everything in it. <f>ⓟ</f>Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
6-25 But Rahab the prostitute and her father's household and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive. And <f>ⓠ</f>she has lived in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
6-26 <pb/>Joshua laid an oath on them at that time, saying, <f>ⓡ</f>“Cursed before the LORD be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho. <pb/><t>“At the cost of his firstborn shall he </t><t>lay its foundation, </t><t>and at the cost of his youngest son </t><t>shall he set up its gates.” </t>
6-27 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> So the LORD was with Joshua, and <f>ⓣ</f>his fame was in all the land.
80-1 <f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f> <pb/><t>Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, </t><t>you who lead <f>ⓒ</f>Joseph like <f>ⓓ</f>a flock. </t><t>You who are <f>ⓔ</f>enthroned upon the cherubim, <f>ⓕ</f>shine forth.</t>
80-2 <t>Before <f>ⓖ</f>Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>stir up your might </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>come to save us! </t>
80-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Restore us, <f>[1]</f> O God; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>let your face shine, that we may be saved! </t>
80-4 <pb/><t>O <f>ⓛ</f>LORD God of hosts, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>how long will you be angry with your people's prayers?</t>
80-5 <t>You have fed them with <f>ⓝ</f>the bread of tears </t><t>and given them tears to drink in full measure.</t>
80-6 <t><f>ⓞ</f> You make us an object of contention for our <f>ⓟ</f>neighbors, </t><t>and our enemies laugh among themselves. </t>
80-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> Restore us, O God of hosts; </t><t>let your face shine, that we may be saved! </t>
80-8 <pb/><t>You brought <f>ⓡ</f>a vine out of Egypt; </t><t>you <f>ⓢ</f>drove out the nations and planted it.</t>
80-9 <t>You <f>ⓣ</f>cleared the ground for it; </t><t>it took deep root and filled the land.</t>
80-10 <t>The mountains were covered with its shade, </t><t>the mighty cedars with its branches.</t>
80-11 <t>It sent out its branches to <f>ⓤ</f>the sea </t><t>and its shoots to <f>ⓥ</f>the River. <f>[2]</f></t>
80-12 <t>Why then have you <f>ⓦ</f>broken down its walls, </t><t>so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?</t>
80-13 <t><f>ⓧ</f> The boar from the forest ravages it, </t><t>and all that move in the field feed on it. </t>
80-14 <pb/><t>Turn again, O God of hosts! </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>Look down from heaven, and see; </t><t>have regard for this vine,</t>
80-15 <t>the stock that your right hand planted, </t><t>and for the son whom you made strong for yourself.</t>
80-16 <t>They have <f>ⓩ</f>burned it with fire; they have <f>ⓐ</f>cut it down; </t><t>may they perish at <f>ⓑ</f>the rebuke of your face!</t>
80-17 <t>But <f>ⓒ</f>let your hand be on the man of your right hand, </t><t>the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!</t>
80-18 <t>Then we shall not turn back from you; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>give us life, and we will call upon your name! </t>
80-19 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! </t><t>Let your face shine, that we may be saved! </t>
12-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The oracle of the word of the LORD concerning Israel: Thus declares the LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>who stretched out the heavens and <f>ⓒ</f>founded the earth and <f>ⓓ</f>formed the spirit of man within him:
12-2 “Behold, I am about to make Jerusalem <f>ⓔ</f>a cup of staggering to <f>ⓕ</f>all the surrounding peoples. The siege of Jerusalem <f>ⓖ</f>will also be against Judah.
12-3 <f>ⓗ</f> On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. <f>ⓘ</f>All who lift it will surely hurt themselves. And <f>ⓙ</f>all the nations of the earth will gather against it.
12-4 <f>ⓚ</f> On that day, declares the LORD, <f>ⓛ</f>I will strike every horse <f>ⓜ</f>with panic, and its rider <f>ⓝ</f>with madness. But for the sake of the house of Judah I will keep my eyes open, when I strike every horse of the peoples <f>ⓞ</f>with blindness.
12-5 Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the LORD of hosts, their God.’
12-6 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> “On that day I will make the clans of Judah <f>ⓠ</f>like a blazing pot in the midst of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves. And <f>ⓡ</f>they shall devour to the right and to the left all the surrounding peoples, while <f>ⓢ</f>Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem.
12-7 <pb/>“And the LORD will give salvation to the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not surpass that of Judah.
12-8 <f>ⓣ</f> On that day <f>ⓤ</f>the LORD will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that <f>ⓥ</f>the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, <f>ⓦ</f>like the angel of the LORD, going before them.
12-9 <f>ⓧ</f> And on that day <f>ⓨ</f>I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
12-10 <pb/>“And <f>ⓩ</f>I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and <f>ⓐ</f>pleas for mercy, so that, <f>ⓑ</f>when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, <f>ⓒ</f>they shall mourn for him, <f>ⓓ</f>as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn.
12-11 <f>ⓔ</f> On that day <f>ⓕ</f>the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great <f>ⓖ</f>as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
12-12 The land shall mourn, <f>ⓗ</f>each family <f>[1]</f> by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of <f>ⓘ</f>Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
12-13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of <f>ⓙ</f>the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;
12-14 and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves.
