Ezekiel 20-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of <f>ⓑ</f>the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>and sat before me.
Ezekiel 20-2 And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 20-3 <f>ⓓ</f> “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD, Is it to inquire of me that you come? <f>ⓔ</f>As I live, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓕ</f>I will not be inquired of by you.
Ezekiel 20-4 <f>ⓖ</f> Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? <f>ⓗ</f>Let them know the abominations of their fathers,
Ezekiel 20-5 and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓘ</f>On the day when I chose Israel, <f>ⓙ</f>I swore <f>[1]</f> to the offspring of the house of Jacob, <f>ⓚ</f>making myself known to them in the land of Egypt; <f>ⓛ</f>I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.
Ezekiel 20-6 On that day I swore to them that <f>ⓜ</f>I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land <f>ⓝ</f>flowing with milk and honey, <f>ⓞ</f>the most glorious of all lands.
Ezekiel 20-7 And I said to them, <f>ⓟ</f>‘Cast away the detestable things <f>ⓠ</f>your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with <f>ⓡ</f>the idols of Egypt; <f>ⓢ</f>I am the LORD your God.’
Ezekiel 20-8 <f>ⓣ</f> But they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me. <f>ⓤ</f>None of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. <pb/>“Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them <f>ⓥ</f>and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel 20-9 <f>ⓦ</f> But I acted <f>ⓧ</f>for the sake of my name, <f>ⓨ</f>that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, <f>ⓩ</f>in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel 20-10 <f>ⓐ</f> So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel 20-11 <f>ⓑ</f> I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules, <f>ⓒ</f>by which, if a person does them, he shall live.
Ezekiel 20-12 Moreover, I gave them <f>ⓓ</f>my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, <f>ⓔ</f>that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
Ezekiel 20-13 <f>ⓕ</f> But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. <f>ⓖ</f>They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; <f>ⓗ</f>and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned. <pb/><f>ⓘ</f>“Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them.
Ezekiel 20-14 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, <f>ⓙ</f>in whose sight I had brought them out.
Ezekiel 20-15 Moreover, <f>ⓚ</f>I swore to them in the wilderness <f>ⓛ</f>that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land <f>ⓜ</f>flowing with milk and honey, <f>ⓝ</f>the most glorious of all lands,
Ezekiel 20-16 because they rejected my rules and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; <f>ⓞ</f>for their heart went after their idols.
Ezekiel 20-17 Nevertheless, <f>ⓟ</f>my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or <f>ⓠ</f>make a full end of them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel 20-18 <pb/>“And I said to <f>ⓡ</f>their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk <f>ⓢ</f>in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their rules, <f>ⓣ</f>nor defile yourselves with their idols.

Ezekiel 20-21 <f>ⓨ</f> But the children <f>ⓩ</f>rebelled against me. <f>ⓐ</f>They did not walk in my statutes and were not careful to obey my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; they profaned my Sabbaths. <pb/><f>ⓑ</f>“Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel 20-22 <f>ⓒ</f> But I withheld my hand <f>ⓓ</f>and acted for the sake of my name, <f>ⓔ</f>that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
Ezekiel 20-23 <f>ⓕ</f> Moreover, <f>ⓖ</f>I swore to them in the wilderness <f>ⓗ</f>that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,
Ezekiel 20-24 because they had not obeyed my rules, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, <f>ⓘ</f>and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols.
Ezekiel 20-25 <f>ⓙ</f> Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and rules by which they could not have life,
Ezekiel 20-26 and I defiled them through <f>ⓚ</f>their very gifts <f>ⓛ</f>in their offering up all their firstborn, that I might devastate them. I did it <f>ⓜ</f>that they might know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 20-27 <pb/>“Therefore, <f>ⓝ</f>son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this also your fathers blasphemed me, by <f>ⓞ</f>dealing treacherously with me.
Ezekiel 20-28 For when I had brought them into the land that <f>ⓟ</f>I swore to give them, then wherever they saw <f>ⓠ</f>any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and there they presented <f>ⓡ</f>the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their pleasing aromas, and there they poured out their drink offerings.
Ezekiel 20-29 (I said to them, <f>ⓢ</f>‘What is the high place to which you go?’ So its name is called Bamah <f>[2]</f> to this day.)
Ezekiel 20-30 <pb/>“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓣ</f>Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go <f>ⓤ</f>whoring after their detestable things?

Ezekiel 20-38 <f>ⓚ</f> I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me. <f>ⓛ</f>I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, <f>ⓜ</f>but they shall not enter the land of Israel. <f>ⓝ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 20-39 <pb/>“As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓞ</f>Go serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; <f>ⓟ</f>but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.

Ezekiel 20-45 <pb/><f>[4]</f> And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 20-46 <f>ⓑ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓒ</f>set your face toward the southland; <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb.

Ezekiel 20-48 <f>ⓘ</f> All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.”
Ezekiel 20-49 Then I said, <f>ⓙ</f>“Ah, Lord GOD! They are saying of me, <f>ⓚ</f>‘Is he not a maker of parables?’”
Revelation 21-1 <pb/>Then I saw <f>ⓐ</f>a new heaven and a new earth, for <f>ⓑ</f>the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
Revelation 21-2 And I saw <f>ⓒ</f>the holy city, <f>ⓓ</f>new Jerusalem, <f>ⓔ</f>coming down out of heaven from God, <f>ⓕ</f>prepared <f>ⓖ</f>as a bride adorned for her husband.
Revelation 21-3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, <f>ⓗ</f>the dwelling place <f>[1]</f> of God is with man. He will <f>ⓘ</f>dwell with them, and they will be his people, <f>[2]</f> and God himself will be with them as their God. <f>[3]</f>
Revelation 21-4 <f>ⓙ</f> He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and <f>ⓚ</f>death shall be no more, <f>ⓛ</f>neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”
Revelation 21-5 <pb/>And <f>ⓜ</f>he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I <f>ⓝ</f>am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for <f>ⓞ</f>these words are trustworthy and true.”
Revelation 21-6 And he said to me, <f>ⓟ</f>“It is done! <f>ⓠ</f>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. <f>ⓡ</f>To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.
Revelation 21-7 <f>ⓢ</f> The one who conquers will have this heritage, and <f>ⓣ</f>I will be his God and <f>ⓤ</f>he will be my son.
Revelation 21-8 <f>ⓥ</f> But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, <f>ⓦ</f>their portion will be in <f>ⓧ</f>the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is <f>ⓨ</f>the second death.”
Revelation 21-9 <pb/>Then came <f>ⓩ</f>one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of <f>ⓐ</f>the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you <f>ⓑ</f>the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
Revelation 21-10 And <f>ⓒ</f>he carried me away in the Spirit to <f>ⓓ</f>a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,
Revelation 21-11 <f>ⓔ</f> having the glory of God, <f>ⓕ</f>its radiance <f>ⓖ</f>like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
Revelation 21-12 It had a great, high wall, <f>ⓗ</f>with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed —
Revelation 21-13 on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
Revelation 21-14 And the wall of the city had twelve <f>ⓘ</f>foundations, and <f>ⓙ</f>on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Revelation 21-15 <pb/>And the one who spoke with me <f>ⓚ</f>had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.
Revelation 21-16 The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. <f>[4]</f> Its length and width and height are equal.
Revelation 21-17 He also measured its wall, 144 cubits <f>[5]</f> by <f>ⓛ</f>human measurement, which is also <f>ⓜ</f>an angel's measurement.
Revelation 21-18 The wall was built of <f>ⓝ</f>jasper, while the city was pure gold, like <f>ⓞ</f>clear glass.
Revelation 21-19 <f>ⓟ</f> The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
Revelation 21-20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
Revelation 21-21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and <f>ⓠ</f>the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
Revelation 21-22 <pb/>And <f>ⓡ</f>I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
Revelation 21-23 And the city <f>ⓢ</f>has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for <f>ⓣ</f>the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.
Revelation 21-24 By its light <f>ⓤ</f>will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth <f>ⓥ</f>will bring their glory into it,
