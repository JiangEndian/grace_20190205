4-1 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
4-2 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <f>ⓐ</f>If anyone sins unintentionally <f>[1]</f> in any of the LORD's commandments <f>ⓑ</f>about things not to be done, and does any one of them,
4-3 if it is the anointed priest who <f>ⓒ</f>sins, thus bringing guilt on the people, then he shall offer for the sin that he has committed <f>ⓓ</f>a bull from the herd without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.
4-4 He shall bring the bull to the <f>ⓔ</f>entrance of the tent of meeting before the LORD and lay his hand on the head of the bull and kill the bull before the LORD.
4-5 And the anointed priest <f>ⓕ</f>shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it into the tent of meeting,
4-6 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and <f>ⓖ</f>sprinkle part of the blood seven times before the LORD in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
4-7 And the priest <f>ⓗ</f>shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the LORD that is in the tent of meeting, and <f>ⓘ</f>all the rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4-8 And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall remove from it, <f>ⓙ</f>the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails
4-9 <f>ⓚ</f> and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove with the kidneys
4-10 (just as these are taken from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offerings); and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.
4-11 But <f>ⓛ</f>the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head, its legs, its entrails, and its dung —
4-12 all the rest of the bull — he shall carry <f>ⓜ</f>outside the camp to a clean place, to the ash heap, and shall <f>ⓝ</f>burn it up on a fire of wood. On the ash heap it shall be burned up.
4-13 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> “If the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓟ</f>the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they do any one of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done, and they realize their guilt, <f>[3]</f>
4-14 <f>ⓠ</f> when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall offer a bull from the herd for a sin offering and bring it in front of the tent of meeting.
4-15 And the elders of the congregation <f>ⓡ</f>shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD, and the bull shall be killed before the LORD.
4-16 Then <f>ⓢ</f>the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull into the tent of meeting,
4-17 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil.
4-18 And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is in the tent of meeting before the LORD, and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4-19 And all its fat he shall take from it and burn on the altar.
4-20 Thus shall he do with the bull. As he did <f>ⓣ</f>with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this. <f>ⓤ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
4-21 And he shall carry the bull <f>ⓥ</f>outside the camp and burn it up as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
4-22 <pb/>“When a leader sins, <f>ⓦ</f>doing unintentionally any one of all the things that by the commandments of the LORD his God ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt,
4-23 or <f>ⓧ</f>the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish,
4-24 and <f>ⓨ</f>shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD; it is a sin offering.
4-25 <f>ⓩ</f> Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
4-26 And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like <f>ⓐ</f>the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. So <f>ⓑ</f>the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
4-27 <pb/>“If <f>ⓒ</f>anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any one of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done, and realizes his guilt,
4-28 <f>ⓓ</f> or the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed.
4-29 <f>ⓔ</f> And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering.
4-30 And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
4-31 And <f>ⓕ</f>all its fat he shall remove, <f>ⓖ</f>as the fat is removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a <f>ⓗ</f>pleasing aroma to the LORD. <f>ⓘ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
4-32 <pb/>“If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring <f>ⓙ</f>a female without blemish
4-33 <f>ⓚ</f> and lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.
4-34 Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
4-35 And all its fat he shall remove <f>ⓛ</f>as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on top of the LORD's food offerings. <f>ⓜ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.
23-1 <pb/>Then Job answered and said:
23-2 <pb/><t>“Today also my <f>ⓐ</f>complaint is bitter; <f>[1]</f> </t><t>my <f>ⓑ</f>hand is heavy on account of my groaning.</t>
23-3 <t>Oh, <f>ⓒ</f>that I knew where I might find him, </t><t>that I might come even to his <f>ⓓ</f>seat!</t>
23-4 <t>I would <f>ⓔ</f>lay my case before him </t><t>and fill my mouth with arguments.</t>
23-5 <t>I would know what he would answer me </t><t>and understand what he would say to me.</t>
23-6 <t>Would he <f>ⓕ</f>contend with me in the greatness of his power? </t><t>No; he would pay attention to me.</t>
23-7 <t>There an upright man could argue with him, </t><t>and I would be acquitted forever by my judge. </t>
23-8 <pb/><t>“Behold, <f>ⓖ</f>I go forward, but he is not there, </t><t>and backward, but I do not perceive him;</t>
23-9 <t>on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; </t><t>he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him.</t>
23-10 <t>But he <f>ⓗ</f>knows <f>ⓘ</f>the way that I <f>ⓙ</f>take; </t><t>when he has <f>ⓚ</f>tried me, I shall come out as gold.</t>
23-11 <t>My foot <f>ⓛ</f>has held fast to his steps; </t><t>I have kept his way and have <f>ⓜ</f>not turned aside.</t>
23-12 <t>I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; </t><t>I have <f>ⓝ</f>treasured the words of his mouth more than my <f>ⓞ</f>portion of food.</t>
23-13 <t>But he is unchangeable, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓟ</f>who can turn him back? </t><t>What he <f>ⓠ</f>desires, that he does.</t>
23-14 <t>For he will complete what he <f>ⓡ</f>appoints for me, </t><t>and many such things are <f>ⓢ</f>in his mind.</t>
23-15 <t>Therefore I am terrified at his presence; </t><t>when I consider, I am in dread of him.</t>
23-16 <t>God has made my <f>ⓣ</f>heart faint; </t><t>the Almighty has terrified me;</t>
23-17 <t>yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, </t><t>nor because thick darkness covers my face. </t>
22-1 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
22-2 “And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>will you judge, will you judge <f>ⓒ</f>the bloody city? <f>ⓓ</f>Then declare to her all her abominations.
22-3 You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in her midst, so that <f>ⓔ</f>her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself!
22-4 You have become guilty <f>ⓕ</f>by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made, and you have brought <f>ⓖ</f>your days near, the appointed time of <f>[1]</f> your years has come. <f>ⓗ</f>Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all the countries.
22-5 Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you; <f>ⓘ</f>your name is defiled; <f>ⓙ</f>you are full of tumult.
22-6 <pb/>“Behold, <f>ⓚ</f>the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood.
22-7 Father and mother <f>ⓛ</f>are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner <f>ⓜ</f>suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow <f>ⓝ</f>are wronged in you.
22-8 <f>ⓞ</f> You have despised my holy things and <f>ⓟ</f>profaned my Sabbaths.
22-9 <f>ⓠ</f> There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and people in you <f>ⓡ</f>who eat on the mountains; <f>ⓢ</f>they commit lewdness in your midst.
22-10 In you <f>ⓣ</f>men uncover their fathers' nakedness; in you they violate women who are unclean in their menstrual impurity.
22-11 <f>ⓤ</f> One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; <f>ⓥ</f>another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; <f>ⓦ</f>another in you violates his sister, his father's daughter.
22-12 In you <f>ⓧ</f>they take bribes to shed blood; <f>ⓨ</f>you take interest and profit <f>[2]</f> and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; but <f>ⓩ</f>me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD.
22-13 <pb/>“Behold, <f>ⓐ</f>I strike my hand at <f>ⓑ</f>the dishonest gain that you have made, and at <f>ⓒ</f>the blood that has been in your midst.
22-14 <f>ⓓ</f> Can your courage endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? <f>ⓔ</f>I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.
22-15 <f>ⓕ</f> I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, and <f>ⓖ</f>I will consume your uncleanness out of you.
22-16 And <f>ⓗ</f>you shall be profaned by your own doing <f>ⓘ</f>in the sight of the nations, <f>ⓙ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.”
22-17 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
22-18 <f>ⓚ</f> “Son of man, the house of Israel has become <f>ⓛ</f>dross to me; all of them are <f>ⓜ</f>bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are <f>ⓝ</f>dross of silver.
22-19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
22-20 As one gathers silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into a furnace, <f>ⓞ</f>to blow the fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you <f>ⓟ</f>in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you in and melt you.
22-21 I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it.
22-22 As silver is melted in a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD; <f>ⓠ</f>I have poured out my wrath upon you.”
22-23 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
22-24 “Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is <f>ⓡ</f>not cleansed <f>ⓢ</f>or rained upon in the day of indignation.
22-25 <f>ⓣ</f> The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is <f>ⓤ</f>like a roaring lion <f>ⓥ</f>tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.
22-26 <f>ⓦ</f> Her priests <f>ⓧ</f>have done violence to my law and <f>ⓨ</f>have profaned my holy things. <f>ⓩ</f>They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and <f>ⓐ</f>they have disregarded my Sabbaths, <f>ⓑ</f>so that I am profaned among them.
22-27 <f>ⓒ</f> Her princes in her midst are like wolves <f>ⓓ</f>tearing the prey, <f>ⓔ</f>shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain.
22-28 And <f>ⓕ</f>her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, <f>ⓖ</f>seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ when the LORD has not spoken.
22-29 The people of the land <f>ⓗ</f>have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and <f>ⓘ</f>have extorted from the sojourner without justice.
22-30 <f>ⓙ</f> And I sought for a man among them <f>ⓚ</f>who should build up the wall <f>ⓛ</f>and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none.
22-31 Therefore <f>ⓜ</f>I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned <f>ⓝ</f>their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.”
