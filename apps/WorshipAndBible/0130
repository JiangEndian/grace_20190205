Isaiah 26-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Open the gates, </t><t>that the righteous nation that keeps faith may enter in.</t>
Isaiah 26-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> You keep him in perfect peace </t><t>whose mind is stayed on you, </t><t>because he trusts in you.</t>
Isaiah 26-4 <t>Trust in the LORD forever, </t><t>for the LORD GOD is an everlasting rock.</t>
Isaiah 26-5 <t><f>ⓔ</f> For he has humbled </t><t>the inhabitants of the height, </t><t>the lofty city. </t><t>He lays it low, lays it low to the ground, </t><t>casts it to the dust.</t>
Isaiah 26-6 <t>The foot tramples it, </t><t>the feet of <f>ⓕ</f>the poor, </t><t>the steps of <f>ⓖ</f>the needy.” </t>

Isaiah 26-8 <t>In the path of your judgments, </t><t>O LORD, we wait for you; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>your name and <f>ⓙ</f>remembrance </t><t>are the desire of our soul.</t>
Isaiah 26-9 <t>My soul yearns for you in the night; </t><t>my spirit within me earnestly seeks you. </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>For when your judgments are in the earth, </t><t>the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</t>
Isaiah 26-10 <t><f>ⓛ</f> If favor is shown to the wicked, </t><t>he does not learn righteousness; </t><t>in the land of uprightness he deals corruptly </t><t>and does not see the majesty of the LORD.</t>
Isaiah 26-11 <t>O LORD, <f>ⓜ</f>your hand is lifted up, </t><t>but <f>ⓝ</f>they do not see it. </t><t>Let them see your zeal for your people, and be ashamed. </t><t>Let <f>ⓞ</f>the fire for your adversaries consume them.</t>
Isaiah 26-12 <t>O LORD, you will ordain <f>ⓟ</f>peace for us, </t><t>for you have indeed done for us all our works.</t>
Isaiah 26-13 <t>O LORD our God, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>other lords besides you have ruled over us, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>but your name alone we bring to remembrance.</t>
Isaiah 26-14 <t>They are dead, they will not live; </t><t>they are shades, they will not arise; </t><t>to that end you have visited them with destruction </t><t>and wiped out all remembrance of them.</t>
Isaiah 26-15 <t><f>ⓢ</f> But you have increased the nation, O LORD, </t><t>you have increased the nation; you are glorified; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>you have enlarged all the borders of the land. </t>
Isaiah 26-16 <pb/><t>O LORD, <f>ⓤ</f>in distress they sought you; </t><t>they poured out a whispered prayer </t><t>when your discipline was upon them.</t>
Isaiah 26-17 <t><f>ⓥ</f> Like a pregnant woman </t><t>who writhes and cries out in her pangs </t><t>when she is near to giving birth, </t><t>so were we because of you, O LORD;</t>
Isaiah 26-18 <t><f>ⓦ</f> we were pregnant, we writhed, </t><t>but we have given birth to wind. </t><t>We have accomplished no deliverance in the earth, </t><t>and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.</t>

Isaiah 26-21 <t><f>ⓐ</f> For behold, the LORD is coming out from his place </t><t>to punish the inhabitants of <f>ⓑ</f>the earth for their iniquity, </t><t>and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it, </t><t>and will no more cover its slain. </t>
1 Corinthians 8-1 <pb/>Now concerning <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>food offered to idols: we know that <f>ⓑ</f>“all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge” <f>ⓒ</f>puffs up, <f>ⓓ</f>but love builds up.
1 Corinthians 8-2 <f>ⓔ</f> If anyone imagines that he knows something, <f>ⓕ</f>he does not yet know as he ought to know.
1 Corinthians 8-3 But if anyone loves God, <f>ⓖ</f>he is known by God. <f>[2]</f>
1 Corinthians 8-4 <pb/>Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that <f>ⓗ</f>“an idol has no real existence,” and that <f>ⓘ</f>“there is no God but one.”
1 Corinthians 8-5 For although there may be <f>ⓙ</f>so-called gods in heaven or on earth — as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords” —
1 Corinthians 8-6 yet <f>ⓚ</f>for us there is one God, the Father, <f>ⓛ</f>from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and <f>ⓜ</f>one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and <f>ⓝ</f>through whom we exist.
1 Corinthians 8-7 <pb/>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, <f>ⓞ</f>through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and <f>ⓟ</f>their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
1 Corinthians 8-8 <f>ⓠ</f> Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
1 Corinthians 8-9 But take care <f>ⓡ</f>that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block <f>ⓢ</f>to the weak.
1 Corinthians 8-10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating <f>[3]</f> in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, <f>[4]</f> if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?
1 Corinthians 8-11 And so by your knowledge this weak person is <f>ⓣ</f>destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.
1 Corinthians 8-12 Thus, sinning against your brothers <f>[5]</f> and <f>ⓤ</f>wounding their conscience when it is weak, <f>ⓥ</f>you sin against Christ.
1 Corinthians 8-13 Therefore, <f>ⓦ</f>if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
