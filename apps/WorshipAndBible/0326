30-1 <pb/>When Rachel saw that <f>ⓐ</f>she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister. She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I shall die!”
30-2 Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, <f>ⓑ</f>who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
30-3 Then she said, “Here is my servant <f>ⓒ</f>Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth <f>ⓓ</f>on my behalf, <f>[1]</f> that even I may have children <f>[2]</f> through her.”
30-4 So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.
30-5 And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
30-6 Then Rachel said, “God has <f>ⓔ</f>judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan. <f>[3]</f>
30-7 Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
30-8 Then Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings <f>[4]</f> I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed.” So she called his name <f>ⓕ</f>Naphtali. <f>[5]</f>
30-9 <pb/>When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and <f>ⓖ</f>gave her to Jacob as a wife.
30-10 Then Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
30-11 And Leah said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Good fortune has come!” so she called his name <f>ⓘ</f>Gad. <f>[6]</f>
30-12 Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
30-13 And Leah said, “Happy am I! For women <f>ⓙ</f>have called me happy.” So she called his name Asher. <f>[7]</f>
30-14 <pb/>In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found <f>ⓚ</f>mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.”
30-15 But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?” Rachel said, “Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes.”
30-16 When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night.
30-17 And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
30-18 Leah said, “God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband.” So she called his name Issachar. <f>[8]</f>
30-19 <pb/>And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.
30-20 Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she called his name <f>ⓛ</f>Zebulun. <f>[9]</f>
30-21 Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.
30-22 <pb/>Then God <f>ⓜ</f>remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and <f>ⓝ</f>opened her womb.
30-23 She conceived and bore a son and said, “God has taken away <f>ⓞ</f>my reproach.”
30-24 And she called his name Joseph, <f>[10]</f> saying, <f>ⓟ</f>“May the LORD add to me another son!”
30-25 <pb/>As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.
30-26 Give me my wives and my children <f>ⓠ</f>for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you.”
30-27 But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by divination that <f>[11]</f> the LORD has blessed me because of you.
30-28 <f>ⓡ</f> Name your wages, and I will give it.”
30-29 Jacob said to him, <f>ⓢ</f>“You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.
30-30 For you had little before I came, <f>ⓣ</f>and it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I <f>ⓤ</f>provide for my own household also?”
30-31 He said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it:
30-32 let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and <f>ⓥ</f>they shall be my wages.
30-33 So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.”
30-34 Laban said, “Good! Let it be as you have said.”
30-35 But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in the charge of his sons.
30-36 And he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban's flock.
30-37 <pb/>Then <f>ⓦ</f>Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks.
30-38 He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the <f>ⓧ</f>watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,
30-39 the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
30-40 And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.
30-41 Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks,
30-42 but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
30-43 Thus the man <f>ⓨ</f>increased greatly and <f>ⓩ</f>had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
28-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done,
28-2 but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made <f>ⓑ</f>metal images for <f>ⓒ</f>the Baals,
28-3 and <f>ⓓ</f>he made offerings in the <f>ⓔ</f>Valley of the Son of Hinnom and <f>ⓕ</f>burned his sons as an offering, <f>[1]</f> according to <f>ⓖ</f>the abominations of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
28-4 And he sacrificed and <f>ⓗ</f>made offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
28-5 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with great force.
28-6 For <f>ⓙ</f>Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 from Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.
28-7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son and Azrikam the commander of the palace and Elkanah the next in authority to the king.
28-8 <pb/>The men of Israel took captive 200,000 <f>ⓚ</f>of their relatives, women, sons, and daughters. They also took much spoil from them and brought the spoil to Samaria.
28-9 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded, and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria and said to them, “Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, <f>ⓛ</f>was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have killed them in a rage <f>ⓜ</f>that has reached up to heaven.
28-10 And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against the LORD your God?
28-11 Now hear me, and send back the captives <f>ⓝ</f>from your relatives whom you have taken, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.”
28-12 <pb/>Certain chiefs also of the men of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were coming from the war
28-13 and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives in here, for you propose to bring upon us guilt against the LORD in addition to our present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.”
28-14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
28-15 And <f>ⓞ</f>the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them. They clothed them, gave them sandals, <f>ⓟ</f>provided them with food and drink, and anointed them, and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, <f>ⓠ</f>the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.
28-16 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> At that time King Ahaz sent to the king <f>[2]</f> of Assyria for help.
28-17 For the Edomites had again invaded and defeated Judah and carried away captives.
28-18 <f>ⓢ</f> And the Philistines had made raids on <f>ⓣ</f>the cities in the Shephelah and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco <f>ⓤ</f>with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. And they settled there.
28-19 For the LORD humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had made <f>ⓥ</f>Judah act sinfully <f>[3]</f> and had been very unfaithful to the LORD.
28-20 So <f>ⓦ</f>Tiglath-pileser <f>[4]</f> king of Assyria came against him and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
28-21 <f>ⓧ</f> For Ahaz took a portion from the house of the LORD and the house of the king and of the princes, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.
28-22 <pb/>In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the LORD — this same King Ahaz.
28-23 For <f>ⓨ</f>he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him and said, <f>ⓩ</f>“Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.
28-24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and <f>ⓐ</f>cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made himself <f>ⓑ</f>altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
28-25 In every city of Judah he made high places to <f>ⓒ</f>make offerings to other gods, provoking to anger the LORD, the God of his fathers.
28-26 <f>ⓓ</f> Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
28-27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for <f>ⓔ</f>they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
15-1 <pb/>Then the LORD said to me, <f>ⓐ</f>“Though <f>ⓑ</f>Moses <f>ⓒ</f>and Samuel <f>ⓓ</f>stood before me, yet my heart would not turn toward this people. Send them out of my sight, and let them go!
15-2 And when they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f>“‘Those who are for pestilence, to pestilence, </t><t>and those who are for the sword, to the sword; </t><t>those who are for famine, to famine, </t><t>and those who are for captivity, to captivity.’ </t>
15-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, declares the LORD: the sword to kill, the dogs to tear, and <f>ⓖ</f>the birds of the air <f>ⓗ</f>and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
15-4 <f>ⓘ</f> And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what <f>ⓙ</f>Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.
15-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> “Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>or who will grieve for you? </t><t>Who will turn aside </t><t>to ask about your welfare?</t>
15-6 <t><f>ⓜ</f> You have rejected me, declares the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>you keep going backward, </t><t>so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you — </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>I am weary of relenting.</t>
15-7 <t><f>ⓟ</f> I have winnowed them with <f>ⓠ</f>a winnowing fork </t><t>in the gates of the land; </t><t>I have bereaved them; I have destroyed my people; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>they did not turn from their ways.</t>
15-8 <t>I have made their widows more in number </t><t>than <f>ⓢ</f>the sand of the seas; </t><t>I have brought against the mothers of young men </t><t>a destroyer at noonday; </t><t>I have made anguish and terror </t><t>fall upon them suddenly.</t>
15-9 <t><f>ⓣ</f> She who bore seven has grown feeble; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>she has fainted away; </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>her sun went down while it was yet day; </t><t>she has been shamed and disgraced. </t><t>And the rest of them I will give to the sword </t><t>before their enemies, <pb/>declares the LORD.” </t>
15-10 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Woe is me, my mother, that you bore me, a man of strife and contention to the whole land! <f>ⓧ</f>I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me.
15-11 The LORD said, “Have I not <f>[1]</f> set you free for their good? Have I not pleaded for you before the enemy in the time of trouble and in the time of distress?
15-12 Can one break iron, iron <f>ⓨ</f>from the north, and bronze?
15-13 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> “Your wealth and your treasures I will give as <f>ⓐ</f>spoil, without price, for all your sins, throughout all your territory.
15-14 I will make you serve your enemies <f>ⓑ</f>in a land that you do not know, <f>ⓒ</f>for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.”
15-15 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> O LORD, you know; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>remember me and visit me, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f> <f>ⓖ</f>and take vengeance for me on my persecutors. </t><t>In your forbearance take me not away; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>know that <f>ⓘ</f>for your sake I bear reproach.</t>
15-16 <t>Your words were found, <f>ⓙ</f>and I ate them, </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>your words became to me a joy </t><t>and the delight of my heart, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>for I am called by your name, </t><t>O LORD, God of hosts.</t>
15-17 <t><f>ⓜ</f> I did not sit in the company of revelers, </t><t>nor did I rejoice; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>I sat alone, because your hand was upon me, </t><t>for you had filled me with indignation.</t>
15-18 <t>Why is my pain unceasing, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>my wound incurable, </t><t>refusing to be healed? </t><t>Will you be to me <f>ⓟ</f>like a deceitful brook, </t><t>like waters that fail? </t>
15-19 <pb/><t>Therefore thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>“If you return, I will restore you, </t><t>and you shall <f>ⓡ</f>stand before me. </t><t>If you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless, </t><t>you shall be as my mouth. </t><t>They shall turn to you, </t><t>but you shall not turn to them.</t>
15-20 <t><f>ⓢ</f> And I will make you to this people </t><t>a fortified wall of bronze; </t><t>they will fight against you, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>but they shall not prevail over you, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>for I am with you </t><t>to save you and deliver you, <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
15-21 <t><f>ⓥ</f> I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, </t><t>and redeem you from the grasp of <f>ⓦ</f>the ruthless.” </t>
1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>an apostle of Christ Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>by the will of God according to <f>ⓒ</f>the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus,

1-5 I am reminded of <f>ⓛ</f>your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and <f>ⓜ</f>your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.
1-6 For this reason I remind you <f>ⓝ</f>to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands,

1-8 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓠ</f>do not be ashamed of <f>ⓡ</f>the testimony about our Lord, nor of <f>ⓢ</f>me his prisoner, but <f>ⓣ</f>share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God,

1-10 and which now has <f>ⓩ</f>been manifested through <f>ⓐ</f>the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>who abolished death and <f>ⓒ</f>brought life and <f>ⓓ</f>immortality to light through the gospel,
1-11 <f>ⓔ</f> for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher,
