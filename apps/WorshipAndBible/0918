7-3 <J>Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but <f>ⓓ</f>do not notice the log that is in your own eye?</J>
7-4 <J>Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye?</J>
7-5 <J>You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.</J>

7-17 <J>So, <f>ⓧ</f>every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.</J>
7-18 <J>A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.</J>
