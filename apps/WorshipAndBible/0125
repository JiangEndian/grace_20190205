22-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of <f>ⓑ</f>Bozkath.
22-2 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in all the way of David his father, <f>ⓒ</f>and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.
22-3 <pb/>In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the house of the LORD, saying,
22-4 “Go up to <f>ⓓ</f>Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money <f>ⓔ</f>that has been brought into the house of the LORD, which <f>ⓕ</f>the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people.
22-5 <f>ⓖ</f> And let it be given into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD, and let them give it to the workmen who are at the house of the LORD, repairing the house
22-6 (that is, to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons), and let them use it for buying timber and quarried stone to repair the house.
22-7 But <f>ⓗ</f>no accounting shall be asked from them for the money that is delivered into their hand, for they deal honestly.”
22-8 <pb/>And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found <f>ⓘ</f>the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD.” And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
22-9 And Shaphan the secretary came to the king, and reported to the king, “Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the LORD.”
22-10 Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read it before the king.
22-11 <pb/>When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, <f>ⓙ</f>he tore his clothes.
22-12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and <f>ⓚ</f>Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and <f>ⓛ</f>Achbor the son of <f>ⓜ</f>Micaiah, and Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying,
22-13 “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For great is <f>ⓝ</f>the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.”
22-14 <pb/>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of <f>ⓞ</f>Tikvah, son of <f>ⓟ</f>Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in <f>ⓠ</f>the Second Quarter), and they talked with her.
22-15 And she said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,
22-16 Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.
22-17 <f>ⓡ</f> Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore <f>ⓢ</f>my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.
22-18 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard,
22-19 <f>ⓣ</f> because your heart was penitent, and you <f>ⓤ</f>humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they should become <f>ⓥ</f>a desolation and <f>ⓦ</f>a curse, and you <f>ⓧ</f>have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the LORD.
22-20 Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and <f>ⓨ</f>you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place.’” And they brought back word to the king.
21-1 <pb/>The <f>ⓐ</f>oracle concerning the wilderness of <f>ⓑ</f>the sea. <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>As whirlwinds in the Negeb sweep on, </t><t>it comes from the wilderness, </t><t>from a terrible land.</t>
21-2 <t>A stern vision is told to me; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>the traitor betrays, </t><t>and the destroyer destroys. </t><t>Go up, O <f>ⓔ</f>Elam; </t><t>lay siege, O <f>ⓕ</f>Media; </t><t>all the <f>ⓖ</f>sighing she has caused </t><t>I bring to an end.</t>
21-3 <t>Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>pangs have seized me, </t><t>like the pangs of a woman in labor; </t><t>I am bowed down so that I cannot hear; </t><t>I am dismayed so that I cannot see.</t>
21-4 <t>My heart staggers; horror has appalled me; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>the twilight I longed for </t><t>has been turned for me into trembling.</t>
21-5 <t><f>ⓙ</f> They prepare the table, </t><t>they spread the rugs, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>they eat, they drink. </t><t>Arise, O princes; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>oil the shield!</t>
21-6 <t>For thus the Lord said to me: </t><t>“Go, set a watchman; </t><t>let him announce what he sees.</t>
21-7 <t>When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs, </t><t>riders on donkeys, riders on camels, </t><t>let him listen diligently, </t><t>very diligently.”</t>
21-8 <t>Then he who saw cried out: <f>[2]</f> </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>“Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord, </t><t>continually by day, </t><t>and at my post I am stationed </t><t>whole nights.</t>
21-9 <t>And behold, here come riders, </t><t>horsemen in pairs!” </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>And he answered, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>“Fallen, fallen is Babylon; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and all the carved images of her gods </t><t>he has shattered to the ground.”</t>
21-10 <t>O <f>ⓟ</f>my threshed and winnowed one, </t><t>what I have heard from the LORD of hosts, </t><t>the God of Israel, I announce to you. </t>
21-11 <pb/>The <f>ⓠ</f>oracle concerning <f>ⓡ</f>Dumah. <pb/><t>One is calling to me from <f>ⓢ</f>Seir, </t><t>“Watchman, what time of the night? </t><t>Watchman, what time of the night?”</t>
21-12 <t>The watchman says: </t><t>“Morning comes, and also <f>ⓣ</f>the night. </t><t>If you will inquire, <f>ⓤ</f>inquire; </t><t>come back again.” </t>
21-13 <pb/>The <f>ⓥ</f>oracle concerning <f>ⓦ</f>Arabia. <pb/><t>In the thickets in <f>ⓧ</f>Arabia you will lodge, </t><t>O <f>ⓨ</f>caravans of <f>ⓩ</f>Dedanites.</t>
21-14 <t>To the thirsty bring water; </t><t>meet the fugitive with bread, </t><t>O inhabitants of the land of <f>ⓐ</f>Tema.</t>
21-15 <t>For they have fled from the swords, </t><t>from the drawn sword, </t><t>from the bent bow, </t><t>and from the press of battle. </t>
21-16 <pb/>For thus the Lord said to me, “Within a year, <f>ⓑ</f>according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of <f>ⓒ</f>Kedar will come to an end.
21-17 And the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of <f>ⓓ</f>Kedar will be few, <f>ⓔ</f>for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.”
3-1 <pb/>But I, brothers, <f>[1]</f> could not address you as <f>ⓐ</f>spiritual people, but as <f>ⓑ</f>people of the flesh, as <f>ⓒ</f>infants in Christ.
3-2 <f>ⓓ</f> I fed you with milk, not solid food, for <f>ⓔ</f>you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready,
3-3 for you are still of the flesh. For while there is <f>ⓕ</f>jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?
3-4 For <f>ⓖ</f>when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” <f>ⓗ</f>are you not being merely human?
3-5 <pb/>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? <f>ⓘ</f>Servants through whom you believed, <f>ⓙ</f>as the Lord assigned to each.
3-6 <f>ⓚ</f> I planted, <f>ⓛ</f>Apollos watered, <f>ⓜ</f>but God gave the growth.
3-7 So <f>ⓝ</f>neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
3-8 He who plants and he who waters are one, and each <f>ⓞ</f>will receive his wages according to his labor.
3-9 For we are <f>ⓟ</f>God's fellow workers. You are God's field, <f>ⓠ</f>God's building.
3-10 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled <f>[2]</f> master builder I laid a <f>ⓢ</f>foundation, and <f>ⓣ</f>someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it.
3-11 For no one can lay a <f>ⓤ</f>foundation other <f>ⓥ</f>than that which is laid, <f>ⓦ</f>which is Jesus Christ.
3-12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw —
3-13 <f>ⓧ</f> each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed <f>ⓨ</f>by fire, and <f>ⓩ</f>the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
3-14 If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, <f>ⓐ</f>he will receive a reward.
3-15 If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, <f>ⓑ</f>but only as through fire.
3-16 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> Do you not know that you <f>[3]</f> are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?
3-17 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For <f>ⓓ</f>God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.
3-18 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Let no one deceive himself. <f>ⓕ</f>If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
3-19 For <f>ⓖ</f>the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, <f>ⓗ</f>“He catches the wise in their craftiness,”
3-20 and again, <f>ⓘ</f>“The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”
3-21 So <f>ⓙ</f>let no one boast in men. For <f>ⓚ</f>all things are yours,
3-22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future — all are yours,
3-23 and <f>ⓛ</f>you are Christ's, and <f>ⓜ</f>Christ is God's.
