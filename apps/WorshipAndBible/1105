18-1 <pb/>As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan <f>ⓐ</f>loved him as his own soul.
18-2 And Saul took him that day <f>ⓑ</f>and would not let him return to his father's house.
18-3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because <f>ⓒ</f>he loved him as his own soul.
18-4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his belt.
18-5 And David went out <f>ⓓ</f>and was successful wherever Saul sent him, so that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
18-6 <pb/>As they were coming home, when David returned from striking down the Philistine, <f>ⓔ</f>the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments. <f>[1]</f>
18-7 And the women <f>ⓕ</f>sang to one another as they celebrated, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“Saul has struck down his thousands, </t><t>and David his ten thousands.” </t>
18-8 <pb/>And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands, and what more can he have but <f>ⓗ</f>the kingdom?”
18-9 And Saul eyed David from that day on.
18-10 <pb/>The next day <f>ⓘ</f>a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and <f>ⓙ</f>he raved within his house while David was <f>ⓚ</f>playing the lyre, as he did day by day. <f>ⓛ</f>Saul had his spear in his hand.
18-11 And Saul <f>ⓜ</f>hurled the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice.
18-12 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> Saul was afraid of David because <f>ⓞ</f>the LORD was with him <f>ⓟ</f>but had departed from Saul.
18-13 So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand. <f>ⓠ</f>And he went out and came in before the people.
18-14 And David <f>ⓡ</f>had success in all his undertakings, <f>ⓢ</f>for the LORD was with him.
18-15 And when Saul saw that <f>ⓣ</f>he had great success, he stood in fearful awe of him.
18-16 <f>ⓤ</f> But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.
18-17 <pb/>Then Saul said to David, “Here is <f>ⓥ</f>my elder daughter Merab. <f>ⓦ</f>I will give her to you for a wife. Only be valiant for me <f>ⓧ</f>and fight the LORD's battles.” For Saul thought, “Let not my hand be against him, <f>ⓨ</f>but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”
18-18 And David said to Saul, <f>ⓩ</f>“Who am I, and who are my relatives, my father's clan in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”
18-19 But at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to <f>ⓐ</f>Adriel the <f>ⓑ</f>Meholathite for a wife.
18-20 <pb/>Now <f>ⓒ</f>Saul's daughter Michal <f>ⓓ</f>loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
18-21 Saul thought, “Let me give her to him, that she may <f>ⓔ</f>be a snare for him <f>ⓕ</f>and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>“You shall now be my son-in-law.”
18-22 And Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in private and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now then become the king's son-in-law.’”
18-23 And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man and have no reputation?”
18-24 And the servants of Saul told him, “Thus and so did David speak.”
18-25 Then Saul said, “Thus shall you say to David, ‘The king desires no <f>ⓘ</f>bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, <f>ⓙ</f>that he may be avenged of the king's enemies.’” <f>ⓚ</f>Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
18-26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. <f>ⓛ</f>Before the time had expired,
18-27 David arose and went, <f>ⓜ</f>along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. <f>ⓝ</f>And David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife.
18-28 But when Saul saw and knew that <f>ⓞ</f>the LORD was with David, <f>ⓟ</f>and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him,
18-29 Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David's enemy continually.
18-30 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out <f>ⓡ</f>David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.
141-1 <pb/><t>O LORD, I call upon you; <f>ⓐ</f>hasten to me! </t><t>Give ear to my voice when I call to you!</t>
141-2 <t>Let <f>ⓑ</f>my prayer be counted as incense before you, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>the lifting up of my hands as <f>ⓓ</f>the evening sacrifice! </t>
141-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>keep watch over the door of my lips!</t>
141-4 <t><f>ⓖ</f> Do not let my heart incline to any evil, </t><t>to busy myself with wicked deeds </t><t>in company with men who <f>ⓗ</f>work iniquity, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>let me not eat of their delicacies! </t>
141-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Let a righteous man strike me — it is a kindness; </t><t>let him rebuke me — it is oil for my head; </t><t>let my head not refuse it. </t><t>Yet <f>ⓚ</f>my prayer is continually against their evil deeds.</t>
141-6 <t>When their judges are <f>ⓛ</f>thrown over the cliff, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>then they shall hear my words, for they are pleasant.</t>
141-7 <t>As when one plows and breaks up the earth, </t><t>so shall our bones <f>ⓜ</f>be scattered at the mouth of Sheol. <f>[2]</f> </t>
141-8 <pb/><t>But <f>ⓝ</f>my eyes are toward you, O GOD, my Lord; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>in you I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless! <f>[3]</f></t>
141-9 <t>Keep me from <f>ⓟ</f>the trap that they have laid for me </t><t>and from the snares of evildoers!</t>
141-10 <t>Let the wicked <f>ⓠ</f>fall into their own nets, </t><t>while I pass by safely. </t>
11-1 <pb/>Now Jesus <f>[1]</f> was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, <f>ⓐ</f>as John taught his disciples.”
11-2 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“When you pray, say:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓒ</f>“Father, <f>ⓓ</f>hallowed be <f>ⓔ</f>your name.</J> </t><t><J> <f>ⓕ</f>Your kingdom come.</J></t>
11-3 <t><J><f>ⓖ</f> Give us <f>ⓗ</f>each day our daily bread, <f>[2]</f></J></t>
11-4 <t><J>and <f>ⓘ</f>forgive us our sins,</J> </t><t><J>for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.</J> </t><t><J>And <f>ⓙ</f>lead us not into temptation.”</J> </t>
11-5 <pb/>And he said to them, <J>“Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves,</J>
11-6 <J>for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him’;</J>
11-7 <J>and he will answer from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything’?</J>
11-8 <J>I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything <f>ⓚ</f>because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence <f>[3]</f> he will rise and give him whatever he needs.</J>
11-9 <J>And I tell you, <f>ⓛ</f>ask, and <f>ⓜ</f>it will be given to you; <f>ⓝ</f>seek, and you will find; <f>ⓞ</f>knock, and it will be opened to you.</J>
11-10 <J>For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.</J>
11-11 <J>What father among you, if his son asks for <f>[4]</f> a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent;</J>
11-12 <J>or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</J>
11-13 <J>If you then, <f>ⓟ</f>who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father <f>ⓠ</f>give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</J>
11-14 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marveled.
11-15 But some of them said, “He casts out demons <f>ⓢ</f>by Beelzebul, the prince of demons,”
11-16 while others, <f>ⓣ</f>to test him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven.
11-17 <f>ⓤ</f> But he, <f>ⓥ</f>knowing their thoughts, said to them, <J>“Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls.</J>
11-18 <J>And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.</J>
11-19 <J>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, <f>ⓦ</f>by whom do <f>ⓧ</f>your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</J>
11-20 <J>But if it is by <f>ⓨ</f>the finger of God that I cast out demons, then <f>ⓩ</f>the kingdom of God has come upon you.</J>
11-21 <J>When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are safe;</J>
11-22 <J><f>ⓐ</f> but when one stronger than he attacks him and <f>ⓑ</f>overcomes him, he takes away his <f>ⓒ</f>armor in which he trusted and <f>ⓓ</f>divides his spoil.</J>
11-23 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</J>
11-24 <pb/><J><f>ⓕ</f> “When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through <f>ⓖ</f>waterless places seeking rest, and finding none it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’</J>
11-25 <J>And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order.</J>
11-26 <J>Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And <f>ⓗ</f>the last state of that person is worse than the first.”</J>
11-27 <pb/>As he said these things, <f>ⓘ</f>a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, <f>ⓙ</f>“Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed!”
11-28 But he said, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“Blessed rather are those <f>ⓛ</f>who hear the word of God and <f>ⓜ</f>keep it!”</J>
11-29 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“This generation is an evil generation. <f>ⓟ</f>It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.</J>
11-30 <J>For as <f>ⓠ</f>Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.</J>
11-31 <J><f>ⓡ</f> The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and <f>ⓢ</f>condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, <f>ⓣ</f>something greater than Solomon is here.</J>
11-32 <J><f>ⓤ</f> The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and <f>ⓥ</f>condemn it, for <f>ⓦ</f>they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, <f>ⓧ</f>something greater than Jonah is here.</J>
11-33 <pb/><J><f>ⓨ</f> “No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.</J>
11-34 <J>Your eye is <f>ⓩ</f>the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is <f>ⓐ</f>bad, your body is full of darkness.</J>
11-35 <J><f>ⓑ</f> Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness.</J>
11-36 <J>If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, <f>ⓒ</f>as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.”</J>
11-37 <pb/>While Jesus <f>[5]</f> was speaking, <f>ⓓ</f>a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table.
11-38 The Pharisee was astonished to see <f>ⓔ</f>that he did not first wash before dinner.
11-39 And the Lord said to him, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of <f>ⓖ</f>greed and wickedness.</J>
11-40 <J><f>ⓗ</f> You fools! <f>ⓘ</f>Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?</J>
11-41 <J>But <f>ⓙ</f>give as alms those things that are within, and behold, <f>ⓚ</f>everything is clean for you.</J>
11-42 <pb/><J><f>ⓛ</f> “But woe to you Pharisees! For <f>ⓜ</f>you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect <f>ⓝ</f>justice and <f>ⓞ</f>the love of God. <f>ⓟ</f>These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</J>
11-43 <J>Woe to you Pharisees! For <f>ⓠ</f>you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</J>
11-44 <J>Woe to you! <f>ⓡ</f>For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.”</J>
11-45 <pb/>One of <f>ⓢ</f>the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also.”
11-46 And he said, <J>“Woe to you <f>ⓣ</f>lawyers also! For <f>ⓤ</f>you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</J>
11-47 <J><f>ⓥ</f> Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.</J>
11-48 <J><f>ⓦ</f> So you are witnesses and you <f>ⓧ</f>consent to the deeds of <f>ⓨ</f>your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs.</J>
11-49 <J>Therefore also <f>ⓩ</f>the Wisdom of God said, <f>ⓐ</f>‘I will send them <f>ⓑ</f>prophets and apostles, <f>ⓒ</f>some of whom they will <f>ⓓ</f>kill and persecute,’</J>
11-50 <J>so that <f>ⓔ</f>the blood of all the prophets, shed <f>ⓕ</f>from the foundation of the world, may be <f>ⓖ</f>charged against this generation,</J>
11-51 <J>from the blood of <f>ⓗ</f>Abel to the blood of <f>ⓘ</f>Zechariah, who perished between <f>ⓙ</f>the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be <f>ⓚ</f>required of this generation.</J>
11-52 <J>Woe to you <f>ⓛ</f>lawyers! <f>ⓜ</f>For you have taken away the key of <f>ⓝ</f>knowledge. You <f>ⓞ</f>did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.”</J>
11-53 <pb/>As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him to speak about many things,
11-54 <f>ⓟ</f> lying in wait for him, <f>ⓠ</f>to catch him in something he might say.
