30-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> who set out to go down to Egypt, </t><t>without asking for my direction, </t><t>to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh </t><t>and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!</t>
30-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame, </t><t>and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation.</t>

30-5 <t>everyone comes to shame </t><t>through <f>ⓘ</f>a people that cannot profit them, </t><t>that brings neither help nor profit, </t><t>but shame and disgrace.” </t>
30-6 <pb/>An <f>ⓙ</f>oracle on <f>ⓚ</f>the beasts of <f>ⓛ</f>the Negeb. <pb/><t>Through a land of trouble and anguish, </t><t>from where come the lioness and the lion, </t><t>the adder and the <f>ⓜ</f>flying fiery serpent, </t><t>they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys, </t><t>and their treasures on the humps of camels, </t><t>to a people that cannot profit them.</t>
30-7 <t>Egypt's <f>ⓝ</f>help is worthless and empty; </t><t>therefore I have called her </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>“Rahab who sits still.” </t>
30-8 <pb/><t>And now, go, <f>ⓟ</f>write it before them on a tablet </t><t>and inscribe it in a book, </t><t>that it may be for the time to come </t><t>as a witness forever. <f>[2]</f></t>
30-9 <t><f>ⓠ</f> For they are a rebellious people, </t><t>lying children, </t><t>children unwilling to hear </t><t>the instruction of the LORD;</t>
30-10 <t><f>ⓡ</f> who say to <f>ⓢ</f>the seers, “Do not see,” </t><t>and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us what is right; </t><t>speak to us <f>ⓣ</f>smooth things, </t><t>prophesy illusions,</t>
30-11 <t>leave the way, turn aside from the path, </t><t>let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel.”</t>
30-12 <t>Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, </t><t>“Because you despise this word </t><t>and trust in <f>ⓤ</f>oppression and perverseness </t><t>and rely on them,</t>
30-13 <t>therefore this iniquity shall be to you </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>like a breach in a high wall, bulging out and about to collapse, </t><t>whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant;</t>
30-14 <t>and its breaking is <f>ⓦ</f>like that of a potter's vessel </t><t>that is smashed so ruthlessly </t><t>that among its fragments not a shard is found </t><t>with which to take fire from the hearth, </t><t>or to dip up water out of the cistern.” </t>
30-15 <pb/><t>For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, </t><t>“In <f>ⓧ</f>returning <f>[3]</f> and <f>ⓨ</f>rest you shall be saved; </t><t>in quietness and in trust shall be your strength.” </t><t>But you were unwilling, </t>
30-16 <t>and you said, </t><t>“No! We will flee upon <f>ⓩ</f>horses”; </t><t>therefore you shall flee away; </t><t>and, “We will ride upon swift steeds”; </t><t>therefore your pursuers shall be swift.</t>
30-17 <t><f>ⓐ</f> A thousand shall flee at the threat of one; </t><t>at the threat of five you shall flee, </t><t>till you are left </t><t>like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, </t><t>like a signal on a hill. </t>
30-18 <pb/><t>Therefore the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>waits to be gracious to you, </t><t>and therefore he <f>ⓒ</f>exalts himself to show mercy to you. </t><t>For the LORD is a God of justice; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>blessed are all those who wait for him. </t>
30-19 <pb/>For a people shall dwell <f>ⓔ</f>in Zion, in Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. As soon as he hears it, he answers you.
30-20 And though the Lord give you the <f>ⓕ</f>bread of adversity and the <f>ⓖ</f>water of affliction, <f>ⓗ</f>yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore, but your eyes shall see your Teacher.
30-21 <f>ⓘ</f> And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is <f>ⓙ</f>the way, walk in it,” when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.
30-22 Then you will defile your carved idols overlaid with silver and your gold-plated metal images. <f>ⓚ</f>You will scatter them as unclean things. You will say to them, “Be gone!”
30-23 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And he will give <f>ⓜ</f>rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and bread, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. <f>ⓝ</f>In that day your livestock will graze in large pastures,
30-24 and <f>ⓞ</f>the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.
30-25 And <f>ⓟ</f>on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water, in the day of the great slaughter, <f>ⓠ</f>when the towers fall.
30-26 <f>ⓡ</f> Moreover, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when <f>ⓢ</f>the LORD binds up <f>ⓣ</f>the brokenness of his people, and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.
30-27 <pb/><t>Behold, the name of the LORD comes from afar, </t><t>burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke; <f>[4]</f> </t><t>his lips are full of fury, </t><t>and his tongue is like a devouring fire;</t>
30-28 <t><f>ⓤ</f> his breath is <f>ⓥ</f>like an overflowing stream </t><t>that reaches up to the neck; </t><t>to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction, </t><t>and to place on the jaws of the peoples <f>ⓦ</f>a bridle that leads astray. </t>
30-29 <pb/>You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, <f>ⓧ</f>as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to <f>ⓨ</f>the mountain of the LORD, to <f>ⓩ</f>the Rock of Israel.
30-30 And the LORD <f>ⓐ</f>will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger <f>ⓑ</f>and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst <f>ⓒ</f>and storm and hailstones.
30-31 The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the LORD, <f>ⓓ</f>when he strikes with his rod.
30-32 And every stroke of the appointed staff that the LORD lays on them <f>ⓔ</f>will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres. <f>ⓕ</f>Battling with brandished arm, he will fight with them.
30-33 For <f>ⓖ</f>a burning place <f>[5]</f> has long been prepared; indeed, for the king it is made ready, <f>ⓗ</f>its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; <f>ⓘ</f>the breath of the LORD, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
12-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>concerning <f>[1]</f> spiritual gifts, <f>[2]</f> brothers, <f>[3]</f> I do not want you to be uninformed.
12-2 You know that <f>ⓑ</f>when you were pagans <f>ⓒ</f>you were led astray to <f>ⓓ</f>mute idols, however you were led.
12-3 Therefore I want you to understand that <f>ⓔ</f>no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is <f>ⓕ</f>accursed!” and <f>ⓖ</f>no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.
12-4 <pb/>Now <f>ⓗ</f>there are varieties of gifts, but <f>ⓘ</f>the same Spirit;
12-5 and <f>ⓙ</f>there are varieties of service, but <f>ⓚ</f>the same Lord;
12-6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is <f>ⓛ</f>the same God who empowers them all in everyone.
12-7 <f>ⓜ</f> To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
12-8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of <f>ⓝ</f>wisdom, and to another the utterance of <f>ⓞ</f>knowledge according to the same Spirit,
12-9 to another <f>ⓟ</f>faith by the same Spirit, to another <f>ⓠ</f>gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
12-10 to another <f>ⓡ</f>the working of miracles, to another <f>ⓢ</f>prophecy, to another <f>ⓣ</f>the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another <f>ⓤ</f>various kinds of tongues, to another <f>ⓥ</f>the interpretation of tongues.
12-11 All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, <f>ⓦ</f>who apportions to each one individually <f>ⓧ</f>as he wills.
12-12 <pb/>For just as <f>ⓨ</f>the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, <f>ⓩ</f>so it is with Christ.
12-13 For <f>ⓐ</f>in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body — <f>ⓑ</f>Jews or Greeks, slaves <f>[4]</f> or free — and <f>ⓒ</f>all were made to drink of one Spirit.
12-14 <pb/>For the body does not consist of one member but of many.
12-15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
12-16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
12-17 If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?
12-18 But as it is, <f>ⓓ</f>God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, <f>ⓔ</f>as he chose.
12-19 If all were a single member, where would the body be?
12-20 As it is, there are many parts, <f>[5]</f> yet one body.
12-21 <pb/>The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”
12-22 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
12-23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
12-24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,
12-25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
12-26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, <f>ⓕ</f>all rejoice together.
12-27 <pb/>Now <f>ⓖ</f>you are the body of Christ and individually <f>ⓗ</f>members of it.
12-28 And <f>ⓘ</f>God has appointed in the church first <f>ⓙ</f>apostles, second <f>ⓚ</f>prophets, third teachers, then <f>ⓛ</f>miracles, then <f>ⓜ</f>gifts of healing, <f>ⓝ</f>helping, <f>ⓞ</f>administrating, and <f>ⓟ</f>various kinds of tongues.
12-29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
12-30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
12-31 But <f>ⓠ</f>earnestly desire the higher gifts. <pb/>And I will show you a still more excellent way.
