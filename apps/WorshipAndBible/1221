9-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> As soon as Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>and the king's house and <f>ⓒ</f>all that Solomon desired to build,
9-2 <f>ⓓ</f> the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
9-3 And the LORD said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house that you have built, <f>ⓔ</f>by putting my name there forever. <f>ⓕ</f>My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
9-4 And as for you, if you will <f>ⓖ</f>walk before me, <f>ⓗ</f>as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules,
9-5 <f>ⓘ</f> then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’
9-6 <f>ⓙ</f> But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,
9-7 <f>ⓚ</f> then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, <f>ⓛ</f>and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight, <f>ⓜ</f>and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
9-8 And this house will become a heap of ruins. <f>[1]</f> Everyone passing by it will be astonished and will hiss, and they will say, <f>ⓝ</f>‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?’
9-9 Then they will say, ‘Because <f>ⓞ</f>they abandoned the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore the LORD has brought all this disaster on them.’”
9-10 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> At the end of <f>ⓠ</f>twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house,
9-11 and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
9-12 But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, they did not please him.
9-13 Therefore he said, “What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?” So they are called the land of <f>ⓡ</f>Cabul to this day.
9-14 Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents <f>[2]</f> of gold.
9-15 <pb/>And this is the account of <f>ⓢ</f>the forced labor that King Solomon drafted to build the house of the LORD and his own house and <f>ⓣ</f>the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and <f>ⓤ</f>Hazor and <f>ⓥ</f>Megiddo and Gezer
9-16 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and had killed <f>ⓦ</f>the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as dowry to <f>ⓧ</f>his daughter, Solomon's wife;
9-17 so Solomon rebuilt Gezer) and <f>ⓨ</f>Lower Beth-horon
9-18 and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah, <f>[3]</f>
9-19 and all the store cities that Solomon had, and <f>ⓩ</f>the cities for his chariots, and the cities for <f>ⓐ</f>his horsemen, and whatever Solomon <f>ⓑ</f>desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
9-20 All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the people of Israel —
9-21 <f>ⓒ</f> their descendants who were left after them in the land, <f>ⓓ</f>whom the people of Israel were unable to devote to destruction <f>[4]</f> — <f>ⓔ</f>these Solomon drafted to be <f>ⓕ</f>slaves, and so they are to this day.
9-22 But <f>ⓖ</f>of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves. They were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen.
9-23 <pb/>These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work: <f>ⓗ</f>550 <f>ⓘ</f>who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
9-24 <pb/>But <f>ⓙ</f>Pharaoh's daughter went up from the city of David to <f>ⓚ</f>her own house that Solomon had built for her. <f>ⓛ</f>Then he built <f>ⓜ</f>the Millo.
9-25 <pb/>Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to the LORD, making offerings with it <f>[5]</f> before the LORD. So he finished the house.
9-26 <pb/>King Solomon built a fleet of ships at <f>ⓝ</f>Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
9-27 And Hiram sent <f>ⓞ</f>with the fleet his servants, seamen who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon.
9-28 And they went to <f>ⓟ</f>Ophir and brought from there gold, 420 talents, and they brought it to King Solomon.
6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:
6-2 a man <f>ⓑ</f>to whom <f>ⓒ</f>God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he <f>ⓓ</f>lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God <f>ⓔ</f>does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; <f>[1]</f> it is a grievous evil.
6-3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that <f>ⓕ</f>the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's <f>ⓖ</f>good things, and he also has no <f>ⓗ</f>burial, I say that <f>ⓘ</f>a stillborn child is better off than he.
6-4 For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.
6-5 Moreover, it has not <f>ⓙ</f>seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds <f>ⓚ</f>rest rather than he.
6-6 Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy <f>[2]</f> no good — do not all go to the one place?
6-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied. <f>[3]</f>
6-8 For what advantage has the wise man <f>ⓜ</f>over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?
6-9 Better <f>ⓝ</f>is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is <f>ⓞ</f>vanity and a striving after wind.
6-10 <pb/>Whatever has come to be has <f>ⓟ</f>already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to <f>ⓠ</f>dispute with one stronger than he.
6-11 The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?
6-12 For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his <f>ⓡ</f>vain <f>[4]</f> life, which he passes like <f>ⓢ</f>a shadow? For who can tell man what will be <f>ⓣ</f>after him under the sun?
12-1 <pb/>About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.
12-2 He killed <f>ⓐ</f>James the brother of John <f>ⓑ</f>with the sword,
12-3 and when he saw <f>ⓒ</f>that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during <f>ⓓ</f>the days of Unleavened Bread.
12-4 And when he had seized him, he put him <f>ⓔ</f>in prison, delivering him over to four <f>ⓕ</f>squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.
12-5 So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest <f>ⓖ</f>prayer for him was made to God by the church.
12-6 <pb/>Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, <f>ⓗ</f>bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.
12-7 And behold, <f>ⓘ</f>an angel of the Lord <f>ⓙ</f>stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. <f>ⓚ</f>He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, “Get up quickly.” And <f>ⓛ</f>the chains fell off his hands.
12-8 And the angel said to him, “Dress yourself and <f>ⓜ</f>put on your sandals.” And he did so. And he said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.”
12-9 And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but <f>ⓝ</f>thought he was seeing a vision.
12-10 When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. <f>ⓞ</f>It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him.
12-11 When Peter <f>ⓟ</f>came to himself, he said, “Now I am sure that <f>ⓠ</f>the Lord has sent his angel and <f>ⓡ</f>rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”
12-12 <pb/>When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of <f>ⓢ</f>John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and <f>ⓣ</f>were praying.
12-13 And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, <f>ⓤ</f>a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
12-14 Recognizing Peter's voice, <f>ⓥ</f>in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate.
12-15 They said to her, “You are out of your mind.” But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, “It is <f>ⓦ</f>his angel!”
12-16 But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.
12-17 But <f>ⓧ</f>motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Tell these things to <f>ⓨ</f>James and to <f>ⓩ</f>the brothers.” <f>[1]</f> Then he departed and went to another place.
12-18 <pb/>Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
12-19 And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and <f>ⓐ</f>ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.
12-20 <pb/>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and <f>ⓑ</f>having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, <f>[2]</f> they asked for peace, because <f>ⓒ</f>their country depended on the king's country for food.
12-21 On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them.
12-22 And the people were shouting, “The voice of a god, and not of a man!”
12-23 Immediately <f>ⓓ</f>an angel of the Lord struck him down, because <f>ⓔ</f>he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.
12-24 <pb/>But <f>ⓕ</f>the word of God increased and multiplied.
12-25 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And Barnabas and Saul returned from <f>[3]</f> Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them <f>ⓗ</f>John, whose other name was Mark.
