1 Samuel 16-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Samuel, <f>ⓐ</f>“How long will you grieve over Saul, since <f>ⓑ</f>I have rejected him from being king over Israel? <f>ⓒ</f>Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, <f>ⓓ</f>for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”
1 Samuel 16-2 And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” And the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you and say, <f>ⓔ</f>‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’
1 Samuel 16-3 And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. <f>ⓕ</f>And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you.”
1 Samuel 16-4 Samuel did what the LORD commanded and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city <f>ⓖ</f>came to meet him trembling and said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Do you come peaceably?”
1 Samuel 16-5 And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. <f>ⓘ</f>Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
1 Samuel 16-6 <pb/>When they came, he looked on <f>ⓙ</f>Eliab and thought, “Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.”
1 Samuel 16-7 But the LORD said to Samuel, <f>ⓚ</f>“Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, <f>ⓛ</f>but the LORD looks on the heart.”
1 Samuel 16-8 Then Jesse called <f>ⓜ</f>Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.”
1 Samuel 16-9 Then Jesse made <f>ⓝ</f>Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.”
1 Samuel 16-10 And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen these.”
1 Samuel 16-11 Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, <f>ⓞ</f>“There remains yet the youngest, <f>[1]</f> but behold, he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, <f>ⓟ</f>“Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.”
1 Samuel 16-12 And he sent and brought him in. Now he was <f>ⓠ</f>ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the LORD said, <f>ⓡ</f>“Arise, anoint him, for this is he.”
1 Samuel 16-13 Then Samuel took <f>ⓢ</f>the horn of oil <f>ⓣ</f>and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. <f>ⓤ</f>And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.
1 Samuel 16-14 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, <f>ⓦ</f>and a harmful spirit from the LORD tormented him.
1 Samuel 16-15 And Saul's servants said to him, “Behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you.
1 Samuel 16-16 Let our lord now command your servants <f>ⓧ</f>who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre, and when the harmful spirit from God is upon you, he will <f>ⓨ</f>play it, and you will be well.”
1 Samuel 16-17 So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me.”
1 Samuel 16-18 One of the young men answered, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, <f>ⓩ</f>a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence, <f>ⓐ</f>and the LORD is with him.”
1 Samuel 16-19 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son, <f>ⓑ</f>who is with the sheep.”
1 Samuel 16-20 <f>ⓒ</f> And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul.
1 Samuel 16-21 And David came to Saul <f>ⓓ</f>and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
1 Samuel 16-22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.”
1 Samuel 16-23 And <f>ⓔ</f>whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre <f>ⓕ</f>and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the harmful spirit departed from him.

Luke 9-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,
Luke 9-2 <f>ⓑ</f> and he sent them out to <f>ⓒ</f>proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal.
Luke 9-3 <f>ⓓ</f> And he said to them, <J>“Take nothing for your journey, <f>ⓔ</f>no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics. <f>[1]</f></J>
Luke 9-4 <J>And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.</J>
Luke 9-5 <J>And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town <f>ⓕ</f>shake off the dust from your feet <f>ⓖ</f>as a testimony <f>ⓗ</f>against them.”</J>
Luke 9-6 <f>ⓘ</f> And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
Luke 9-7 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Now <f>ⓚ</f>Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that <f>ⓛ</f>John had been raised from the dead,
Luke 9-8 <f>ⓜ</f> by some that Elijah had appeared, and <f>ⓝ</f>by others that one of the prophets of old had risen.
Luke 9-9 Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And <f>ⓞ</f>he sought to see him.
Luke 9-10 <pb/>On their return <f>ⓟ</f>the apostles told him all that they had done. <f>ⓠ</f>And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida.
Luke 9-11 When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he <f>ⓡ</f>welcomed them and <f>ⓢ</f>spoke to them of the kingdom of God and <f>ⓣ</f>cured those who had need of healing.
Luke 9-12 Now <f>ⓤ</f>the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, <f>ⓥ</f>“Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.”
Luke 9-13 But he said to them, <J> <f>ⓦ</f>“You give them something to eat.”</J> They said, “We have no more than <f>ⓧ</f>five loaves and two fish — unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.”
Luke 9-14 For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, <J>“Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</J>
Luke 9-15 And they did so, and had them all sit down.
Luke 9-16 And taking the five loaves and the two fish, <f>ⓨ</f>he looked up to heaven and <f>ⓩ</f>said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
Luke 9-17 And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces.
Luke 9-18 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, <J>“Who do the crowds say that I am?”</J>
Luke 9-19 And they answered, <f>ⓑ</f>“John the Baptist. But others say, <f>ⓒ</f>Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen.”
Luke 9-20 Then he said to them, <J>“But who do you say that I am?”</J> And Peter answered, <f>ⓓ</f>“The Christ of God.”
Luke 9-21 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,
Luke 9-22 <f>ⓕ</f> saying, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“The Son of Man must <f>ⓗ</f>suffer many things and <f>ⓘ</f>be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on <f>ⓙ</f>the third day be raised.”</J>
Luke 9-23 <pb/>And he said to all, <J>“If anyone would come after me, let him <f>ⓚ</f>deny himself and <f>ⓛ</f>take up his cross <f>ⓜ</f>daily and follow me.</J>
Luke 9-24 <J>For <f>ⓝ</f>whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</J>
Luke 9-25 <J><f>ⓞ</f> For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?</J>
Luke 9-26 <J>For <f>ⓟ</f>whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed <f>ⓠ</f>when he comes in <f>ⓡ</f>his glory and the glory of the Father and of <f>ⓢ</f>the holy angels.</J>
Luke 9-27 <J>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not <f>ⓣ</f>taste death <f>ⓤ</f>until they see the kingdom of God.”</J>
Luke 9-28 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him <f>ⓦ</f>Peter and John and James and <f>ⓧ</f>went up on the mountain to pray.
Luke 9-29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was <f>ⓨ</f>altered, and <f>ⓩ</f>his clothing became dazzling white.
Luke 9-30 And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah,
Luke 9-31 who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, <f>[2]</f> which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Luke 9-32 Now Peter and those who were with him <f>ⓐ</f>were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake <f>ⓑ</f>they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.
Luke 9-33 And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three <f>ⓒ</f>tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah” — <f>ⓓ</f>not knowing what he said.
Luke 9-34 As he was saying these things, <f>ⓔ</f>a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
Luke 9-35 And <f>ⓕ</f>a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, <f>ⓖ</f>my Chosen One; <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓗ</f>listen to him!”
Luke 9-36 And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. <f>ⓘ</f>And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.
Luke 9-37 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.
Luke 9-38 And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for <f>ⓚ</f>he is my only child.
Luke 9-39 And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him.
Luke 9-40 And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but <f>ⓛ</f>they could not.”
Luke 9-41 Jesus answered, <J>“O <f>ⓜ</f>faithless and twisted generation, <f>ⓝ</f>how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”</J>
Luke 9-42 While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus <f>ⓞ</f>rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and <f>ⓟ</f>gave him back to his father.
Luke 9-43 And all were astonished at <f>ⓠ</f>the majesty of God. <pb/><e>Jesus Again Foretells His Death</e> </pb> <pb/><f>ⓡ</f>But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus <f>[4]</f> said <f>ⓢ</f>to his disciples,
Luke 9-44 <J>“Let these words sink into your ears: <f>ⓣ</f>The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.”</J>
Luke 9-45 <f>ⓤ</f> But they did not understand this saying, and <f>ⓥ</f>it was concealed from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
Luke 9-46 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.
Luke 9-47 But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side
Luke 9-48 and said to them, <J> <f>ⓧ</f>“Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and <f>ⓨ</f>whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For <f>ⓩ</f>he who is least among you all is the one who is great.”</J>
Luke 9-49 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> John answered, “Master, we saw someone <f>ⓑ</f>casting out demons in your name, and <f>ⓒ</f>we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.”
Luke 9-50 But Jesus said to him, <J>“Do not stop him, <f>ⓓ</f>for the one who is not against you is for you.”</J>
Luke 9-51 <pb/>When the days drew near for <f>ⓔ</f>him to be taken up, <f>ⓕ</f>he set his face <f>ⓖ</f>to go to Jerusalem.
Luke 9-52 And <f>ⓗ</f>he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of <f>ⓘ</f>the Samaritans, to make preparations for him.
Luke 9-53 But <f>ⓙ</f>the people did not receive him, because <f>ⓚ</f>his face was set toward Jerusalem.
Luke 9-54 And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to tell <f>ⓛ</f>fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” <f>[5]</f>
Luke 9-55 But he turned and rebuked them. <f>[6]</f>
Luke 9-56 And they went on to another village.
Luke 9-57 <pb/>As they were going <f>ⓜ</f>along the road, <f>ⓝ</f>someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”
Luke 9-58 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</J>
Luke 9-59 To another he said, <J>“Follow me.”</J> But he said, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”
Luke 9-60 And Jesus <f>[7]</f> said to him, <J>“Leave <f>ⓞ</f>the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and <f>ⓟ</f>proclaim the kingdom of God.”</J>
Luke 9-61 Yet another said, “I will follow you, Lord, <f>ⓠ</f>but let me first say farewell to those at my home.”
Luke 9-62 Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓡ</f>“No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”</J>
