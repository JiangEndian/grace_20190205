3-1 <pb/>There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
3-2 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of <f>ⓑ</f>Ahinoam of Jezreel;
3-3 and his second, Chileab, of <f>ⓒ</f>Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah <f>ⓓ</f>the daughter of Talmai king of <f>ⓔ</f>Geshur;
3-4 and the fourth, <f>ⓕ</f>Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
3-5 and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
3-6 <pb/>While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
3-7 Now Saul had a concubine whose name was <f>ⓖ</f>Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, <f>ⓗ</f>“Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?”
3-8 Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, “Am I <f>ⓘ</f>a dog's head of Judah? To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David. And yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman.
3-9 <f>ⓙ</f> God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David <f>ⓚ</f>what the LORD has sworn to him,
3-10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, <f>ⓛ</f>from Dan to Beersheba.”
3-11 And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
3-12 <pb/>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, <f>[1]</f> saying, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you.”
3-13 And he said, “Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you; that is, <f>ⓜ</f>you shall not see my face unless you first bring <f>ⓝ</f>Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.”
3-14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, <f>ⓞ</f>for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”
3-15 And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish.
3-16 But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to <f>ⓟ</f>Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return.” And he returned.
3-17 <pb/>And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, “For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.
3-18 Now then bring it about, <f>ⓠ</f>for the LORD has promised David, saying, ‘By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.’”
3-19 Abner also spoke to <f>ⓡ</f>Benjamin. And then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.
3-20 <pb/>When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
3-21 And Abner said to David, “I will arise and go and <f>ⓢ</f>will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may <f>ⓣ</f>reign over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
3-22 <pb/>Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
3-23 When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace.”
3-24 Then Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone?
3-25 You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to know <f>ⓤ</f>your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.”
3-26 <pb/>When Joab came out from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know about it.
3-27 And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, <f>ⓥ</f>and there he struck him <f>ⓦ</f>in the stomach, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
3-28 Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
3-29 <f>ⓧ</f> May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house, and may the house of Joab never be without <f>ⓨ</f>one who has a discharge or who is <f>ⓩ</f>leprous or who holds a spindle or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread!”
3-30 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because <f>ⓐ</f>he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
3-31 <pb/>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, <f>ⓑ</f>“Tear your clothes and <f>ⓒ</f>put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner.” And King David followed the bier.
3-32 They buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
3-33 And the king <f>ⓓ</f>lamented for Abner, saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f>“Should Abner die <f>ⓕ</f>as a fool dies?</t>
3-34 <t>Your hands were not bound; </t><t>your feet were not fettered; </t><t>as one falls before the wicked </t><t>you have fallen.” </t> <pb/>And all the people wept again over him.
3-35 Then all the people came <f>ⓖ</f>to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day. But David swore, saying, <f>ⓗ</f>“God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else <f>ⓘ</f>till the sun goes down!”
3-36 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them, as everything that the king did pleased all the people.
3-37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king's will to put to death Abner the son of Ner.
3-38 And the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
3-39 And I was gentle today, though anointed king. <f>ⓙ</f>These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I. <f>ⓚ</f>The LORD repay the evildoer according to his wickedness!”
7-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> My son, keep my words </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>treasure up my commandments with you;</t>
7-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> keep my commandments and live; </t><t>keep my teaching as <f>ⓓ</f>the apple of your eye;</t>
7-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> bind them on your fingers; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>write them on the tablet of your heart.</t>
7-4 <t>Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” </t><t>and call insight your intimate friend,</t>
7-5 <t>to keep you from <f>ⓖ</f>the forbidden <f>[1]</f> woman, </t><t>from <f>ⓗ</f>the adulteress <f>[2]</f> with her smooth words. </t>
7-6 <pb/><t>For at <f>ⓘ</f>the window of my house </t><t>I have looked out through my lattice,</t>
7-7 <t>and I have seen among <f>ⓙ</f>the simple, </t><t>I have perceived among the youths, </t><t>a young man <f>ⓚ</f>lacking sense,</t>
7-8 <t>passing along the street <f>ⓛ</f>near her corner, </t><t>taking the road to her house</t>
7-9 <t>in <f>ⓜ</f>the twilight, in the evening, </t><t>at <f>ⓝ</f>the time of night and darkness. </t>
7-10 <pb/><t>And behold, the woman meets him, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart. <f>[3]</f></t>
7-11 <t>She is <f>ⓟ</f>loud and <f>ⓠ</f>wayward; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>her feet do not stay at home;</t>
7-12 <t>now in the street, now in the market, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>at every corner she <f>ⓣ</f>lies in wait.</t>
7-13 <t>She seizes him and kisses him, </t><t>and with <f>ⓤ</f>bold face she says to him,</t>
7-14 <t>“I had to <f>ⓥ</f>offer sacrifices, <f>[4]</f> </t><t>and today I have <f>ⓦ</f>paid my vows;</t>
7-15 <t>so now I have come out to meet you, </t><t>to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.</t>
7-16 <t>I have spread my couch with <f>ⓧ</f>coverings, </t><t>colored linens from <f>ⓨ</f>Egyptian linen;</t>
7-17 <t>I have perfumed my bed with <f>ⓩ</f>myrrh, </t><t>aloes, and <f>ⓐ</f>cinnamon.</t>
7-18 <t>Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; </t><t>let us delight ourselves with love.</t>
7-19 <t>For <f>ⓑ</f>my husband is not at home; </t><t>he has gone on a long journey;</t>
7-20 <t>he took a bag of money with him; </t><t>at full moon he will come home.” </t>
7-21 <pb/><t>With much seductive speech she persuades him; </t><t>with <f>ⓒ</f>her smooth talk she compels him.</t>
7-22 <t>All at once he follows her, </t><t>as an ox goes to the slaughter, </t><t>or as a stag is caught fast <f>[5]</f></t>
7-23 <t>till an arrow pierces its liver; </t><t>as <f>ⓓ</f>a bird rushes into a snare; </t><t>he does not know that it will cost him his life. </t>
7-24 <pb/><t>And <f>ⓔ</f>now, O sons, listen to me, </t><t>and be attentive to the words of my mouth.</t>
7-25 <t>Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; </t><t>do not stray into her paths,</t>
7-26 <t>for many a victim has she laid low, </t><t>and all her slain are <f>ⓕ</f>a mighty throng.</t>
7-27 <t>Her house is <f>ⓖ</f>the way to Sheol, </t><t>going down to the chambers of death. </t>
3-1 <pb/>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named <f>ⓐ</f>Nicodemus, <f>ⓑ</f>a ruler of the Jews.
3-2 This man came to Jesus <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>by night and said to him, <f>ⓓ</f>“Rabbi, <f>ⓔ</f>we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do <f>ⓕ</f>unless God is with him.”
3-3 Jesus answered him, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is <f>ⓖ</f>born <f>ⓗ</f>again <f>[2]</f> he cannot <f>ⓘ</f>see the kingdom of God.”</J>
3-4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?”
3-5 Jesus answered, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born <f>ⓙ</f>of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</J>
3-6 <J><f>ⓚ</f> That which is born of the flesh is <f>ⓛ</f>flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <f>[3]</f></J>
3-7 <J><f>ⓜ</f> Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You <f>[4]</f> must be born <f>ⓝ</f>again.’</J>
3-8 <J><f>ⓞ</f> The wind <f>[5]</f> blows <f>ⓟ</f>where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</J>
3-9 <pb/>Nicodemus said to him, <f>ⓠ</f>“How can these things be?”
3-10 Jesus answered him, <J>“Are you the teacher of Israel <f>ⓡ</f>and yet you do not understand these things?</J>
3-11 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓢ</f>we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but <f>ⓣ</f>you <f>[6]</f> do not receive our testimony.</J>
3-12 <J>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</J>
3-13 <J><f>ⓤ</f> No one has <f>ⓥ</f>ascended into heaven except <f>ⓦ</f>he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. <f>[7]</f></J>
3-14 <J>And <f>ⓧ</f>as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man <f>ⓨ</f>be lifted up,</J>
3-15 <J>that whoever believes <f>ⓩ</f>in him <f>ⓐ</f>may have eternal life. <f>[8]</f></J>
3-16 <pb/><J>“For <f>ⓑ</f>God so loved <f>ⓒ</f>the world, <f>[9]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not <f>ⓔ</f>perish but have eternal life.</J>
3-17 <J>For <f>ⓕ</f>God did not send his Son into the world <f>ⓖ</f>to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</J>
3-18 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not <f>ⓘ</f>believed in the name of the only Son of God.</J>
3-19 <J><f>ⓙ</f> And this is the judgment: <f>ⓚ</f>the light has come into the world, and <f>ⓛ</f>people loved the darkness rather than the light because <f>ⓜ</f>their works were evil.</J>
3-20 <J><f>ⓝ</f> For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, <f>ⓞ</f>lest his works should be exposed.</J>
3-21 <J>But whoever <f>ⓟ</f>does what is true <f>ⓠ</f>comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”</J>
3-22 <pb/>After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and <f>ⓡ</f>was baptizing.
3-23 John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized
3-24 (for <f>ⓢ</f>John had not yet been put in prison).
3-25 <pb/>Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over <f>ⓣ</f>purification.
3-26 And they came to John and said to him, <f>ⓤ</f>“Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, <f>ⓥ</f>to whom you bore witness — look, he is baptizing, and <f>ⓦ</f>all are going to him.”
3-27 John answered, <f>ⓧ</f>“A person cannot receive even one thing <f>ⓨ</f>unless it is given him <f>ⓩ</f>from heaven.
3-28 You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, <f>ⓐ</f>‘I am not the Christ, but <f>ⓑ</f>I have been sent before him.’
3-29 <f>ⓒ</f> The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. <f>ⓓ</f>The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, <f>ⓔ</f>rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete.
3-30 <f>ⓕ</f> He must increase, but I must decrease.” <f>[10]</f>
3-31 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> He who comes from above <f>ⓗ</f>is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and <f>ⓘ</f>speaks in an earthly way. <f>ⓙ</f>He who comes from heaven <f>ⓚ</f>is above all.
3-32 <f>ⓛ</f> He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, <f>ⓜ</f>yet no one receives his testimony.
3-33 Whoever receives his testimony <f>ⓝ</f>sets his seal to this, <f>ⓞ</f>that God is true.
3-34 For he whom <f>ⓟ</f>God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit <f>ⓠ</f>without measure.
3-35 <f>ⓡ</f> The Father loves the Son and <f>ⓢ</f>has given all things into his hand.
3-36 <f>ⓣ</f> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; <f>ⓤ</f>whoever does not obey the Son shall not <f>ⓥ</f>see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.
