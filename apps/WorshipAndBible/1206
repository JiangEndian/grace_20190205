18-1 <pb/>Then David mustered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
18-2 And David sent out the army, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third under the command of <f>ⓐ</f>Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, “I myself will also go out with you.”
18-3 <f>ⓑ</f> But the men said, “You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city.”
18-4 The king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.
18-5 And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” <f>ⓒ</f>And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.
18-6 <pb/>So the army went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the <f>ⓓ</f>forest of Ephraim.
18-7 And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the loss there was great on that day, twenty thousand men.
18-8 The battle spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.
18-9 <pb/>And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on.
18-10 And a certain man saw it and told Joab, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”
18-11 Joab said to the man who told him, “What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt.”
18-12 But the man said to Joab, “Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not reach out my hand against the king's son, for <f>ⓕ</f>in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘For my sake protect the young man Absalom.’
18-13 On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life <f>[2]</f> (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof.”
18-14 Joab said, “I will not waste time like this with you.” And he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak.
18-15 And ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him.
18-16 <pb/>Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained them.
18-17 And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him <f>ⓖ</f>a very great heap of stones. And all Israel <f>ⓗ</f>fled every one to his own home.
18-18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself <f>ⓘ</f>the pillar that is in <f>ⓙ</f>the King's Valley, for he said, <f>ⓚ</f>“I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's monument <f>[3]</f> to this day.
18-19 <pb/>Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, <f>ⓛ</f>“Let me run and carry news to the king that <f>ⓜ</f>the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.”
18-20 And Joab said to him, “You are not to carry news today. You may carry news another day, but today you shall carry no news, because the king's son is dead.”
18-21 Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed before Joab, and ran.
18-22 Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, “Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite.” And Joab said, “Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?”
18-23 “Come what may,” he said, “I will run.” So he said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of <f>ⓝ</f>the plain, and outran the Cushite.
18-24 <pb/>Now David <f>ⓞ</f>was sitting between the two gates, and <f>ⓟ</f>the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he lifted up his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone.
18-25 The watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” And he drew nearer and nearer.
18-26 The watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the gate and said, “See, another man running alone!” The king said, “He also brings news.”
18-27 The watchman said, “I think the running of the first is <f>ⓠ</f>like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, <f>ⓡ</f>“He is a good man and comes with good news.”
18-28 <pb/>Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, “All is well.” And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth and said, <f>ⓢ</f>“Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.”
18-29 And the king said, <f>ⓣ</f>“Is it well with the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king's servant, your servant, I saw a great commotion, but I do not know what it was.”
18-30 And the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and stood still.
18-31 <pb/>And behold, the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, “Good news for my lord the king! For <f>ⓤ</f>the LORD has delivered you this day from the hand of all who rose up against you.”
18-32 The king said to the Cushite, <f>ⓥ</f>“Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And the Cushite answered, <f>ⓦ</f>“May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be like that young man.”
18-33 <f>[4]</f> And the king was deeply moved and went up <f>ⓧ</f>to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he went, he said, <f>ⓨ</f>“O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”
22-1 <pb/><t><pb/><f>ⓐ</f> A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, </t><t>and favor is better than silver or gold.</t>
22-2 <t><f>ⓑ</f> The rich and the poor meet together; </t><t>the LORD is <f>ⓒ</f>the Maker of them all.</t>
22-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> The prudent sees danger and hides himself, </t><t>but the simple go on and suffer for it.</t>
22-4 <t>The reward for humility and fear of the LORD </t><t>is <f>ⓔ</f>riches and honor and life. <f>[1]</f></t>
22-5 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked; </t><t>whoever <f>ⓖ</f>guards his soul will keep far from them.</t>
22-6 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Train up a child in the way he should go; </t><t>even when he is old he will not depart from it.</t>
22-7 <t><f>ⓘ</f> The rich rules over the poor, </t><t>and the borrower is the slave of the lender.</t>
22-8 <t>Whoever <f>ⓙ</f>sows injustice will reap calamity, </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>the rod of his fury will fail.</t>
22-9 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Whoever has a bountiful <f>[2]</f> eye will be blessed, </t><t>for he <f>ⓜ</f>shares his bread with the poor.</t>
22-10 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Drive out a scoffer, <f>ⓞ</f>and strife will go out, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>quarreling and abuse will cease.</t>
22-11 <t>He who <f>ⓠ</f>loves purity of heart, </t><t>and whose <f>ⓡ</f>speech is gracious, <f>ⓢ</f>will have the king as his friend.</t>
22-12 <t>The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge, </t><t>but he <f>ⓣ</f>overthrows the words of the traitor.</t>
22-13 <t><f>ⓤ</f> The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside! </t><t>I shall be killed in the streets!”</t>
22-14 <t>The mouth of <f>ⓥ</f>forbidden <f>[3]</f> women is <f>ⓦ</f>a deep pit; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>he with whom the LORD is angry will fall into it.</t>
22-15 <t>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, </t><t>but <f>ⓨ</f>the rod of discipline drives it far from him.</t>
22-16 <t>Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, </t><t>or gives to the rich, <f>ⓩ</f>will only come to poverty. </t>
22-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Incline your ear, and hear <f>ⓑ</f>the words of the wise, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and apply your heart to my knowledge,</t>

22-24 <t>Make no friendship with a man given to anger, </t><t>nor go with a wrathful man,</t>

22-26 <t>Be not one of those who <f>ⓙ</f>give pledges, </t><t>who put up security for debts.</t>
22-27 <t>If you have nothing with which to pay, </t><t>why should <f>ⓚ</f>your bed be taken from under you?</t>
22-28 <t>Do not move the ancient <f>ⓛ</f>landmark </t><t>that your fathers have set.</t>
22-29 <t>Do you see a man skillful in his work? </t><t>He will <f>ⓜ</f>stand before kings; </t><t>he will not stand before obscure men. </t>
18-1 <pb/>When Jesus had spoken these words, <f>ⓐ</f>he went out with his disciples across <f>ⓑ</f>the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
18-2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew <f>ⓒ</f>the place, for <f>ⓓ</f>Jesus often met there with his disciples.
18-3 <f>ⓔ</f> So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
18-4 Then Jesus, <f>ⓕ</f>knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Whom do you seek?”</J>
18-5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, <J>“I am he.” <f>[1]</f></J> Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
18-6 <f>ⓗ</f> When Jesus <f>[2]</f> said to them, <J>“I am he,”</J> they drew back and fell to the ground.
18-7 So he asked them again, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“Whom do you seek?”</J> And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
18-8 Jesus answered, <J>“I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.”</J>
18-9 <f>ⓙ</f> This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: <J>“Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.”</J>
18-10 Then Simon Peter, <f>ⓚ</f>having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant <f>[3]</f> and cut off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)
18-11 So Jesus said to Peter, <J>“Put your sword into its sheath; <f>ⓛ</f>shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?”</J>
18-12 <pb/>So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews <f>[4]</f> arrested Jesus and bound him.
18-13 First they <f>ⓜ</f>led him to <f>ⓝ</f>Annas, for he was the father-in-law of <f>ⓞ</f>Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
18-14 It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews <f>ⓟ</f>that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.
18-15 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,
18-16 <f>ⓡ</f> but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in.
18-17 <f>ⓢ</f> The servant girl at the door said to Peter, “You also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.”
18-18 Now the servants <f>[5]</f> and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. <f>ⓣ</f>Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
18-19 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
18-20 Jesus answered him, <J>“I have spoken <f>ⓥ</f>openly <f>ⓦ</f>to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. <f>ⓧ</f>I have said nothing in secret.</J>
18-21 <J>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.”</J>
18-22 When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, <f>ⓨ</f>“Is that how you answer the high priest?”
18-23 Jesus answered him, <J>“If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?”</J>
18-24 <f>ⓩ</f> Annas then sent him bound to <f>ⓐ</f>Caiaphas the high priest.
18-25 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, “You also are not one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”
18-26 One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of <f>ⓒ</f>the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you <f>ⓓ</f>in the garden with him?”
18-27 Peter again denied it, and <f>ⓔ</f>at once a rooster crowed.
18-28 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Then they led Jesus <f>ⓖ</f>from the house of Caiaphas to <f>ⓗ</f>the governor's headquarters. <f>[6]</f> It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor's headquarters, <f>ⓘ</f>so that they would not be defiled, <f>ⓙ</f>but could eat the Passover.
18-29 <f>ⓚ</f> So Pilate went outside to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”
18-30 They answered him, “If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.”
18-31 Pilate said to them, <f>ⓛ</f>“Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.”
18-32 <f>ⓜ</f> This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken <f>ⓝ</f>to show by what kind of death he was going to die.
18-33 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, <f>ⓟ</f>“Are you the King of the Jews?”
18-34 Jesus answered, <J>“Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?”</J>
18-35 Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?”
18-36 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“My kingdom <f>ⓡ</f>is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, <f>ⓢ</f>my servants would have been fighting, that <f>ⓣ</f>I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”</J>
18-37 Then Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“You say that I am a king. <f>ⓥ</f>For this purpose I was born and for this purpose <f>ⓦ</f>I have come into the world — <f>ⓧ</f>to bear witness to the truth. <f>ⓨ</f>Everyone who is <f>ⓩ</f>of the truth <f>ⓐ</f>listens to my voice.”</J>
18-38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?” <pb/>After he had said this, <f>ⓑ</f>he went back outside to the Jews and told them, <f>ⓒ</f>“I find no guilt in him.
18-39 <f>ⓓ</f> But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
18-40 They cried out again, <f>ⓔ</f>“Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber. <f>[7]</f>
