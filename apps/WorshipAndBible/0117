2 Kings 14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the <f>ⓑ</f>second year of Joash the son of Joahaz, king of Israel, <f>ⓒ</f>Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, began to reign.
2 Kings 14-2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
2 Kings 14-3 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not like David his father. He did in all things as Joash his father had done.
2 Kings 14-4 <f>ⓓ</f> But the high places were not removed; <f>ⓔ</f>the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places.
2 Kings 14-5 And as soon as the royal power was <f>ⓕ</f>firmly in his hand, he struck down his servants <f>ⓖ</f>who had struck down the king his father.
2 Kings 14-6 But he did not put to death the children of the murderers, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, <f>ⓗ</f>“Fathers shall not be put to death because of their children, nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers. But each one shall die for his own sin.”
2 Kings 14-7 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> He struck down ten thousand Edomites in <f>ⓙ</f>the Valley of Salt and took <f>ⓚ</f>Sela by storm, and called it <f>ⓛ</f>Joktheel, which is its name to this day.
2 Kings 14-8 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash <f>[1]</f> the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, <f>ⓝ</f>let us look one another in the face.”
2 Kings 14-9 And Jehoash king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, <f>ⓞ</f>“A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife,’ and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.
2 Kings 14-10 You have indeed <f>ⓟ</f>struck down Edom, <f>ⓠ</f>and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home, for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?”
2 Kings 14-11 <pb/>But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah <f>ⓡ</f>faced one another in battle at <f>ⓢ</f>Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
2 Kings 14-12 And Judah was defeated by Israel, <f>ⓣ</f>and every man fled to his home.
2 Kings 14-13 And Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, <f>[2]</f> from <f>ⓤ</f>the Ephraim Gate to <f>ⓥ</f>the Corner Gate.
2 Kings 14-14 And he seized <f>ⓦ</f>all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king's house, also hostages, and he returned to Samaria.
2 Kings 14-15 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash that he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14-16 And Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel, and Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings 14-17 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
2 Kings 14-18 Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 14-19 And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to <f>ⓩ</f>Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there.
2 Kings 14-20 And they brought him on horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
2 Kings 14-21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
2 Kings 14-22 He built <f>ⓐ</f>Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
2 Kings 14-23 <pb/>In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years.
2 Kings 14-24 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓑ</f>which he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings 14-25 <f>ⓒ</f> He restored the border of Israel <f>ⓓ</f>from Lebo-hamath as far as the Sea of <f>ⓔ</f>the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant <f>ⓕ</f>Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from <f>ⓖ</f>Gath-hepher.
2 Kings 14-26 For the LORD <f>ⓗ</f>saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, <f>ⓘ</f>for there was none left, bond or free, and there was none to help Israel.
2 Kings 14-27 <f>ⓙ</f> But the LORD had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, so he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
2 Kings 14-28 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did, and his might, how he fought, and how he restored <f>ⓚ</f>Damascus and <f>ⓛ</f>Hamath to Judah in Israel, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14-29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel, and Zechariah his son reigned in his place.

Isaiah 13-5 <t><f>ⓖ</f> They come from a distant land, </t><t>from the end of the heavens, </t><t>the LORD and the weapons of his indignation, </t><t>to destroy the whole land. <f>[2]</f> </t>

Isaiah 13-9 <pb/><t>Behold, <f>ⓜ</f>the day of the LORD comes, </t><t>cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, </t><t>to make the land a desolation </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>to destroy its sinners from it.</t>
Isaiah 13-10 <t><f>ⓞ</f> For the stars of the heavens and their constellations </t><t>will not give their light; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>the sun will be dark at its rising, </t><t>and the moon will not shed its light.</t>
Isaiah 13-11 <t>I will punish <f>ⓠ</f>the world for its evil, </t><t>and the wicked for their iniquity; </t><t>I will <f>ⓡ</f>put an end to the pomp of the arrogant, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>and lay low the pompous pride of the ruthless.</t>
Isaiah 13-12 <t>I will make <f>ⓣ</f>people more rare than fine gold, </t><t>and mankind than the <f>ⓤ</f>gold of Ophir.</t>
Isaiah 13-13 <t>Therefore <f>ⓥ</f>I will make the heavens tremble, </t><t>and the earth will be shaken out of its place, </t><t>at the wrath of the LORD of hosts </t><t>in the day of his fierce anger.</t>
Isaiah 13-14 <t>And like a hunted gazelle, </t><t>or like sheep with none to gather them, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>each will turn to his own people, </t><t>and each will flee to his own land.</t>

Isaiah 13-17 <pb/><t>Behold, <f>ⓨ</f>I am stirring up the Medes against them, </t><t>who have no regard for silver </t><t>and do not delight in gold.</t>
Isaiah 13-18 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Their bows will slaughter <f>[4]</f> the young men; </t><t>they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; </t><t>their eyes will not pity children.</t>
Isaiah 13-19 <t>And Babylon, <f>ⓐ</f>the glory of kingdoms, </t><t>the splendor and pomp of the Chaldeans, </t><t>will be <f>ⓑ</f>like Sodom and Gomorrah </t><t>when God overthrew them.</t>
Isaiah 13-20 <t><f>ⓒ</f> It will never be inhabited </t><t>or lived in for all generations; </t><t>no <f>ⓓ</f>Arab will pitch his tent there; </t><t>no <f>ⓔ</f>shepherds will make their flocks lie down there.</t>
Isaiah 13-21 <t>But <f>ⓕ</f>wild animals will lie down there, </t><t>and their houses will be full of howling creatures; </t><t>there <f>ⓖ</f>ostriches <f>[5]</f> will dwell, </t><t>and there wild goats will dance.</t>
Isaiah 13-22 <t>Hyenas <f>[6]</f> will cry in its towers, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>jackals in <f>ⓘ</f>the pleasant palaces; </t><t>its time is close at hand </t><t>and its days will not be prolonged. </t>
Romans 11-1 <pb/>I ask, then, <f>ⓐ</f>has God rejected his people? By no means! For <f>ⓑ</f>I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, <f>[1]</f> a member of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans 11-2 <f>ⓒ</f> God has not rejected his people whom he <f>ⓓ</f>foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?
Romans 11-3 <f>ⓔ</f> “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.”
Romans 11-4 But what is God's reply to him? <f>ⓕ</f>“I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
Romans 11-5 So too at the present time there is <f>ⓖ</f>a remnant, chosen by grace.
Romans 11-6 <f>ⓗ</f> But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
Romans 11-7 <pb/>What then? <f>ⓘ</f>Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest <f>ⓙ</f>were hardened,
Romans 11-8 as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“God gave them a spirit of stupor, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>eyes that would not see </t><t>and ears that would not hear, </t><t>down to this very day.” </t>
Romans 11-9 <pb/>And David says, <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“Let their table become a snare and a trap, </t><t>a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</t>
Romans 11-10 <t>let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, </t><t>and bend their backs forever.” </t>
Romans 11-11 <pb/>So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather, through their trespass <f>ⓝ</f>salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.
Romans 11-12 Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion <f>[2]</f> mean!
Romans 11-13 <pb/>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as <f>ⓞ</f>I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry
Romans 11-14 in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and <f>ⓟ</f>thus save some of them.
Romans 11-15 For if their rejection means <f>ⓠ</f>the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
Romans 11-16 <f>ⓡ</f> If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
Romans 11-17 <pb/>But if <f>ⓢ</f>some of the branches were broken off, and you, <f>ⓣ</f>although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root <f>[3]</f> of the olive tree,
Romans 11-18 do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.
Romans 11-19 Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”
Romans 11-20 That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you <f>ⓤ</f>stand fast through faith. So <f>ⓥ</f>do not become proud, but <f>ⓦ</f>fear.
Romans 11-21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
Romans 11-22 Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, <f>ⓧ</f>provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise <f>ⓨ</f>you too will be cut off.
Romans 11-23 And <f>ⓩ</f>even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
Romans 11-24 For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.
Romans 11-25 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>a partial hardening has come upon Israel, <f>ⓒ</f>until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
Romans 11-26 And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“The Deliverer will come <f>ⓔ</f>from Zion, </t><t>he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”;</t>
Romans 11-27 <t>“and this will be my <f>ⓕ</f>covenant with them </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>when I take away their sins.” </t>
Romans 11-28 <pb/>As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are <f>ⓗ</f>beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
Romans 11-29 For the gifts and <f>ⓘ</f>the calling of God are irrevocable.
Romans 11-30 For just as <f>ⓙ</f>you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,
Romans 11-31 so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now <f>[5]</f> receive mercy.
Romans 11-32 For God <f>ⓚ</f>has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.
Romans 11-33 <pb/>Oh, the depth of the riches and <f>ⓛ</f>wisdom and knowledge of God! <f>ⓜ</f>How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
Romans 11-34 <pb/><t>“For <f>ⓝ</f>who has known the mind of the Lord, </t><t>or <f>ⓞ</f>who has been his counselor?”</t>
Romans 11-35 <t>“Or <f>ⓟ</f>who has given a gift to him </t><t>that he might be repaid?” </t>
Romans 11-36 <pb/>For <f>ⓠ</f>from him and through him and to him are all things. <f>ⓡ</f>To him be glory forever. Amen.
