8-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they accused him fiercely.
8-2 And he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not <f>ⓑ</f>the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?
8-3 <f>ⓒ</f> God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?” <f>ⓓ</f>Then their anger <f>[1]</f> against him subsided when he said this.
8-4 <pb/>And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and <f>ⓔ</f>the 300 men who were with him, exhausted yet pursuing.
8-5 So he said to the men of <f>ⓕ</f>Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
8-6 And the officials of Succoth said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, <f>ⓗ</f>that we should give bread to your army?”
8-7 So Gideon said, “Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, <f>ⓘ</f>I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.”
8-8 And from there he went up to <f>ⓙ</f>Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
8-9 And he said to the men of Penuel, <f>ⓚ</f>“When I come again in peace, <f>ⓛ</f>I will break down this tower.”
8-10 <pb/>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of <f>ⓜ</f>the people of the East, for there had fallen 120,000 men <f>ⓝ</f>who drew the sword.
8-11 And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers east of <f>ⓞ</f>Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the army, for the army felt <f>ⓟ</f>secure.
8-12 And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them <f>ⓠ</f>and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic.
8-13 <pb/>Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.
8-14 And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men.
8-15 And he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, <f>ⓡ</f>‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?’”
8-16 And he took the elders of the city, and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson.
8-17 <f>ⓢ</f> And he broke down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
8-18 <pb/>Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “Where are the men whom you killed at <f>ⓣ</f>Tabor?” They answered, “As you are, so were they. Every one of them resembled the son of a king.”
8-19 And he said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. <f>ⓤ</f>As the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.”
8-20 So he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise and kill them!” But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a young man.
8-21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength.” And Gideon arose and <f>ⓥ</f>killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took <f>ⓦ</f>the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
8-22 <pb/>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.”
8-23 Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; <f>ⓧ</f>the LORD will rule over you.”
8-24 And Gideon said to them, “Let me make a request of you: every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil.” (For they had golden earrings, <f>ⓨ</f>because they were Ishmaelites.)
8-25 And they answered, “We will willingly give them.” And they spread a cloak, and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil.
8-26 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels <f>[2]</f> of gold, besides <f>ⓩ</f>the crescent ornaments and <f>ⓐ</f>the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels.
8-27 And Gideon <f>ⓑ</f>made an ephod of it and put it in his city, <f>ⓒ</f>in Ophrah. And all Israel <f>ⓓ</f>whored after it there, and it became a <f>ⓔ</f>snare to Gideon and to his family.
8-28 So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they raised their heads no more. <f>ⓕ</f>And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
8-29 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.
8-30 Now Gideon had <f>ⓗ</f>seventy sons, his own offspring, <f>[3]</f> for he had many wives.
8-31 And his concubine <f>ⓘ</f>who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
8-32 And Gideon the son of Joash died <f>ⓙ</f>in a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, <f>ⓚ</f>at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
8-33 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and <f>ⓜ</f>whored after the Baals and made <f>ⓝ</f>Baal-berith their god.
8-34 And the people of Israel <f>ⓞ</f>did not remember the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies on every side,
8-35 <f>ⓟ</f> and they did not show steadfast love to the family of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel.
106-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Praise the LORD! </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>Oh give thanks to the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>for he is good, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>for his steadfast love endures forever!</t>
106-2 <t>Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD, </t><t>or declare all his praise?</t>
106-3 <t>Blessed are they who observe justice, </t><t>who <f>ⓔ</f>do righteousness at all times! </t>
106-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people; </t><t>help me when you save them, <f>[1]</f></t>
106-5 <t>that I may look upon the prosperity of your <f>ⓖ</f>chosen ones, </t><t>that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, </t><t>that I may glory with your inheritance. </t>
106-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> Both we and <f>ⓘ</f>our fathers have sinned; </t><t>we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness.</t>
106-7 <t>Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, </t><t>did not consider your wondrous works; </t><t>they <f>ⓙ</f>did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, </t><t>but <f>ⓚ</f>rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.</t>
106-8 <t>Yet he saved them <f>ⓛ</f>for his name's sake, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>that he might make known his mighty power.</t>
106-9 <t>He <f>ⓝ</f>rebuked the Red Sea, and it <f>ⓞ</f>became dry, </t><t>and he <f>ⓟ</f>led them through the deep as through a desert.</t>
106-10 <t>So he <f>ⓠ</f>saved them from the hand of the foe </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>redeemed them from the power of the enemy.</t>
106-11 <t>And <f>ⓢ</f>the waters covered their adversaries; </t><t>not one of them was left.</t>
106-12 <t>Then <f>ⓣ</f>they believed his words; </t><t>they <f>ⓤ</f>sang his praise. </t>
106-13 <pb/><t>But they soon <f>ⓥ</f>forgot his works; </t><t>they did not wait for <f>ⓦ</f>his counsel.</t>
106-14 <t>But they had <f>ⓧ</f>a wanton craving in the wilderness, </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>put God to the test in the desert;</t>
106-15 <t>he <f>ⓩ</f>gave them what they asked, </t><t>but sent <f>ⓐ</f>a wasting disease among them. </t>
106-16 <pb/><t>When men in the camp <f>ⓑ</f>were jealous of Moses </t><t>and Aaron, <f>ⓒ</f>the holy one of the LORD,</t>
106-17 <t><f>ⓓ</f> the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, </t><t>and covered the company of Abiram.</t>
106-18 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Fire also broke out in their company; </t><t>the flame burned up the wicked. </t>
106-19 <pb/><t>They <f>ⓕ</f>made a calf in Horeb </t><t>and worshiped a metal image.</t>
106-20 <t>They <f>ⓖ</f>exchanged the glory of God <f>[2]</f> </t><t>for the image of an ox that eats grass.</t>
106-21 <t>They <f>ⓗ</f>forgot God, their Savior, </t><t>who had done great things in Egypt,</t>
106-22 <t>wondrous works in <f>ⓘ</f>the land of Ham, </t><t>and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</t>
106-23 <t>Therefore <f>ⓙ</f>he said he would destroy them — </t><t>had not Moses, his <f>ⓚ</f>chosen one, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>stood in the breach before him, </t><t>to turn away his wrath from destroying them. </t>
106-24 <pb/><t>Then they <f>ⓜ</f>despised <f>ⓝ</f>the pleasant land, </t><t>having <f>ⓞ</f>no faith in his promise.</t>
106-25 <t>They <f>ⓟ</f>murmured in their tents, </t><t>and did not obey the voice of the LORD.</t>
106-26 <t>Therefore he <f>ⓠ</f>raised his hand and swore to them </t><t>that he would make them fall in the wilderness,</t>
106-27 <t>and would make their offspring fall among the nations, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>scattering them among the lands. </t>
106-28 <pb/><t>Then they <f>ⓢ</f>yoked themselves to the <f>ⓣ</f>Baal of Peor, </t><t>and ate sacrifices offered to <f>ⓤ</f>the dead;</t>
106-29 <t>they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, </t><t>and a plague broke out among them.</t>
106-30 <t>Then <f>ⓥ</f>Phinehas stood up and intervened, </t><t>and the plague was stayed.</t>
106-31 <t>And that was <f>ⓦ</f>counted to him as righteousness </t><t>from generation to generation forever. </t>
106-32 <pb/><t>They <f>ⓧ</f>angered him at the waters of Meribah, </t><t>and it went ill with Moses on their account,</t>
106-33 <t>for they <f>ⓨ</f>made his spirit bitter, <f>[3]</f> </t><t>and he <f>ⓩ</f>spoke rashly with his lips. </t>
106-34 <pb/><t>They did not <f>ⓐ</f>destroy the peoples, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>as the LORD commanded them,</t>
106-35 <t>but they <f>ⓒ</f>mixed with the nations </t><t>and learned to do as they did.</t>
106-36 <t>They served their idols, </t><t>which became <f>ⓓ</f>a snare to them.</t>
106-37 <t>They <f>ⓔ</f>sacrificed their sons </t><t>and their daughters to <f>ⓕ</f>the demons;</t>
106-38 <t>they poured out innocent blood, </t><t>the blood of their sons and daughters, </t><t>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, </t><t>and the land was <f>ⓖ</f>polluted with blood.</t>
106-39 <t>Thus they <f>ⓗ</f>became unclean by their acts, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>played the whore in their deeds. </t>
106-40 <pb/><t>Then <f>ⓙ</f>the anger of the LORD was kindled against <f>ⓚ</f>his people, </t><t>and he abhorred his <f>ⓛ</f>heritage;</t>
106-41 <t>he <f>ⓜ</f>gave them into the hand of the nations, </t><t>so that those who hated them ruled over them.</t>
106-42 <t>Their enemies <f>ⓝ</f>oppressed them, </t><t>and they were brought into subjection under their power.</t>
106-43 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Many times he delivered them, </t><t>but they were rebellious in their <f>ⓟ</f>purposes </t><t>and were <f>ⓠ</f>brought low through their iniquity. </t>
106-44 <pb/><t>Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, </t><t>when he <f>ⓡ</f>heard their cry.</t>
106-45 <t>For their sake he <f>ⓢ</f>remembered his covenant, </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>relented according to <f>ⓤ</f>the abundance of his steadfast love.</t>
106-46 <t>He caused them to be <f>ⓥ</f>pitied </t><t>by all those who held them captive. </t>
106-47 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> Save us, O LORD our God, </t><t>and <f>ⓧ</f>gather us from among the nations, </t><t>that we may give thanks to your holy name </t><t>and glory in your praise. </t>
106-48 <pb/><t><f>ⓨ</f> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, </t><t>from everlasting to everlasting! </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>And let all the people say, “Amen!” </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>Praise the LORD! </t>
20-1 <pb/><J>“For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</J>
20-2 <J>After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius <f>[1]</f> a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</J>
20-3 <J>And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</J>
20-4 <J>and to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.’</J>
20-5 <J>So they went.</J> <J>Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same.</J>
20-6 <J>And <f>ⓐ</f>about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, ‘Why do you stand here idle all day?’</J>
20-7 <J>They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’</J>
20-8 <J>And <f>ⓑ</f>when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his <f>ⓒ</f>foreman, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.’</J>
20-9 <J>And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.</J>
20-10 <J>Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.</J>
20-11 <J>And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house,</J>
20-12 <J>saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and <f>ⓓ</f>the scorching heat.’</J>
20-13 <J>But he replied to one of them, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</J>
20-14 <J>Take <f>ⓕ</f>what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you.</J>
20-15 <J><f>ⓖ</f> Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or <f>ⓗ</f>do you begrudge my generosity?’ <f>[2]</f></J>
20-16 <J>So <f>ⓘ</f>the last will be first, and the first last.”</J>
20-17 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
20-18 <J>“See, <f>ⓚ</f>we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will <f>ⓛ</f>condemn him to death</J>
20-19 <J>and <f>ⓜ</f>deliver him over to the Gentiles <f>ⓝ</f>to be mocked and flogged and <f>ⓞ</f>crucified, and he will be raised on <f>ⓟ</f>the third day.”</J>
20-20 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then <f>ⓡ</f>the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and <f>ⓢ</f>kneeling before him she asked him for something.
20-21 And he said to her, <J>“What do you want?”</J> She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine <f>ⓣ</f>are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, <f>ⓤ</f>in your kingdom.”
20-22 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“You do not know what you are asking. Are you able <f>ⓦ</f>to drink the cup that I am to drink?”</J> They said to him, “We are able.”
20-23 He said to them, <J> <f>ⓧ</f>“You will drink <f>ⓨ</f>my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, <f>ⓩ</f>but it is for those for whom it has been <f>ⓐ</f>prepared by my Father.”</J>
20-24 And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers.
20-25 But Jesus called them to him and said, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles <f>ⓒ</f>lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</J>
20-26 <J><f>ⓓ</f> It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, <f>[3]</f></J>
20-27 <J>and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, <f>[4]</f></J>
20-28 <J>even as the Son of Man came not to be served but <f>ⓔ</f>to serve, and <f>ⓕ</f>to give his life as a ransom for <f>ⓖ</f>many.”</J>
20-29 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
20-30 And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, <f>[5]</f> have mercy on us, <f>ⓘ</f>Son of David!”
20-31 The crowd <f>ⓙ</f>rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
20-32 And stopping, Jesus called them and said, <J>“What do you want me to do for you?”</J>
20-33 They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”
20-34 And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him.
