23-1 <pb/>And Balaam said to Balak, <f>ⓐ</f>“Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”
23-2 Balak did as Balaam had said. And Balak and Balaam <f>ⓑ</f>offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
23-3 And Balaam said to Balak, <f>ⓒ</f>“Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come <f>ⓓ</f>to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell you.” And he went to a bare height,
23-4 <f>ⓔ</f> and God met Balaam. And Balaam said to him, “I have arranged the seven altars and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.”
23-5 And the LORD <f>ⓕ</f>put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”
23-6 And he returned to him, and behold, he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering.
23-7 And Balaam <f>ⓖ</f>took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“From <f>ⓗ</f>Aram Balak has brought me, </t><t>the king of Moab <f>ⓘ</f>from the eastern mountains: </t><t>‘Come, <f>ⓙ</f>curse Jacob for me, </t><t>and come, denounce Israel!’</t>
23-8 <t>How can I curse whom God has not cursed? </t><t>How can I denounce whom the LORD has not denounced?</t>
23-9 <t>For from the top of the crags <f>ⓚ</f>I see him, </t><t>from the hills I behold him; </t><t>behold, <f>ⓛ</f>a people dwelling alone, </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>not counting itself among the nations!</t>
23-10 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Who can count the dust of Jacob </t><t>or number the fourth part <f>[1]</f> of Israel? </t><t>Let me die <f>ⓞ</f>the death of the upright, </t><t>and let my end be like his!” </t>
23-11 <pb/>And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? <f>ⓟ</f>I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have done nothing but bless them.”
23-12 And he answered and said, <f>ⓠ</f>“Must I not take care to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?”
23-13 <pb/>And Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, from which you may see them. You shall see only a fraction of them and shall not see them all. Then curse them for me from there.”
23-14 And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, <f>ⓡ</f>and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
23-15 Balaam said to Balak, <f>ⓢ</f>“Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I meet the LORD over there.”
23-16 And the LORD met Balaam and <f>ⓣ</f>put a word in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.”
23-17 And he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the LORD spoken?”
23-18 And Balaam took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“Rise, Balak, and hear; </t><t>give ear to me, O son of Zippor:</t>
23-19 <t><f>ⓤ</f> God is not man, that he should lie, </t><t>or a son of man, that he should change his mind. </t><t>Has he said, and will he not do it? </t><t>Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?</t>
23-20 <t>Behold, I received a command to bless: </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>he has blessed, and <f>ⓦ</f>I cannot revoke it.</t>
23-21 <t><f>ⓧ</f> He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob, </t><t>nor has he seen trouble in Israel. </t><t>The LORD their God is with them, </t><t>and the shout of a king is among them.</t>
23-22 <t><f>ⓨ</f> God brings them out of Egypt </t><t>and is for them like <f>ⓩ</f>the horns of the wild ox.</t>
23-23 <t>For there is no enchantment against Jacob, </t><t>no <f>ⓐ</f>divination against Israel; </t><t>now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>‘What has God wrought!’</t>
23-24 <t>Behold, a people! <f>ⓒ</f>As a lioness it rises up </t><t>and as a lion it lifts itself; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>it does not lie down until it has devoured the prey </t><t>and drunk the blood of the slain.” </t>
23-25 <pb/>And Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all.”
23-26 But Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell you, <f>ⓔ</f>‘All that the LORD says, that I must do’?”
23-27 And Balak said to Balaam, <f>ⓕ</f>“Come now, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”
23-28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of <f>ⓖ</f>Peor, which overlooks <f>ⓗ</f>the desert. <f>[2]</f>
23-29 And Balaam said to Balak, <f>ⓘ</f>“Build for me here seven altars and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”
23-30 <f>ⓙ</f> And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
27-1 <pb/><t>The LORD is my <f>ⓐ</f>light and my <f>ⓑ</f>salvation; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>whom shall I fear? </t><t>The LORD is the stronghold <f>[1]</f> of my life; </t><t>of whom shall I be afraid? </t>
27-2 <pb/><t>When evildoers assail me </t><t>to <f>ⓓ</f>eat up my flesh, </t><t>my adversaries and foes, </t><t>it is they who stumble and fall. </t>
27-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> Though an army encamp against me, </t><t>my heart shall not fear; </t><t>though war arise against me, </t><t>yet <f>[2]</f> I will be confident. </t>
27-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> One thing have I asked of the LORD, </t><t>that will I seek after: </t><t>that I may <f>ⓖ</f>dwell in the house of the LORD </t><t>all the days of my life, </t><t>to gaze upon <f>ⓗ</f>the beauty of the LORD </t><t>and to inquire <f>[3]</f> in his temple. </t>
27-5 <pb/><t>For he will <f>ⓘ</f>hide me in his shelter </t><t>in the day of trouble; </t><t>he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; </t><t>he will <f>ⓙ</f>lift me high upon a rock. </t>
27-6 <pb/><t>And now my <f>ⓚ</f>head shall be lifted up </t><t>above my enemies all around me, </t><t>and I will offer in his tent </t><t>sacrifices with shouts of <f>ⓛ</f>joy; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>I will sing and make melody to the LORD. </t>
27-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud; </t><t>be gracious to me and answer me!</t>
27-8 <t>You have said, <f>ⓞ</f>“Seek <f>[4]</f> my face.” </t><t>My heart says to you, </t><t>“Your face, LORD, do I seek.” <f>[5]</f></t>
27-9 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Hide not your face from me. </t><t>Turn not your servant away in anger, </t><t>O you who have been my help. </t><t>Cast me not off; forsake me not, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>O God of my salvation!</t>
27-10 <t>For <f>ⓡ</f>my father and my mother have forsaken me, </t><t>but the LORD will <f>ⓢ</f>take me in. </t>
27-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> Teach me your way, O LORD, </t><t>and lead me on <f>ⓤ</f>a level path </t><t>because of my enemies.</t>
27-12 <t><f>ⓥ</f> Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; </t><t>for <f>ⓦ</f>false witnesses have risen against me, </t><t>and they <f>ⓧ</f>breathe out violence. </t>
27-13 <pb/><t>I believe that I shall look <f>[6]</f> upon <f>ⓨ</f>the goodness of the LORD </t><t>in <f>ⓩ</f>the land of the living!</t>
27-14 <t><f>ⓐ</f> Wait for the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>be strong, and let your heart take courage; </t><t>wait for the LORD! </t>
8-1 <pb/><t>Set <f>ⓐ</f>the trumpet to your lips! </t><t>One <f>ⓑ</f>like a vulture is over the house of the LORD, </t><t>because <f>ⓒ</f>they have transgressed my covenant </t><t>and rebelled against my law.</t>
8-2 <t>To me they cry, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>“My God, we — Israel — know you.”</t>
8-3 <t>Israel has spurned the good; </t><t>the enemy shall pursue him. </t>
8-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> They made kings, <f>ⓕ</f>but not through me. </t><t>They set up princes, but I knew it not. </t><t>With their silver and gold they made idols </t><t>for their own destruction.</t>
8-5 <t><f>ⓖ</f> I have <f>[1]</f> spurned your calf, O Samaria. </t><t>My anger burns against them. </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>How long will they be incapable of innocence?</t>
8-6 <t>For it is from Israel; </t><t>a craftsman made it; </t><t>it is not God. </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>The calf of Samaria </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>shall be broken to pieces. <f>[2]</f> </t>
8-7 <pb/><t>For <f>ⓚ</f>they sow the wind, </t><t>and they shall reap the whirlwind. </t><t>The standing grain has no heads; </t><t>it shall yield no flour; </t><t>if it were to yield, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>strangers would devour it.</t>
8-8 <t><f>ⓜ</f> Israel is swallowed up; </t><t>already they are among the nations </t><t>as <f>ⓝ</f>a useless vessel.</t>
8-9 <t>For <f>ⓞ</f>they have gone up to Assyria, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>a wild donkey wandering alone; </t><t>Ephraim has hired lovers.</t>
8-10 <t>Though they hire allies among the nations, </t><t>I will soon gather them up. </t><t>And <f>ⓠ</f>the king and princes <f>ⓡ</f>shall soon writhe </t><t>because of the tribute. </t>
8-11 <pb/><t>Because Ephraim <f>ⓢ</f>has multiplied altars for sinning, </t><t>they have become to him altars for sinning.</t>
8-12 <t><f>ⓣ</f> Were I to write for him my laws by the ten thousands, </t><t>they would be regarded as a strange thing.</t>
8-13 <t>As for my sacrificial offerings, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>they sacrifice meat and eat it, </t><t>but the LORD does not accept them. </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>Now he will remember their iniquity </t><t>and punish their sins; </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>they shall return to Egypt.</t>
8-14 <t>For <f>ⓧ</f>Israel has forgotten <f>ⓨ</f>his Maker </t><t>and <f>ⓩ</f>built palaces, </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>Judah has multiplied fortified cities; </t><t>so <f>ⓑ</f>I will send a fire upon his cities, </t><t>and it shall devour her strongholds. </t>
