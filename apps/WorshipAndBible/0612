Ezekiel 36-1 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, prophesy to <f>ⓑ</f>the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.
Ezekiel 36-2 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓒ</f>the enemy said of you, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Aha!’ and, ‘The ancient <f>ⓔ</f>heights have become our possession,’
Ezekiel 36-3 therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Precisely because <f>ⓕ</f>they made you desolate and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and <f>ⓖ</f>you became the talk and evil gossip of the people,
Ezekiel 36-4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to <f>ⓗ</f>the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, <f>ⓘ</f>the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become <f>ⓙ</f>a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around,
Ezekiel 36-5 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Surely I have spoken in <f>ⓚ</f>my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations and <f>ⓛ</f>against all Edom, who <f>ⓜ</f>gave my land to themselves as a possession <f>ⓝ</f>with wholehearted joy and <f>ⓞ</f>utter contempt, that they might make its pasturelands a prey.
Ezekiel 36-6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to <f>ⓟ</f>the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓠ</f>Behold, I have spoken in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered <f>ⓡ</f>the reproach of the nations.
Ezekiel 36-7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓢ</f>I swear that the nations that are all around you <f>ⓣ</f>shall themselves suffer reproach.
Ezekiel 36-8 <pb/>“But you, O mountains of Israel, <f>ⓤ</f>shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for <f>ⓥ</f>they will soon come home.
Ezekiel 36-9 For <f>ⓦ</f>behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and <f>ⓧ</f>you shall be tilled and sown.
Ezekiel 36-10 And <f>ⓨ</f>I will multiply people on you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. <f>ⓩ</f>The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt.
Ezekiel 36-11 And I will multiply on you <f>ⓐ</f>man and beast, and <f>ⓑ</f>they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in <f>ⓒ</f>your former times, and <f>ⓓ</f>will do more good to you than ever before. <f>ⓔ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 36-12 I will let people walk on you, even my people Israel. <f>ⓕ</f>And they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no longer <f>ⓖ</f>bereave them of children.
Ezekiel 36-13 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because they say to you, <f>ⓗ</f>‘You devour people, and you bereave your nation of children,’
Ezekiel 36-14 therefore you shall no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 36-15 And I will not let you hear anymore <f>ⓘ</f>the reproach of the nations, and you shall no longer bear the disgrace of the peoples and no longer cause your nation to stumble, declares the Lord GOD.”
Ezekiel 36-16 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 36-17 <f>ⓙ</f> “Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, <f>ⓚ</f>they defiled it by their ways and their deeds. Their ways before me were <f>ⓛ</f>like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity.
Ezekiel 36-18 So <f>ⓜ</f>I poured out my wrath upon them <f>ⓝ</f>for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols <f>ⓞ</f>with which they had defiled it.
Ezekiel 36-19 <f>ⓟ</f> I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. <f>ⓠ</f>In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them.
Ezekiel 36-20 But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, <f>ⓡ</f>they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, ‘These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.’
Ezekiel 36-21 But I had concern <f>ⓢ</f>for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.
Ezekiel 36-22 <pb/>“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓣ</f>It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, <f>ⓤ</f>which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.
Ezekiel 36-23 <f>ⓥ</f> And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. <f>ⓦ</f>And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.
Ezekiel 36-24 <f>ⓧ</f> I will take you <f>ⓨ</f>from the nations and gather you from all the countries and <f>ⓩ</f>bring you into your own land.
Ezekiel 36-25 <f>ⓐ</f> I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from <f>ⓑ</f>all your uncleannesses, and <f>ⓒ</f>from all your idols <f>ⓓ</f>I will cleanse you.
Ezekiel 36-26 And I will give you <f>ⓔ</f>a new heart, and <f>ⓕ</f>a new spirit I will put within you. <f>ⓖ</f>And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel 36-27 <f>ⓗ</f> And I will put my Spirit within you, <f>ⓘ</f>and cause you to walk in my statutes and <f>ⓙ</f>be careful to obey my rules. <f>[1]</f>
Ezekiel 36-28 <f>ⓚ</f> You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and <f>ⓛ</f>you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Ezekiel 36-29 And <f>ⓜ</f>I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses. And <f>ⓝ</f>I will summon the grain and make it abundant and <f>ⓞ</f>lay no famine upon you.
Ezekiel 36-30 <f>ⓟ</f> I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, <f>ⓠ</f>that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations.
Ezekiel 36-31 Then <f>ⓡ</f>you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations.
Ezekiel 36-32 <f>ⓢ</f> It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
Ezekiel 36-33 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day that <f>ⓣ</f>I cleanse you from all your iniquities, <f>ⓤ</f>I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt.
Ezekiel 36-34 And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by.
Ezekiel 36-35 And they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like <f>ⓥ</f>the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.’
Ezekiel 36-36 Then <f>ⓦ</f>the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the LORD; I have rebuilt the ruined places and <f>ⓧ</f>replanted that which was desolate. <f>ⓨ</f>I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it.
Ezekiel 36-37 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: This also <f>ⓩ</f>I will let the house of Israel ask me to do for them: <f>ⓐ</f>to increase their people like <f>ⓑ</f>a flock.
Ezekiel 36-38 Like the flock for sacrifices, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so <f>ⓓ</f>shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of people. <f>ⓔ</f>Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
