13-1 <pb/>David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.
13-2 And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and from the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brothers <f>ⓐ</f>who remain in all the lands of Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites in the cities that have pasturelands, that they may be gathered to us.
13-3 Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us, <f>ⓑ</f>for we did not seek it <f>[1]</f> in the days of Saul.”
13-4 All the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
13-5 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> So David assembled all Israel <f>ⓓ</f>from the <f>ⓔ</f>Nile <f>[2]</f> of Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God <f>ⓕ</f>from Kiriath-jearim.
13-6 <f>ⓖ</f> And David and all Israel went up to <f>ⓗ</f>Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim that belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the LORD who <f>ⓘ</f>sits enthroned above the cherubim.
13-7 And they carried the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of <f>ⓙ</f>Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio <f>[3]</f> were driving the cart.
13-8 And David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, with song and <f>ⓚ</f>lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets.
13-9 <pb/>And when they came to the threshing floor of <f>ⓛ</f>Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
13-10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him down <f>ⓜ</f>because he put out his hand to the ark, and <f>ⓝ</f>he died there before God.
13-11 And David was angry because the LORD had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzza <f>[4]</f> to this day.
13-12 And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, “How can I bring the ark of God home to me?”
13-13 So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it aside to the house <f>ⓞ</f>of Obed-edom the Gittite.
13-14 And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months. <f>ⓟ</f>And the LORD blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he had.
37-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORD.
37-2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet <f>ⓑ</f>Isaiah the son of Amoz.
37-3 They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a <f>ⓒ</f>day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; <f>ⓓ</f>children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.
37-4 <f>ⓔ</f> It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for <f>ⓕ</f>the remnant that is left.’”
37-5 <pb/>When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
37-6 Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me.
37-7 Behold, <f>ⓖ</f>I will put a spirit in him, so that <f>ⓗ</f>he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and <f>ⓘ</f>I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’”
37-8 <pb/>The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against <f>ⓙ</f>Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left <f>ⓚ</f>Lachish.
37-9 Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of <f>ⓛ</f>Cush, <f>[1]</f> “He has set out to fight against you.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
37-10 “Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: <f>ⓜ</f>‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
37-11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered?
37-12 <f>ⓝ</f> Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed, <f>ⓞ</f>Gozan, <f>ⓟ</f>Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?
37-13 <f>ⓠ</f> Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’”
37-14 <pb/>Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
37-15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
37-16 “O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, <f>ⓡ</f>enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; <f>ⓢ</f>you have made heaven and earth.
37-17 <f>ⓣ</f> Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear <f>ⓤ</f>all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.
37-18 Truly, O LORD, <f>ⓥ</f>the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,
37-19 and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.
37-20 So now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the LORD.”
37-21 <pb/>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
37-22 this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: <pb/><t>“‘She despises you, she scorns you — </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>the virgin daughter of Zion; </t><t>she wags her head behind you — </t><t>the daughter of Jerusalem. </t>
37-23 <pb/><t>“‘Whom have you mocked and reviled? </t><t>Against whom have you raised your voice </t><t>and lifted your eyes to the heights? </t><t>Against <f>ⓧ</f>the Holy One of Israel!</t>
37-24 <t>By your servants you have mocked the Lord, </t><t>and you have said, <f>ⓨ</f>With my many chariots </t><t>I have gone up the heights of the mountains, </t><t>to the far recesses of Lebanon, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>to cut down its tallest cedars, </t><t>its choicest cypresses, </t><t>to come to its remotest height, </t><t>its most fruitful forest.</t>
37-25 <t>I dug wells </t><t>and drank waters, </t><t>to dry up with the sole of my foot </t><t>all <f>ⓐ</f>the streams <f>ⓑ</f>of Egypt. </t>
37-26 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> “‘Have you not heard </t><t>that I determined it long ago? </t><t>I planned from days of old </t><t>what now I bring to pass, </t><t>that you should make fortified cities </t><t>crash into heaps of ruins,</t>
37-27 <t>while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, </t><t>are dismayed and confounded, </t><t>and have become like plants of the field </t><t>and like tender grass, </t><t>like grass on the housetops, </t><t>blighted <f>[2]</f> before it is grown. </t>
37-28 <pb/><t>“‘I know your sitting down </t><t>and your going out and coming in, </t><t>and your raging against me.</t>
37-29 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Because you have raged against me </t><t>and your complacency has come to my ears, </t><t>I will put my hook in your nose </t><t>and my bit in your mouth, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>I will turn you back on the way </t><t>by which you came.’ </t>
37-30 <pb/>“And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that. Then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
37-31 And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah <f>ⓕ</f>shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
37-32 <f>ⓖ</f> For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. <f>ⓗ</f>The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
37-33 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or <f>ⓘ</f>cast up a siege mound against it.
37-34 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, declares the LORD.
37-35 <f>ⓙ</f> For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for <f>ⓚ</f>the sake of my servant David.”
37-36 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
37-37 Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at <f>ⓜ</f>Nineveh.
37-38 And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. And after they escaped into the land of <f>ⓝ</f>Ararat, <f>ⓞ</f>Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, <f>ⓑ</f>as some do, <f>ⓒ</f>letters of recommendation to you, or from you?
3-2 <f>ⓓ</f> You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our <f>[1]</f> hearts, to be known and read by all.
3-3 And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of <f>ⓔ</f>the living God, not on <f>ⓕ</f>tablets of stone but on <f>ⓖ</f>tablets of <f>ⓗ</f>human hearts. <f>[2]</f>
3-4 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
3-5 <f>ⓙ</f> Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but <f>ⓚ</f>our sufficiency is from God,
3-6 who has made us sufficient to be <f>ⓛ</f>ministers of <f>ⓜ</f>a new covenant, not of <f>ⓝ</f>the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but <f>ⓞ</f>the Spirit gives life.
3-7 <pb/>Now if <f>ⓟ</f>the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory <f>ⓠ</f>that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end,
3-8 will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?
3-9 For if there was glory in <f>ⓡ</f>the ministry of condemnation, <f>ⓢ</f>the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory.
3-10 Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it.
3-11 For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.
3-12 <pb/>Since we have such a hope, <f>ⓣ</f>we are very bold,
3-13 not like Moses, <f>ⓤ</f>who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end.
3-14 But <f>ⓥ</f>their minds were <f>ⓦ</f>hardened. For to this day, <f>ⓧ</f>when they read <f>ⓨ</f>the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away.
3-15 Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts.
3-16 But when <f>ⓩ</f>one <f>[3]</f> turns to the Lord, <f>ⓐ</f>the veil is removed.
3-17 Now the Lord <f>[4]</f> is the Spirit, and where <f>ⓑ</f>the Spirit of the Lord is, there is <f>ⓒ</f>freedom.
3-18 And we all, with unveiled face, <f>ⓓ</f>beholding <f>ⓔ</f>the glory of the Lord, <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>are being transformed into the same image <f>ⓖ</f>from one degree of glory to another. <f>[6]</f> For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.
