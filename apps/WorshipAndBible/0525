40-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
40-2 “On the <f>ⓐ</f>first day of the first month you shall <f>ⓑ</f>erect the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
40-3 And you shall put in it the ark of the testimony, and you shall <f>ⓒ</f>screen the ark with the veil.
40-4 And <f>ⓓ</f>you shall bring in the table and arrange it, and <f>ⓔ</f>you shall bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
40-5 <f>ⓕ</f> And you shall put the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the screen for the door of the tabernacle.
40-6 <f>ⓖ</f> You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting,
40-7 <f>ⓗ</f> and place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
40-8 And you shall set up the court all around, and hang up the screen for the gate of the court.
40-9 <pb/>“Then you shall take the <f>ⓘ</f>anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and consecrate it and all its furniture, so that it may become holy.
40-10 You shall also anoint <f>ⓙ</f>the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar, <f>ⓚ</f>so that the altar may become most holy.
40-11 You shall also anoint the basin and its stand, and consecrate it.
40-12 <f>ⓛ</f> Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall wash them with water
40-13 and put on Aaron the holy garments. And you shall anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve me as priest.
40-14 You shall bring his sons also and put coats on them,
40-15 <f>ⓜ</f> and anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may serve me as priests. And their anointing shall admit them to a <f>ⓝ</f>perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.”
40-16 <pb/>This Moses did; according to all that the LORD commanded him, so he did.
40-17 In the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, <f>ⓞ</f>the tabernacle was erected.
40-18 Moses erected the tabernacle. He laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars.
40-19 And he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent over it, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
40-20 He <f>ⓟ</f>took the testimony and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the ark and set the mercy seat above on the ark.
40-21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle and <f>ⓠ</f>set up the veil of the screen, and screened <f>ⓡ</f>the ark of the testimony, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
40-22 <f>ⓢ</f> He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil,
40-23 and arranged the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
40-24 <f>ⓣ</f> He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle,
40-25 <f>ⓤ</f> and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
40-26 <f>ⓥ</f> He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil,
40-27 and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
40-28 <f>ⓦ</f> He put in place the screen for the door of the tabernacle.
40-29 <f>ⓧ</f> And he set the altar of burnt offering at the entrance of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the <f>ⓨ</f>grain offering, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
40-30 <f>ⓩ</f> He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing,
40-31 with which Moses and <f>ⓐ</f>Aaron and his sons <f>ⓑ</f>washed their hands and their feet.
40-32 When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, as the LORD commanded Moses.
40-33 <f>ⓒ</f> And he erected the court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So <f>ⓓ</f>Moses finished the work.
40-34 <pb/>Then <f>ⓔ</f>the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and <f>ⓕ</f>the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
40-35 And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
40-36 Throughout all their journeys, <f>ⓖ</f>whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would set out.
40-37 But <f>ⓗ</f>if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out till the day that it was taken up.
40-38 For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.
19-1 <pb/>Then Job answered and said:
19-2 <pb/><t>“How long will you torment me </t><t>and break me in pieces with words?</t>
19-3 <t>These <f>ⓐ</f>ten times you have cast reproach upon me; </t><t>are you not ashamed to wrong me?</t>
19-4 <t>And even if it be true that I have erred, </t><t>my error remains with myself.</t>
19-5 <t>If indeed you <f>ⓑ</f>magnify yourselves against me </t><t>and make my disgrace an argument against me,</t>
19-6 <t>know then that God has <f>ⓒ</f>put me in the wrong </t><t>and closed his net about me.</t>
19-7 <t>Behold, I <f>ⓓ</f>cry out, ‘Violence!’ but I am not answered; </t><t>I call for help, but there is no justice.</t>
19-8 <t>He has <f>ⓔ</f>walled up my way, so that I cannot pass, </t><t>and he has set darkness upon my paths.</t>
19-9 <t>He has <f>ⓕ</f>stripped from me my glory </t><t>and taken the <f>ⓖ</f>crown from my head.</t>
19-10 <t>He breaks me down on every side, and I <f>ⓗ</f>am gone, </t><t>and my hope has he pulled up like a tree.</t>
19-11 <t>He has kindled his wrath against me </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>counts me as his adversary.</t>
19-12 <t>His <f>ⓙ</f>troops come on together; </t><t>they have <f>ⓚ</f>cast up their siege ramp <f>[1]</f> against me </t><t>and encamp around my tent. </t>
19-13 <pb/><t>“He has put my <f>ⓛ</f>brothers far from me, </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>those who knew me are wholly estranged from me.</t>
19-14 <t>My relatives <f>ⓝ</f>have failed me, </t><t>my close <f>ⓞ</f>friends have forgotten me.</t>
19-15 <t>The guests <f>ⓟ</f>in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger; </t><t>I have become a foreigner in their eyes.</t>
19-16 <t>I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer; </t><t>I must plead with him with my mouth for mercy.</t>
19-17 <t>My breath is strange to my <f>ⓠ</f>wife, </t><t>and I am a stench to the children of <f>ⓡ</f>my own mother.</t>
19-18 <t>Even young <f>ⓢ</f>children despise me; </t><t>when I rise they talk against me.</t>
19-19 <t>All my <f>ⓣ</f>intimate friends abhor me, </t><t>and those whom I loved have turned against me.</t>
19-20 <t>My <f>ⓤ</f>bones stick to my skin and to my flesh, </t><t>and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</t>
19-21 <t>Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, O you my friends, </t><t>for the hand of God has <f>ⓥ</f>touched me!</t>
19-22 <t>Why do you, like God, <f>ⓦ</f>pursue me? </t><t>Why are you not satisfied with my flesh? </t>
19-23 <pb/><t>“Oh that my words were written! </t><t>Oh that they were <f>ⓧ</f>inscribed in a book!</t>
19-24 <t>Oh that with an iron <f>ⓨ</f>pen and lead </t><t>they were engraved in the rock forever!</t>
19-25 <t>For I <f>ⓩ</f>know that my <f>ⓐ</f>Redeemer lives, </t><t>and at the last he will stand upon the <f>ⓑ</f>earth. <f>[2]</f></t>
19-26 <t>And after my skin has been thus destroyed, </t><t>yet in <f>[3]</f> my flesh I shall <f>ⓒ</f>see God,</t>
19-27 <t>whom I shall see for myself, </t><t>and my eyes shall behold, and not <f>ⓓ</f>another. </t><t>My heart <f>ⓔ</f>faints within me!</t>
19-28 <t>If you say, ‘How we will <f>ⓕ</f>pursue him!’ </t><t>and, ‘The root of the matter is found in him,’ <f>[4]</f></t>
19-29 <t>be afraid of the sword, </t><t>for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, </t><t>that you may know there is <f>ⓖ</f>a judgment.” </t>
18-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
18-2 “What do you <f>[1]</f> mean <f>ⓐ</f>by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, <f>ⓑ</f>‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge’?
18-3 <f>ⓒ</f> As I live, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓓ</f>this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel.
18-4 Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: <f>ⓔ</f>the soul who sins shall die.
18-5 <pb/>“If a man is righteous and does <f>ⓕ</f>what is just and right —
18-6 if he <f>ⓖ</f>does not eat upon the mountains or <f>ⓗ</f>lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, <f>ⓘ</f>does not defile his neighbor's wife <f>ⓙ</f>or approach <f>ⓚ</f>a woman in her time of menstrual impurity,
18-7 <f>ⓛ</f> does not oppress anyone, but <f>ⓜ</f>restores to the debtor his pledge, <f>ⓝ</f>commits no robbery, <f>ⓞ</f>gives his bread to the hungry <f>ⓟ</f>and covers the naked with a garment,
18-8 <f>ⓠ</f> does not lend at interest <f>ⓡ</f>or take any profit, <f>[2]</f> withholds his hand from injustice, <f>ⓢ</f>executes true justice between man and man,
18-9 <f>ⓣ</f> walks in my statutes, and keeps my rules by acting faithfully — he is righteous; <f>ⓤ</f>he shall surely live, declares the Lord GOD.
18-10 <pb/>“If he fathers a son who is violent, <f>ⓥ</f>a shedder of blood, who does any of these things
18-11 (though he himself did none of these things), <f>ⓦ</f>who even eats upon the mountains, <f>ⓧ</f>defiles his neighbor's wife,
18-12 oppresses the poor and needy, <f>ⓨ</f>commits robbery, <f>ⓩ</f>does not restore the pledge, <f>ⓐ</f>lifts up his eyes to the idols, <f>ⓑ</f>commits abomination,
18-13 <f>ⓒ</f> lends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; <f>ⓓ</f>his blood shall be upon himself.
18-14 <pb/>“Now suppose this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done; he sees, and does not do likewise:
18-15 he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,
18-16 does not oppress anyone, <f>ⓔ</f>exacts no pledge, <f>ⓕ</f>commits no robbery, <f>ⓖ</f>but gives his bread to the hungry <f>ⓗ</f>and covers the naked with a garment,
18-17 withholds his hand from iniquity, <f>[3]</f> takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, <f>ⓘ</f>and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; <f>ⓙ</f>he shall surely live.
18-18 As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, <f>ⓚ</f>behold, he shall die for his iniquity.
18-19 <pb/>“Yet you say, <f>ⓛ</f>‘Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done <f>ⓜ</f>what is just and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, <f>ⓝ</f>he shall surely live.
18-20 <f>ⓞ</f> The soul who sins shall die. <f>ⓟ</f>The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. <f>ⓠ</f>The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, <f>ⓡ</f>and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.
18-21 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does <f>ⓣ</f>what is just and right, <f>ⓤ</f>he shall surely live; he shall not die.
18-22 <f>ⓥ</f> None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done he shall live.
18-23 <f>ⓦ</f> Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?
18-24 <f>ⓧ</f> But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice and does the same abominations that the wicked person does, shall he live? <f>ⓨ</f>None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered; for <f>ⓩ</f>the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, for them he shall die.
18-25 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
18-26 <f>ⓑ</f> When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it; for the injustice that he has done he shall die.
18-27 Again, <f>ⓒ</f>when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he shall save his life.
18-28 Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
18-29 Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
18-30 <pb/>“Therefore <f>ⓓ</f>I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. <f>ⓔ</f>Repent and turn from all your transgressions, <f>ⓕ</f>lest iniquity be your ruin. <f>[4]</f>
18-31 <f>ⓖ</f> Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and <f>ⓗ</f>make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! <f>ⓘ</f>Why will you die, O house of Israel?
18-32 <f>ⓙ</f> For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord GOD; <f>ⓚ</f>so turn, and live.”
19-1 <pb/>After this I heard <f>ⓐ</f>what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, <pb/><t>“Hallelujah! </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,</t>
19-2 <t>for <f>ⓒ</f>his judgments are true and just; </t><t>for he has judged <f>ⓓ</f>the great prostitute </t><t>who corrupted the earth with her immorality, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>has avenged on her the blood of his servants.” </t>
19-3 <pb/>Once more they cried out, <pb/><t>“Hallelujah! </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.” </t>
19-4 <pb/>And <f>ⓖ</f>the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!”
19-5 And from the throne came a voice saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f>“Praise our God, </t><t>all you his servants, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>you who fear him, </t><t>small and great.” </t>
19-6 <pb/>Then I heard what seemed to be <f>ⓙ</f>the voice of a great multitude, like <f>ⓚ</f>the roar of many waters and <f>ⓛ</f>like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out, <pb/><t>“Hallelujah! </t><t>For the Lord our God </t><t>the Almighty <f>ⓜ</f>reigns.</t>
19-7 <t>Let us rejoice and exult </t><t>and give him the glory, </t><t>for <f>ⓝ</f>the marriage of the Lamb has come, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>his Bride has made herself ready;</t>
19-8 <t><f>ⓟ</f> it was granted her to clothe herself </t><t>with fine linen, bright and pure” — </t> <pb/>for the fine linen is <f>ⓠ</f>the righteous deeds of the saints.
19-9 <pb/>And the angel said <f>[1]</f> to me, “Write this: <f>ⓡ</f>Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, <f>ⓢ</f>“These are the true words of God.”
19-10 Then <f>ⓣ</f>I fell down at his feet to worship him, <f>ⓤ</f>but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to <f>ⓥ</f>the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.” For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
19-11 <pb/>Then I saw <f>ⓦ</f>heaven opened, and behold, <f>ⓧ</f>a white horse! The one sitting on it is called <f>ⓨ</f>Faithful and True, and <f>ⓩ</f>in righteousness he judges and makes war.
19-12 <f>ⓐ</f> His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are <f>ⓑ</f>many diadems, and he has <f>ⓒ</f>a name written that no one knows but himself.
19-13 He is clothed in <f>ⓓ</f>a robe dipped in <f>[2]</f> blood, and the name by which he is called is <f>ⓔ</f>The Word of God.
19-14 And the armies of heaven, <f>ⓕ</f>arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, <f>ⓖ</f>were following him on white horses.
19-15 <f>ⓗ</f> From his mouth comes a sharp sword <f>ⓘ</f>with which to strike down the nations, and <f>ⓙ</f>he will rule <f>[3]</f> them with a rod of iron. <f>ⓚ</f>He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.
19-16 On his robe and on his thigh <f>ⓛ</f>he has a name written, <f>ⓜ</f>King of kings and Lord of lords.
19-17 <pb/>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to <f>ⓝ</f>all the birds that fly directly overhead, <f>ⓞ</f>“Come, gather for <f>ⓟ</f>the great supper of God,
19-18 <f>ⓠ</f> to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, <f>[4]</f> both small and great.”
19-19 And I saw <f>ⓡ</f>the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies <f>ⓢ</f>gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army.
19-20 And the beast was captured, and with it <f>ⓣ</f>the false prophet <f>ⓤ</f>who in its presence <f>[5]</f> had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who <f>ⓥ</f>worshiped its image. These two were <f>ⓦ</f>thrown alive into the lake of <f>ⓧ</f>fire that burns with sulfur.
19-21 And the rest were slain by the sword <f>ⓨ</f>that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and <f>ⓩ</f>all the birds were gorged with their flesh.
