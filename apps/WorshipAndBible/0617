23-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
23-2 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, <f>ⓐ</f>These are the appointed feasts of the LORD that you shall <f>ⓑ</f>proclaim as <f>ⓒ</f>holy convocations; they are my appointed feasts.
23-3 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> “Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work. It is a Sabbath to the LORD in all your dwelling places.
23-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> “These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, the <f>ⓕ</f>holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at the time appointed for them.
23-5 <f>ⓖ</f> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight, <f>[1]</f> is the LORD's Passover.
23-6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
23-7 <f>ⓗ</f> On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.
23-8 But you shall present a food offering to the LORD for seven days. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.”
23-9 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
23-10 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, <f>ⓘ</f>When you come into the land that I give you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of <f>ⓙ</f>the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest,
23-11 and he shall <f>ⓚ</f>wave the sheaf before the LORD, so that you may be accepted. On the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
23-12 And on the day when you <f>ⓛ</f>wave the sheaf, you shall offer a <f>ⓜ</f>male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD.
23-13 <f>ⓝ</f> And the grain offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah <f>[2]</f> of fine flour mixed with oil, a food offering to the LORD with a pleasing aroma, <f>ⓞ</f>and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin. <f>[3]</f>
23-14 And you shall eat neither bread nor grain <f>ⓟ</f>parched or <f>ⓠ</f>fresh until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
23-15 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> “You shall count seven full weeks from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the <f>ⓢ</f>wave offering.
23-16 You shall count <f>ⓣ</f>fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath. Then you shall present a grain offering of <f>ⓤ</f>new grain to the LORD.
23-17 You shall bring from your dwelling places two loaves of bread to be waved, made of two tenths of an ephah. They shall be of fine flour, and they shall be baked with leaven, as <f>ⓥ</f>firstfruits to the LORD.
23-18 And you shall present with the bread seven lambs a year old without blemish, and one bull from the herd and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, a food offering with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
23-19 And you shall offer one <f>ⓦ</f>male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old as a sacrifice of <f>ⓧ</f>peace offerings.
23-20 And the priest shall <f>ⓨ</f>wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs. <f>ⓩ</f>They shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
23-21 And you shall make a proclamation on the same day. You shall hold a holy convocation. You shall not do any ordinary work. It is a statute forever in all your dwelling places throughout your generations.
23-22 <pb/>“And <f>ⓐ</f>when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, nor shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the LORD your God.”
23-23 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
23-24 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, In <f>ⓑ</f>the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of solemn rest, <f>ⓒ</f>a memorial proclaimed with blast of trumpets, a holy convocation.
23-25 You shall not do any ordinary work, and you shall present a food offering to the LORD.”
23-26 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
23-27 “Now <f>ⓓ</f>on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be for you a time of holy convocation, and you shall afflict yourselves <f>[4]</f> and present a food offering to the LORD.
23-28 And you shall not do any work on that very day, for it is a Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.
23-29 For whoever is not afflicted <f>[5]</f> on that very day <f>ⓔ</f>shall be cut off from his people.
23-30 And whoever does any work on that very day, that person I will destroy from among his people.
23-31 You shall not do any work. It is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.
23-32 It shall be to you a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict yourselves. On the ninth day of the month beginning at evening, from evening to evening shall you keep your Sabbath.”
23-33 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
23-34 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <f>ⓕ</f>On the fifteenth day of this seventh month and for seven days is the Feast of Booths <f>[6]</f> to the LORD.
23-35 On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall not do any ordinary work.
23-36 For seven days you shall present food offerings to the LORD. <f>ⓖ</f>On the eighth day you shall hold a holy convocation and present a food offering to the LORD. It is a <f>ⓗ</f>solemn assembly; you shall not do any ordinary work.
23-37 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> “These are the appointed feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim as times of holy convocation, for presenting to the LORD food offerings, burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day,
23-38 <f>ⓙ</f> besides the LORD's Sabbaths and besides your gifts and besides all your vow offerings and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.
23-39 <pb/>“On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have <f>ⓚ</f>gathered in the produce of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD seven days. On the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
23-40 And <f>ⓛ</f>you shall take on the first day the fruit of splendid trees, branches of palm trees and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and <f>ⓜ</f>you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
23-41 <f>ⓝ</f> You shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
23-42 <f>ⓞ</f> You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All native Israelites shall dwell in booths,
23-43 that <f>ⓟ</f>your generations may know that I made the people of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.”
23-44 <pb/>Thus Moses <f>ⓠ</f>declared to the people of Israel the appointed feasts of the LORD.
42-1 <pb/>Then Job answered the LORD and said:
42-2 <pb/><t>“I know that you can <f>ⓐ</f>do all things, </t><t>and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.</t>
42-3 <t><f>ⓑ</f> ‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’ </t><t>Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, </t><t>things <f>ⓒ</f>too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</t>
42-4 <t>‘Hear, and I will speak; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>I will question you, and you make it known to me.’</t>
42-5 <t>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, </t><t>but now my eye sees you;</t>
42-6 <t>therefore I despise myself, </t><t>and repent <f>[1]</f> in <f>ⓔ</f>dust and ashes.” </t>
42-7 <pb/>After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz <f>ⓕ</f>the Temanite: “My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
42-8 Now therefore take <f>ⓖ</f>seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and <f>ⓗ</f>offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall <f>ⓘ</f>pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.”
42-9 <f>ⓙ</f> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.
42-10 <pb/>And the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job <f>ⓛ</f>twice as much as he had before.
42-11 Then came to him all his <f>ⓜ</f>brothers and sisters and all who had <f>ⓝ</f>known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they <f>ⓞ</f>showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil <f>[2]</f> that the LORD had brought upon him. And each of them gave him <f>ⓟ</f>a piece of money <f>[3]</f> and <f>ⓠ</f>a ring of gold.
42-12 <pb/>And the LORD blessed <f>ⓡ</f>the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had <f>ⓢ</f>14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
42-13 He had also <f>ⓣ</f>seven sons and three daughters.
42-14 And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch.
42-15 And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance <f>ⓤ</f>among their brothers.
42-16 And after this Job lived 140 years, and <f>ⓥ</f>saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.
42-17 And Job died, an old man, and <f>ⓦ</f>full of days.
41-1 <pb/>Then he brought me to <f>ⓐ</f>the nave and measured the <f>ⓑ</f>jambs. On each side six cubits <f>[1]</f> was the breadth of the jambs. <f>[2]</f>
41-2 And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side. And he measured the length of the nave, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>forty cubits, and its breadth, <f>ⓓ</f>twenty cubits.
41-3 Then he went <f>ⓔ</f>into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls on either side <f>[4]</f> of the entrance, seven cubits.
41-4 And he measured <f>ⓕ</f>the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, across <f>ⓖ</f>the nave. And he said to me, “This is <f>ⓗ</f>the Most Holy Place.”
41-5 <pb/>Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick, and the breadth of <f>ⓘ</f>the side chambers, four cubits, <f>ⓙ</f>all around the temple.
41-6 And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, <f>ⓚ</f>thirty in each story. There were offsets <f>[5]</f> all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, <f>ⓛ</f>so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple.
41-7 And it became broader as it wound upward to the side chambers, because the temple was enclosed upward all around the temple. Thus the temple had a broad area upward, and <f>ⓜ</f>so one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story.
41-8 I saw also that the temple had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of <f>ⓝ</f>six long cubits.
41-9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. <f>ⓞ</f>The free space between the side chambers of the temple and the
41-10 <f>ⓟ</f> other chambers was a breadth of <f>ⓠ</f>twenty cubits all around the temple on every side.
41-11 And the doors of the <f>ⓡ</f>side chambers opened on <f>ⓢ</f>the free space, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the free space was five cubits all around.
41-12 <pb/>The building that was facing <f>ⓣ</f>the separate yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
41-13 <pb/>Then he measured the temple, <f>ⓤ</f>a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long;
41-14 also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits.
41-15 <pb/>Then he measured the length of <f>ⓥ</f>the building facing the yard that was at the back and <f>ⓦ</f>its galleries <f>[6]</f> on either side, a hundred cubits. <pb/>The inside of the nave and the vestibules of the court,
41-16 <f>ⓧ</f> the thresholds and <f>ⓨ</f>the narrow windows and the galleries all around the three of them, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered),
41-17 to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls all around, inside and outside, was a measured pattern. <f>[7]</f>
41-18 It was carved of <f>ⓩ</f>cherubim and <f>ⓐ</f>palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces:
41-19 <f>ⓑ</f> a human face toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple all around.
41-20 From the floor to above the door, cherubim and palm trees were carved; similarly the wall of the nave.
41-21 <pb/>The doorposts of <f>ⓒ</f>the nave were squared, and in front of <f>ⓓ</f>the Holy Place was something resembling
41-22 <f>ⓔ</f> an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad. <f>[8]</f> Its corners, its base, <f>[9]</f> and its walls were of wood. He said to me, “This is <f>ⓕ</f>the table that is before the LORD.”
41-23 The nave and the Holy Place had each <f>ⓖ</f>a double door.
41-24 The double doors had two leaves apiece, <f>ⓗ</f>two swinging leaves for each door.
41-25 And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, <f>ⓘ</f>such as were carved on the walls. And there was <f>ⓙ</f>a canopy <f>[10]</f> of wood in front of <f>ⓚ</f>the vestibule outside.
41-26 And there were <f>ⓛ</f>narrow windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule, <f>ⓜ</f>the side chambers of the temple, and the <f>ⓝ</f>canopies.
