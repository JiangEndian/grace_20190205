2 Kings 12-1 <pb/>In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash <f>[1]</f> began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2 Kings 12-2 And Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all his days, because Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings 12-3 Nevertheless, <f>ⓐ</f>the high places were not taken away; the people continued to sacrifice and make offerings on the high places.
2 Kings 12-4 <pb/>Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things <f>ⓑ</f>that is brought into the house of the LORD, the money for which each man is assessed — the money from the assessment of persons — and <f>ⓒ</f>the money that a man's heart prompts him to bring into the house of the LORD,
2 Kings 12-5 let the priests take, each from his donor, and let them repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered.”
2 Kings 12-6 But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests had made no repairs on the house.
2 Kings 12-7 Therefore King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them, “Why are you not repairing the house? Now therefore take no more money from your donors, but hand it over for the repair of the house.”
2 Kings 12-8 So the priests agreed that they should take no more money from the people, and that they should not repair the house.
2 Kings 12-9 <pb/>Then Jehoiada the priest took <f>ⓓ</f>a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the LORD. And the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
2 Kings 12-10 And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest came up and they bagged and counted <f>ⓔ</f>the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
2 Kings 12-11 Then they would give the money that was weighed out into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD. And they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked on the house of the LORD,
2 Kings 12-12 and <f>ⓕ</f>to the masons and the stonecutters, as well as to buy timber and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of the LORD, and for any outlay for the repairs of the house.
2 Kings 12-13 <f>ⓖ</f> But there were not made for the house of the LORD <f>ⓗ</f>basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels of gold, or of silver, from the money that was brought into the house of the LORD,
2 Kings 12-14 for that was given to the workmen who were repairing the house of the LORD with it.
2 Kings 12-15 And <f>ⓘ</f>they did not ask for an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen, for they dealt honestly.
2 Kings 12-16 The money from <f>ⓙ</f>the guilt offerings and the money from the <f>ⓚ</f>sin offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; <f>ⓛ</f>it belonged to the priests.
2 Kings 12-17 <pb/>At that time <f>ⓜ</f>Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath and took it. But when Hazael set his face <f>ⓝ</f>to go up against Jerusalem,
2 Kings 12-18 Jehoash king of Judah <f>ⓞ</f>took all the sacred gifts that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, had dedicated, <f>ⓟ</f>and his own sacred gifts, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent these to Hazael king of Syria. Then Hazael went away from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12-19 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 12-20 <f>ⓠ</f> His servants arose and made a conspiracy <f>ⓡ</f>and struck down Joash in the house of <f>ⓢ</f>Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
2 Kings 12-21 It was <f>ⓣ</f>Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of <f>ⓤ</f>Shomer, his servants, who struck him down, so that he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, <f>ⓥ</f>and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.

Isaiah 11-2 <t>And <f>ⓑ</f>the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, </t><t>the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, </t><t>the Spirit of counsel and might, </t><t>the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.</t>
Isaiah 11-3 <t>And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD. </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>He shall not judge by <f>ⓓ</f>what his eyes see, </t><t>or decide disputes by <f>ⓔ</f>what his ears hear,</t>
Isaiah 11-4 <t>but <f>ⓕ</f>with righteousness he shall judge the poor, </t><t>and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; </t><t>and he shall <f>ⓖ</f>strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>with the breath of his lips <f>ⓘ</f>he shall kill the wicked.</t>
Isaiah 11-5 <t>Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>faithfulness the belt of his loins. </t>

Isaiah 11-10 <pb/>In that day <f>ⓞ</f>the root of <f>ⓟ</f>Jesse, who shall stand as <f>ⓠ</f>a signal for the peoples — of him shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious.
Isaiah 11-11 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> In that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that remains of his people, <f>ⓢ</f>from Assyria, <f>ⓣ</f>from Egypt, from <f>ⓤ</f>Pathros, from <f>ⓥ</f>Cush, <f>[1]</f> from <f>ⓦ</f>Elam, from <f>ⓧ</f>Shinar, from <f>ⓨ</f>Hamath, and from <f>ⓩ</f>the coastlands of the sea.
Isaiah 11-12 <pb/><t>He will raise <f>ⓐ</f>a signal for the nations </t><t>and will assemble <f>ⓑ</f>the banished of Israel, </t><t>and gather the dispersed of Judah </t><t>from the four corners of the earth.</t>
Isaiah 11-13 <t><f>ⓒ</f> The jealousy of Ephraim shall depart, </t><t>and those who harass Judah shall be cut off; </t><t>Ephraim shall not be jealous of Judah, </t><t>and Judah shall not harass Ephraim.</t>

Isaiah 11-16 <t>And there will be <f>ⓛ</f>a highway from Assyria </t><t>for the remnant that remains of his people, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>as there was for Israel </t><t>when they came up from the land of Egypt. </t>
Romans 9-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> I am speaking the truth in Christ — I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit —
Romans 9-2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
Romans 9-3 For <f>ⓑ</f>I could wish that I myself were <f>ⓒ</f>accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, <f>[1]</f> my kinsmen <f>ⓓ</f>according to the flesh.
Romans 9-4 They are <f>ⓔ</f>Israelites, and to them belong <f>ⓕ</f>the adoption, <f>ⓖ</f>the glory, <f>ⓗ</f>the covenants, <f>ⓘ</f>the giving of the law, <f>ⓙ</f>the worship, and <f>ⓚ</f>the promises.
Romans 9-5 To them belong <f>ⓛ</f>the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, <f>ⓜ</f>who is God over all, <f>ⓝ</f>blessed forever. Amen.
Romans 9-6 <pb/>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,
Romans 9-7 and not all are children of Abraham <f>ⓞ</f>because they are his offspring, but <f>ⓟ</f>“Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.”
Romans 9-8 This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but <f>ⓠ</f>the children of the promise are counted as offspring.
Romans 9-9 For this is what the promise said: <f>ⓡ</f>“About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.”
Romans 9-10 And not only so, but <f>ⓢ</f>also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,
Romans 9-11 though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad — in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of <f>ⓣ</f>him who calls —
Romans 9-12 she was told, <f>ⓤ</f>“The older will serve the younger.”
Romans 9-13 As it is written, <f>ⓥ</f>“Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
Romans 9-14 <pb/>What shall we say then? <f>ⓦ</f>Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!
Romans 9-15 For he says to Moses, <f>ⓧ</f>“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
Romans 9-16 So then it depends not on human will or exertion, <f>[2]</f> but on God, who has mercy.
Romans 9-17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, <f>ⓨ</f>“For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
Romans 9-18 So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
Romans 9-19 <pb/>You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For <f>ⓩ</f>who can resist his will?”
Romans 9-20 But who are you, O man, <f>ⓐ</f>to answer back to God? <f>ⓑ</f>Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?”
Romans 9-21 <f>ⓒ</f> Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump <f>ⓓ</f>one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?
Romans 9-22 What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience <f>ⓔ</f>vessels of wrath <f>ⓕ</f>prepared for destruction,
Romans 9-23 in order to make known <f>ⓖ</f>the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he <f>ⓗ</f>has prepared beforehand for glory —
Romans 9-24 even us whom he <f>ⓘ</f>has called, <f>ⓙ</f>not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?
Romans 9-25 As indeed he says in Hosea, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’ </t><t>and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”</t>
Romans 9-26 <t><f>ⓛ</f> “And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ </t><t>there they will be called <f>ⓜ</f>‘sons of the living God.’” </t>
Romans 9-27 <pb/>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: <f>ⓝ</f>“Though the number of the sons of Israel <f>[3]</f> be as the sand of the sea, <f>ⓞ</f>only a remnant of them will be saved,
Romans 9-28 for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.”
Romans 9-29 And as Isaiah predicted, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> <f>ⓠ</f>“If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>we would have been like Sodom </t><t>and become like Gomorrah.” </t>
Romans 9-30 <pb/>What shall we say, then? <f>ⓢ</f>That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, <f>ⓣ</f>a righteousness that is by faith;
Romans 9-31 but that Israel <f>ⓤ</f>who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>did not succeed in reaching that law.
Romans 9-32 Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the <f>ⓦ</f>stumbling stone,
Romans 9-33 as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f>“Behold, I am laying in Zion <f>ⓨ</f>a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>and whoever believes in him will not be <f>ⓐ</f>put to shame.” </t>
