7-1 <pb/>And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD and brought it to the house of <f>ⓐ</f>Abinadab on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to have charge of the ark of the LORD.
7-2 From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
7-3 <pb/>And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, <f>ⓑ</f>“If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then <f>ⓒ</f>put away the foreign gods and the <f>ⓓ</f>Ashtaroth from among you and <f>ⓔ</f>direct your heart to the LORD <f>ⓕ</f>and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”
7-4 So the people of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and they served the LORD only.
7-5 <pb/>Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel at <f>ⓖ</f>Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.”
7-6 So they gathered at <f>ⓗ</f>Mizpah <f>ⓘ</f>and drew water and poured it out before the LORD <f>ⓙ</f>and fasted on that day and said there, <f>ⓚ</f>“We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.
7-7 Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
7-8 And the people of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”
7-9 So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. And <f>ⓛ</f>Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.
7-10 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel. <f>ⓜ</f>But the LORD thundered with a mighty sound that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel.
7-11 And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them, as far as below Beth-car.
7-12 <pb/>Then Samuel <f>ⓝ</f>took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen <f>[1]</f> and called its name Ebenezer; <f>[2]</f> for he said, “Till now the LORD has helped us.”
7-13 <f>ⓞ</f> So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
7-14 The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.
7-15 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
7-16 And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. And he judged Israel in all these places.
7-17 Then he would return to <f>ⓠ</f>Ramah, for his home was there, and there also he judged Israel. <f>ⓡ</f>And he built there an altar to the LORD.
130-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Out of <f>ⓑ</f>the depths I cry to you, O LORD!</t>
130-2 <t>O Lord, hear my voice! </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>Let your ears be attentive </t><t>to <f>ⓓ</f>the voice of my pleas for mercy! </t>
130-3 <pb/><t>If you, O LORD, should <f>ⓔ</f>mark iniquities, </t><t>O Lord, who could <f>ⓕ</f>stand?</t>
130-4 <t>But with you there is <f>ⓖ</f>forgiveness, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>that you may be feared. </t>
130-5 <pb/><t>I <f>ⓘ</f>wait for the LORD, <f>ⓙ</f>my soul waits, </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>in his word I hope;</t>
130-6 <t>my soul <f>ⓛ</f>waits for the Lord </t><t>more than <f>ⓜ</f>watchmen for <f>ⓝ</f>the morning, </t><t>more than watchmen for the morning. </t>
130-7 <pb/><t>O Israel, <f>ⓞ</f>hope in the LORD! </t><t>For <f>ⓟ</f>with the LORD there is steadfast love, </t><t>and with him is plentiful redemption.</t>
130-8 <t>And he will <f>ⓠ</f>redeem Israel </t><t>from all his iniquities. </t>
16-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f>When the Sabbath was past, <f>ⓒ</f>Mary Magdalene, <f>ⓓ</f>Mary the mother of James, and <f>ⓔ</f>Salome <f>ⓕ</f>bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
16-2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
16-3 And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away <f>ⓖ</f>the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
16-4 And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back — <f>ⓗ</f>it was very large.
16-5 And <f>ⓘ</f>entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, <f>ⓙ</f>dressed in <f>ⓚ</f>a white robe, and <f>ⓛ</f>they were alarmed.
16-6 And he said to them, <f>ⓜ</f>“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.
16-7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that <f>ⓝ</f>he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, <f>ⓞ</f>just as he told you.”
16-8 And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
16-9 <pb/><n>[8]</n> [Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include 16:9–20.] <f>[1]</f> <pb/><e>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</e> </pb> <pb/>[[Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, <f>ⓟ</f>he appeared first to <f>ⓠ</f>Mary Magdalene, <f>ⓡ</f>from whom he had cast out seven demons.
16-10 <f>ⓢ</f> She went and told those who had been with him, <f>ⓣ</f>as they <f>ⓤ</f>mourned and wept.
16-11 But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they <f>ⓥ</f>would not believe it.
16-12 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> After these things <f>ⓧ</f>he appeared in <f>ⓨ</f>another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.
16-13 <f>ⓩ</f> And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.
16-14 <pb/>Afterward <f>ⓐ</f>he appeared <f>ⓑ</f>to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked them for their <f>ⓒ</f>unbelief and <f>ⓓ</f>hardness of heart, because <f>ⓔ</f>they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.
16-15 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Go into all the world and <f>ⓖ</f>proclaim the gospel to <f>ⓗ</f>the whole creation.</J>
16-16 <J><f>ⓘ</f> Whoever believes and is <f>ⓙ</f>baptized <f>ⓚ</f>will be saved, but <f>ⓛ</f>whoever <f>ⓜ</f>does not believe will be condemned.</J>
16-17 <J>And <f>ⓝ</f>these signs will accompany those who believe: <f>ⓞ</f>in my name they will cast out demons; <f>ⓟ</f>they will speak in new tongues;</J>
16-18 <J><f>ⓠ</f> they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; <f>ⓡ</f>they will lay their hands <f>ⓢ</f>on the sick, and they will recover.”</J>
16-19 <pb/>So then the Lord Jesus, <f>ⓣ</f>after he had spoken to them, <f>ⓤ</f>was taken up into heaven and <f>ⓥ</f>sat down at the right hand of God.
16-20 And they went out and preached everywhere, while <f>ⓦ</f>the Lord worked with them and confirmed <f>ⓧ</f>the message <f>ⓨ</f>by accompanying signs.]]
