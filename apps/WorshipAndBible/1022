4-1 <pb/>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. <pb/>Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines. They encamped at <f>ⓐ</f>Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at <f>ⓑ</f>Aphek.
4-2 The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle.
4-3 And when the people came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here <f>ⓒ</f>from Shiloh, that it <f>[1]</f> may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.”
4-4 So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓓ</f>who is enthroned on the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
4-5 <pb/>As soon as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel <f>ⓔ</f>gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.
4-6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp,
4-7 the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “A god has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.
4-8 Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.
4-9 <f>ⓕ</f> Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews <f>ⓖ</f>as they have been to you; be men and fight.”
4-10 <pb/>So the Philistines fought, <f>ⓗ</f>and Israel was defeated, <f>ⓘ</f>and they fled, every man to his home. And there was a very great slaughter, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.
4-11 <f>ⓙ</f> And the ark of God was captured, <f>ⓚ</f>and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
4-12 <pb/>A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day, <f>ⓛ</f>with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head.
4-13 When he arrived, <f>ⓜ</f>Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out.
4-14 When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, “What is this uproar?” Then the man hurried and came and told Eli.
4-15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old <f>ⓝ</f>and his eyes were set so that he could not see.
4-16 And the man said to Eli, “I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.” And he said, <f>ⓞ</f>“How did it go, my son?”
4-17 He who brought the news answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great defeat among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
4-18 As soon as he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward <f>ⓟ</f>from his seat by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
4-19 <pb/>Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth, for her pains came upon her.
4-20 And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, <f>ⓠ</f>“Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer or pay attention.
4-21 And she named the child <f>ⓡ</f>Ichabod, saying, <f>ⓢ</f>“The glory has departed <f>[2]</f> from Israel!” because <f>ⓣ</f>the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
4-22 And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, <f>ⓤ</f>for the ark of God has been captured.”
127-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Unless the LORD builds the house, </t><t>those who build it labor in vain. </t><t>Unless the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>watches over the city, </t><t>the watchman stays awake in vain.</t>
127-2 <t>It is in vain that you rise up early </t><t>and go late to rest, </t><t>eating the bread of anxious <f>ⓒ</f>toil; </t><t>for he gives to his <f>ⓓ</f>beloved <f>ⓔ</f>sleep. </t>
127-3 <pb/><t>Behold, <f>ⓕ</f>children are a heritage from the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the fruit of the womb a reward.</t>
127-4 <t>Like arrows in the hand of <f>ⓗ</f>a warrior </t><t>are the children <f>[1]</f> of one's youth.</t>
127-5 <t>Blessed is the man </t><t>who fills his quiver with them! </t><t>He shall not be put to shame </t><t>when he speaks with his enemies <f>ⓘ</f>in the gate. <f>[2]</f> </t>
13-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!”
13-2 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Do you see these great buildings? <f>ⓑ</f>There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”</J>
13-3 <pb/>And as he sat on <f>ⓒ</f>the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, <f>ⓓ</f>Peter and James and John and <f>ⓔ</f>Andrew asked him <f>ⓕ</f>privately,
13-4 “Tell us, <f>ⓖ</f>when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?”
13-5 And Jesus began to say to them, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“See that no one leads you astray.</J>
13-6 <J><f>ⓘ</f> Many will come in my name, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>‘I am he!’ and they will lead many astray.</J>
13-7 <J>And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, <f>ⓚ</f>do not be alarmed. This <f>ⓛ</f>must take place, but the end is not yet.</J>
13-8 <J>For <f>ⓜ</f>nation will rise against nation, and <f>ⓝ</f>kingdom against kingdom. There will be <f>ⓞ</f>earthquakes in various places; there will be <f>ⓟ</f>famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains.</J>
13-9 <pb/><J><f>ⓠ</f> “But <f>ⓡ</f>be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, and you will be beaten <f>ⓢ</f>in synagogues, and you will stand before <f>ⓣ</f>governors and <f>ⓤ</f>kings for my sake, <f>ⓥ</f>to bear witness before them.</J>
13-10 <J>And the gospel must first be proclaimed <f>ⓦ</f>to all nations.</J>
13-11 <J>And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, <f>ⓧ</f>do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say <f>ⓨ</f>whatever is given you in that hour, <f>ⓩ</f>for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</J>
13-12 <J><f>ⓐ</f> And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death.</J>
13-13 <J><f>ⓑ</f> And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. <f>ⓒ</f>But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</J>
13-14 <pb/><J>“But when you see <f>ⓓ</f>the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be (<f>ⓔ</f>let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</J>
13-15 <J><f>ⓕ</f> Let the one who is on <f>ⓖ</f>the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything out,</J>
13-16 <J>and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.</J>
13-17 <J>And <f>ⓗ</f>alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days!</J>
13-18 <J>Pray that it may not happen in winter.</J>
13-19 <J>For in those days there will be <f>ⓘ</f>such <f>ⓙ</f>tribulation as has not been <f>ⓚ</f>from the beginning of the creation that <f>ⓛ</f>God created until now, and never will be.</J>
13-20 <J>And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be saved. But for <f>ⓜ</f>the sake of the elect, whom <f>ⓝ</f>he chose, he shortened the days.</J>
13-21 <J>And <f>ⓞ</f>then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it.</J>
13-22 <J><f>ⓟ</f> For false christs and false prophets will arise and <f>ⓠ</f>perform signs and wonders, <f>ⓡ</f>to lead astray, if possible, <f>ⓢ</f>the elect.</J>
13-23 <J>But <f>ⓣ</f>be on guard; <f>ⓤ</f>I have told you all things beforehand.</J>
13-24 <pb/><J>“But in those days, after <f>ⓥ</f>that tribulation, <f>ⓦ</f>the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,</J>
13-25 <J>and <f>ⓧ</f>the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</J>
13-26 <J>And then they will see <f>ⓨ</f>the Son of Man coming in clouds <f>ⓩ</f>with great power and glory.</J>
13-27 <J>And then <f>ⓐ</f>he will send out the angels and <f>ⓑ</f>gather <f>ⓒ</f>his elect from <f>ⓓ</f>the four winds, from <f>ⓔ</f>the ends of the earth <f>ⓕ</f>to the ends of heaven.</J>
13-28 <pb/><J>“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.</J>
13-29 <J>So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, <f>ⓖ</f>at the very gates.</J>
13-30 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.</J>
13-31 <J><f>ⓘ</f> Heaven and earth will pass away, but <f>ⓙ</f>my words will not pass away.</J>
13-32 <pb/><J>“But concerning that day or that hour, <f>ⓚ</f>no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, <f>ⓛ</f>nor the Son, <f>ⓜ</f>but only the Father.</J>
13-33 <J><f>ⓝ</f> Be on guard, <f>ⓞ</f>keep awake. <f>[1]</f> For you do not know when the time will come.</J>
13-34 <J><f>ⓟ</f> It is like a man <f>ⓠ</f>going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants <f>[2]</f> in charge, <f>ⓡ</f>each with his work, and commands <f>ⓢ</f>the doorkeeper to stay awake.</J>
13-35 <J><f>ⓣ</f> Therefore stay awake — for you do not know when the master of the house will come, <f>ⓤ</f>in the evening, or <f>ⓥ</f>at midnight, or <f>ⓦ</f>when the rooster crows, <f>[3]</f> or <f>ⓧ</f>in the morning — </J>
13-36 <J>lest <f>ⓨ</f>he come suddenly and <f>ⓩ</f>find you asleep.</J>
13-37 <J>And what I say to you I say to all: <f>ⓐ</f>Stay awake.”</J>
