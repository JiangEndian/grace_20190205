18-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days <f>ⓑ</f>the tribe of the people of Dan was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them.
18-2 So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe, <f>ⓒ</f>from Zorah and from Eshtaol, <f>ⓓ</f>to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, “Go and explore the land.” And they came <f>ⓔ</f>to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
18-3 When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. And they turned aside and said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here?”
18-4 And he said to them, “This is how Micah dealt with me: <f>ⓕ</f>he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”
18-5 And they said to him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed.”
18-6 And the priest said to them, <f>ⓗ</f>“Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of the LORD.”
18-7 <pb/>Then the five men departed and came to <f>ⓘ</f>Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, <f>ⓙ</f>quiet and unsuspecting, lacking <f>[1]</f> nothing that is in the earth and possessing wealth, and how <f>ⓚ</f>they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone.
18-8 And when they came to their brothers at <f>ⓛ</f>Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, “What do you report?”
18-9 They said, <f>ⓜ</f>“Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. <f>ⓝ</f>And will you do nothing? <f>ⓞ</f>Do not be slow to go, to enter in and possess the land.
18-10 As soon as you go, you will come to an <f>ⓟ</f>unsuspecting people. The land is spacious, for God has given it into your hands, <f>ⓠ</f>a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”
18-11 <pb/>So 600 men of the tribe of Dan, <f>ⓡ</f>armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol,
18-12 and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called <f>ⓢ</f>Mahaneh-dan <f>[2]</f> to this day; behold, it is west of <f>ⓣ</f>Kiriath-jearim.
18-13 And they passed on from there to <f>ⓤ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
18-14 <pb/>Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers, “Do you know that <f>ⓥ</f>in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a metal image? Now therefore consider what you will do.”
18-15 And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and <f>ⓦ</f>asked him about his welfare.
18-16 Now the 600 men of the Danites, <f>ⓧ</f>armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate.
18-17 And <f>ⓨ</f>the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took <f>ⓩ</f>the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war.
18-18 And when these went into Micah's house and took <f>ⓐ</f>the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
18-19 And they said to him, “Keep quiet; <f>ⓑ</f>put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us <f>ⓒ</f>a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?”
18-20 And the priest's heart was glad. He took the ephod and the household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.
18-21 <pb/>So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the livestock and <f>ⓓ</f>the goods in front of them.
18-22 When they had gone a distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house were called out, and they overtook the people of Dan.
18-23 And they shouted to the people of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you, that you come with such a company?”
18-24 And he said, <f>ⓔ</f>“You take my gods that I made and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, ‘What is the matter with you?’”
18-25 And the people of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.”
18-26 Then the people of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.
18-27 <pb/>But the people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, and they came to Laish, to a people <f>ⓕ</f>quiet and unsuspecting, and <f>ⓖ</f>struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
18-28 And there was no deliverer because it was <f>ⓗ</f>far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to <f>ⓘ</f>Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the city and lived in it.
18-29 And they named the city <f>ⓙ</f>Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but <f>ⓚ</f>the name of the city was Laish at the first.
18-30 And the people of Dan set up the carved image for themselves, and Jonathan the son of Gershom, <f>ⓛ</f>son of Moses, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓜ</f>and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day <f>ⓝ</f>of the captivity of the land.
18-31 So they set up Micah's carved image that he made, <f>ⓞ</f>as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.
116-1 <pb/><t>I <f>ⓐ</f>love the LORD, because he has <f>ⓑ</f>heard </t><t>my voice and my pleas for mercy.</t>
116-2 <t>Because he <f>ⓒ</f>inclined his ear to me, </t><t>therefore I will call on him as long as I live.</t>
116-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> The snares of death encompassed me; </t><t>the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; </t><t>I suffered distress and anguish.</t>
116-4 <t>Then <f>ⓔ</f>I called on the name of the LORD: </t><t>“O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!” </t>
116-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> Gracious is the LORD, and <f>ⓖ</f>righteous; </t><t>our God is <f>ⓗ</f>merciful.</t>
116-6 <t>The LORD preserves <f>ⓘ</f>the simple; </t><t>when <f>ⓙ</f>I was brought low, he saved me.</t>
116-7 <t>Return, O my soul, to your <f>ⓚ</f>rest; </t><t>for the LORD has <f>ⓛ</f>dealt bountifully with you. </t>
116-8 <pb/><t>For <f>ⓜ</f>you have delivered my soul from death, </t><t>my eyes from tears, </t><t>my feet from stumbling;</t>
116-9 <t>I will walk before the LORD </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>in the land of the living. </t>
116-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> I believed, <f>ⓟ</f>even when <f>[1]</f> I spoke: </t><t>“I am greatly afflicted”;</t>
116-11 <t><f>ⓠ</f> I said in my alarm, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>“All mankind are liars.” </t>
116-12 <pb/><t>What shall I <f>ⓢ</f>render to the LORD </t><t>for all his benefits to me?</t>
116-13 <t>I will lift up <f>ⓣ</f>the cup of salvation </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>call on the name of the LORD,</t>
116-14 <t>I will <f>ⓥ</f>pay my vows to the LORD </t><t>in the presence of all his people. </t>
116-15 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> Precious in the sight of the LORD </t><t>is the death of his <f>ⓧ</f>saints.</t>
116-16 <t>O LORD, I am your <f>ⓨ</f>servant; </t><t>I am your servant, <f>ⓩ</f>the son of your maidservant. </t><t>You have <f>ⓐ</f>loosed my bonds.</t>
116-17 <t>I will <f>ⓑ</f>offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>call on the name of the LORD.</t>
116-18 <t>I will <f>ⓓ</f>pay my vows to the LORD </t><t>in the presence of all his people,</t>
116-19 <t>in <f>ⓔ</f>the courts of the house of the LORD, </t><t>in your midst, O Jerusalem. </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>Praise the LORD! </t>
2-1 <pb/>And when he returned to <f>ⓐ</f>Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.
2-2 And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them.
2-3 <f>ⓑ</f> And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.
2-4 And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, <f>ⓒ</f>they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
2-5 And when Jesus <f>ⓓ</f>saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <J>“Son, <f>ⓔ</f>your sins are forgiven.”</J>
2-6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,
2-7 “Why does this man speak like that? <f>ⓕ</f>He is blaspheming! <f>ⓖ</f>Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
2-8 And immediately Jesus, <f>ⓗ</f>perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <J>“Why do you question these things in your hearts?</J>
2-9 <J>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’?</J>
2-10 <J>But that you may know that <f>ⓘ</f>the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</J> — he said to the paralytic —
2-11 <J>“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.”</J>
2-12 And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and <f>ⓙ</f>glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”
2-13 <pb/>He went out again beside the sea, and <f>ⓚ</f>all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them.
2-14 <f>ⓛ</f> And as he passed by, he saw <f>ⓜ</f>Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, <J>“Follow me.”</J> And he rose and followed him.
2-15 <pb/>And as he reclined at table in his house, many <f>ⓝ</f>tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
2-16 And <f>ⓞ</f>the scribes of <f>[1]</f> the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, <f>ⓟ</f>“Why does he eat <f>[2]</f> with tax collectors and sinners?”
2-17 And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, <J>“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. <f>ⓠ</f>I came not to call the righteous, <f>ⓡ</f>but sinners.”</J>
2-18 <pb/>Now <f>ⓢ</f>John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, <f>ⓣ</f>“Why do John's disciples and <f>ⓤ</f>the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
2-19 And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</J>
2-20 <J><f>ⓦ</f> The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and <f>ⓧ</f>then they will fast in that day.</J>
2-21 <J>No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.</J>
2-22 <J>And no one puts new wine into old <f>ⓨ</f>wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins — and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins.” <f>[3]</f></J>
2-23 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples <f>ⓐ</f>began to pluck heads of grain.
2-24 And the Pharisees were saying to him, “Look, <f>ⓑ</f>why are they doing <f>ⓒ</f>what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
2-25 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Have you never read <f>ⓔ</f>what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:</J>
2-26 <J>how he entered the house of God, in the time of <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>Abiathar the high priest, and ate <f>ⓖ</f>the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?”</J>
2-27 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“The Sabbath was made for man, <f>ⓘ</f>not man for the Sabbath.</J>
2-28 <J>So <f>ⓙ</f>the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</J>
