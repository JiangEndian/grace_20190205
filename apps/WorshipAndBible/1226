1 Kings 14-1 <pb/>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
1 Kings 14-2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Arise, and disguise yourself, that it not be known that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to <f>ⓐ</f>Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, <f>ⓑ</f>who said of me that I should be king over this people.
1 Kings 14-3 <f>ⓒ</f> Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what shall happen to the child.”
1 Kings 14-4 <pb/>Jeroboam's wife did so. She arose and went to <f>ⓓ</f>Shiloh and came to the house of <f>ⓔ</f>Ahijah. Now <f>ⓕ</f>Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.
1 Kings 14-5 And the LORD said to <f>ⓖ</f>Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus shall you say to her.” <pb/>When she came, she pretended to be another woman.
1 Kings 14-6 But when <f>ⓗ</f>Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with unbearable news for you.
1 Kings 14-7 Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: <f>ⓘ</f>“Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over my people Israel
1 Kings 14-8 and <f>ⓙ</f>tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, and yet you have not been <f>ⓚ</f>like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes,
1 Kings 14-9 but you have done evil above all who were before you and have gone and <f>ⓛ</f>made for yourself other gods and <f>ⓜ</f>metal images, provoking me to anger, and <f>ⓝ</f>have cast me behind your back,
1 Kings 14-10 therefore behold, I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam and <f>ⓞ</f>will cut off from Jeroboam every male, <f>ⓟ</f>both bond and free in Israel, and <f>ⓠ</f>will burn up the house of Jeroboam, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone.
1 Kings 14-11 <f>ⓡ</f> Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat, for the LORD has spoken it.”’
1 Kings 14-12 Arise therefore, go to your house. <f>ⓢ</f>When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.
1 Kings 14-13 And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him <f>ⓣ</f>there is found something pleasing to the LORD, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
1 Kings 14-14 <f>ⓤ</f> Moreover, the LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam today. And henceforth,
1 Kings 14-15 the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water, and <f>ⓥ</f>root up Israel out of <f>ⓦ</f>this good land that he gave to their fathers and scatter them <f>ⓧ</f>beyond the Euphrates, <f>[1]</f> because they have made their <f>ⓨ</f>Asherim, provoking the LORD to anger.
1 Kings 14-16 And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned and made Israel to sin.”
1 Kings 14-17 <pb/>Then Jeroboam's wife arose and departed and came to <f>ⓩ</f>Tirzah. And <f>ⓐ</f>as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
1 Kings 14-18 And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, <f>ⓑ</f>according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.
1 Kings 14-19 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, <f>ⓒ</f>how he warred and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
1 Kings 14-20 And the time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years. And he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.
1 Kings 14-21 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, <f>ⓔ</f>the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. <f>ⓕ</f>His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
1 Kings 14-22 <f>ⓖ</f> And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and they <f>ⓗ</f>provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.
1 Kings 14-23 For they also built for themselves <f>ⓘ</f>high places <f>ⓙ</f>and pillars and <f>ⓚ</f>Asherim on every high hill and <f>ⓛ</f>under every green tree,
1 Kings 14-24 and there were also <f>ⓜ</f>male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations that the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
1 Kings 14-25 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
1 Kings 14-26 He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house. <f>ⓞ</f>He took away everything. He also took away all the shields of gold <f>ⓟ</f>that Solomon had made,
1 Kings 14-27 and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
1 Kings 14-28 And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.
1 Kings 14-29 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
1 Kings 14-30 <f>ⓡ</f> And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
1 Kings 14-31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. <f>ⓢ</f>His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite. And <f>ⓣ</f>Abijam his son reigned in his place.
Ecclesiastes 11-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Cast your bread upon the waters, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>for you will find it after many days.</t>
Ecclesiastes 11-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Give a portion to <f>ⓓ</f>seven, or even to eight, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>for you know not what disaster may happen on earth.</t>
Ecclesiastes 11-3 <t>If the clouds are full of rain, </t><t>they empty themselves on the earth, </t><t>and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, </t><t>in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.</t>
Ecclesiastes 11-4 <t>He who observes the wind will not sow, </t><t>and he who regards the clouds will not reap. </t>
Ecclesiastes 11-5 <pb/>As you do not know the way <f>ⓕ</f>the spirit comes to <f>ⓖ</f>the bones in the womb <f>[1]</f> of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
Ecclesiastes 11-6 <pb/>In the morning sow your seed, and at evening <f>ⓗ</f>withhold not your hand, for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.
Ecclesiastes 11-7 <pb/>Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to <f>ⓘ</f>see the sun.
Ecclesiastes 11-8 <pb/>So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember <f>ⓙ</f>that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is <f>ⓚ</f>vanity. <f>[2]</f>
Ecclesiastes 11-9 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. <f>ⓜ</f>Walk in the ways of your heart and <f>ⓝ</f>the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things <f>ⓞ</f>God will bring you into judgment.
Ecclesiastes 11-10 <pb/>Remove vexation from your heart, and <f>ⓟ</f>put away pain <f>[3]</f> from your body, for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
Acts 17-1 <pb/>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to <f>ⓐ</f>Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Acts 17-2 And Paul went in, <f>ⓑ</f>as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them <f>ⓒ</f>from the Scriptures,
Acts 17-3 <f>ⓓ</f> explaining and proving that it was necessary for <f>ⓔ</f>the Christ to suffer and <f>ⓕ</f>to rise from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.”
Acts 17-4 And <f>ⓖ</f>some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did <f>ⓗ</f>a great many of the devout <f>ⓘ</f>Greeks and not a few of the leading women.
Acts 17-5 <f>ⓙ</f> But the Jews <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>were jealous, and taking <f>ⓛ</f>some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd.
Acts 17-6 And when they could not find them, <f>ⓜ</f>they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
Acts 17-7 and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against <f>ⓝ</f>the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is <f>ⓞ</f>another king, Jesus.”
Acts 17-8 And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things.
Acts 17-9 And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
Acts 17-10 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> The brothers <f>[2]</f> immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they <f>ⓠ</f>went into the Jewish synagogue.
Acts 17-11 Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, <f>ⓡ</f>examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
Acts 17-12 <f>ⓢ</f> Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek <f>ⓣ</f>women of high standing as well as men.
Acts 17-13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, <f>ⓤ</f>agitating and stirring up the crowds.
Acts 17-14 Then the brothers <f>ⓥ</f>immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and <f>ⓦ</f>Timothy remained there.
Acts 17-15 <f>ⓧ</f> Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as <f>ⓨ</f>Athens, and after receiving a command <f>ⓩ</f>for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
Acts 17-16 <pb/>Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was <f>ⓐ</f>provoked within him as he saw that the city was <f>ⓑ</f>full of idols.
Acts 17-17 So <f>ⓒ</f>he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
Acts 17-18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, <f>ⓓ</f>“What does this babbler wish to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities” — because <f>ⓔ</f>he was preaching <f>ⓕ</f>Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts 17-19 And they took him and brought him to <f>ⓖ</f>the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this <f>ⓗ</f>new teaching is that you are presenting?
Acts 17-20 For you bring some <f>ⓘ</f>strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.”
Acts 17-21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.
Acts 17-22 <pb/>So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.
Acts 17-23 For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: <f>ⓙ</f>‘To the unknown god.’ <f>ⓚ</f>What therefore you worship <f>ⓛ</f>as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
Acts 17-24 <f>ⓜ</f> The God who made the world and everything in it, being <f>ⓝ</f>Lord of heaven and earth, <f>ⓞ</f>does not live in temples made by man, <f>[3]</f>
Acts 17-25 nor is he served by human hands, <f>ⓟ</f>as though he needed anything, since he himself <f>ⓠ</f>gives to all mankind <f>ⓡ</f>life and breath and everything.
Acts 17-26 And <f>ⓢ</f>he made from one man every nation of mankind to live <f>ⓣ</f>on all the face of the earth, <f>ⓤ</f>having determined allotted periods and <f>ⓥ</f>the boundaries of their dwelling place,
Acts 17-27 <f>ⓦ</f> that they should seek God, <f>ⓧ</f>and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. <f>ⓨ</f>Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,
Acts 17-28 for <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f>“‘In him we live and move and have our being’; <f>[4]</f> </t> <pb/>as even some of <f>ⓐ</f>your own poets have said, <pb/><t>“‘For we are indeed his offspring.’ <f>[5]</f> </t>
Acts 17-29 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Being then God's offspring, <f>ⓒ</f>we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.
Acts 17-30 <f>ⓓ</f> The times of ignorance <f>ⓔ</f>God overlooked, but <f>ⓕ</f>now he <f>ⓖ</f>commands all people everywhere to repent,
Acts 17-31 because he has fixed <f>ⓗ</f>a day on which <f>ⓘ</f>he will judge the world <f>ⓙ</f>in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and <f>ⓚ</f>of this he has given assurance to all <f>ⓛ</f>by raising him from the dead.”
Acts 17-32 <pb/>Now when they heard of <f>ⓜ</f>the resurrection of the dead, <f>ⓝ</f>some mocked. But others said, <f>ⓞ</f>“We will hear you again about this.”
Acts 17-33 So Paul went out from their midst.
Acts 17-34 But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius <f>ⓟ</f>the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
