Isaiah 50-1 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t>“Where is <f>ⓐ</f>your mother's certificate of divorce, </t><t>with which <f>ⓑ</f>I sent her away? </t><t>Or <f>ⓒ</f>which of my creditors is it </t><t>to whom I have sold you? </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, </t><t>and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.</t>
Isaiah 50-2 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Why, when I came, was there no man; </t><t>why, when I called, was there no one to answer? </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>Is my hand shortened, that it cannot redeem? </t><t>Or have I no power to deliver? </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>Behold, by my rebuke <f>ⓗ</f>I dry up the sea, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>I make the rivers a desert; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>their fish stink for lack of water </t><t>and die of thirst.</t>
Isaiah 50-3 <t><f>ⓚ</f> I clothe the heavens with blackness </t><t>and make sackcloth their covering.” </t>
Isaiah 50-4 <pb/><t>The Lord GOD has given <f>ⓛ</f>me </t><t>the tongue of those who are taught, </t><t>that <f>ⓜ</f>I may know how to sustain with a word </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>him who is weary. </t><t>Morning by morning he awakens; </t><t>he awakens my ear </t><t>to hear as those who are taught.</t>
Isaiah 50-5 <t><f>ⓞ</f> The Lord GOD has opened my ear, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>and I was not rebellious; </t><t>I turned not backward.</t>
Isaiah 50-6 <t><f>ⓠ</f> I gave my back to those who strike, </t><t>and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard; </t><t>I hid not my face </t><t>from disgrace and spitting. </t>
Isaiah 50-7 <pb/><t>But the Lord GOD helps me; </t><t>therefore I have not been disgraced; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>therefore I have set my face like a flint, </t><t>and I know that I shall not be put to shame.</t>

Galatians 3-1 <pb/>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? <f>ⓐ</f>It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly <f>ⓑ</f>portrayed as crucified.
Galatians 3-2 Let me ask you only this: <f>ⓒ</f>Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by <f>ⓓ</f>hearing with faith?
Galatians 3-3 Are you so foolish? <f>ⓔ</f>Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by <f>[1]</f> the flesh?
Galatians 3-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Did you suffer <f>[2]</f> so many things in vain — if indeed it was in vain?
Galatians 3-5 Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and <f>ⓖ</f>works miracles among you do so <f>ⓗ</f>by works of the law, or by hearing with faith —
Galatians 3-6 just as <f>ⓘ</f>Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”?
Galatians 3-7 <pb/>Know then that it is <f>ⓙ</f>those of faith who are <f>ⓚ</f>the sons of Abraham.
Galatians 3-8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that <f>ⓛ</f>God would justify <f>[3]</f> the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>“In you shall all the nations be blessed.”
Galatians 3-9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
Galatians 3-10 <pb/>For all who rely on works of the law are <f>ⓝ</f>under a curse; for it is written, <f>ⓞ</f>“Cursed be everyone who does not <f>ⓟ</f>abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.”
Galatians 3-11 Now it is evident that <f>ⓠ</f>no one is justified before God by the law, for <f>ⓡ</f>“The righteous shall live by faith.” <f>[4]</f>
Galatians 3-12 But the law is not of faith, rather <f>ⓢ</f>“The one who does them shall live by them.”
Galatians 3-13 Christ <f>ⓣ</f>redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us — for it is written, <f>ⓤ</f>“Cursed is everyone who is hanged <f>ⓥ</f>on a tree” —
Galatians 3-14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might <f>ⓦ</f>come to the Gentiles, so that <f>ⓧ</f>we might receive <f>ⓨ</f>the promised Spirit <f>[5]</f> through faith.
Galatians 3-15 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> To give a human example, brothers: <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified.
Galatians 3-16 Now <f>ⓑ</f>the promises were made <f>ⓒ</f>to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, <f>ⓓ</f>“And to your offspring,” who is Christ.
Galatians 3-17 This is what I mean: the law, which came <f>ⓔ</f>430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as <f>ⓕ</f>to make the promise void.
Galatians 3-18 For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but <f>ⓖ</f>God gave it to Abraham by a promise.
Galatians 3-19 <pb/>Why then the law? <f>ⓗ</f>It was added because of transgressions, <f>ⓘ</f>until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was <f>ⓙ</f>put in place through angels <f>ⓚ</f>by an intermediary.
Galatians 3-20 Now <f>ⓛ</f>an intermediary implies more than one, but <f>ⓜ</f>God is one.
Galatians 3-21 <pb/>Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For <f>ⓝ</f>if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law.
Galatians 3-22 But the Scripture <f>ⓞ</f>imprisoned everything under sin, so that <f>ⓟ</f>the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given <f>ⓠ</f>to those who believe.
Galatians 3-23 <pb/>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, <f>ⓡ</f>imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed.
Galatians 3-24 So then, <f>ⓢ</f>the law was our <f>ⓣ</f>guardian until Christ came, <f>ⓤ</f>in order that we might be justified by faith.
Galatians 3-25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,
Galatians 3-26 for in Christ Jesus <f>ⓥ</f>you are all sons of God, through faith.
Galatians 3-27 For as many of you as <f>ⓦ</f>were baptized <f>ⓧ</f>into Christ have <f>ⓨ</f>put on Christ.
Galatians 3-28 <f>ⓩ</f> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave <f>[7]</f> nor free, <f>ⓐ</f>there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
Galatians 3-29 And <f>ⓑ</f>if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, <f>ⓒ</f>heirs according to promise.
