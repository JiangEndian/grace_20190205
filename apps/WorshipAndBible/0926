Judges 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now these are the nations that the LORD left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan.
Judges 3-2 It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before.
Judges 3-3 These are the nations: <f>ⓑ</f>the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.
Judges 3-4 They were for <f>ⓒ</f>the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
Judges 3-5 So the people of Israel lived <f>ⓓ</f>among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Judges 3-6 <f>ⓔ</f> And their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.
Judges 3-7 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and <f>ⓖ</f>the Asheroth.
Judges 3-8 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>and he sold them into the hand of <f>ⓘ</f>Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
Judges 3-9 But when the people of Israel <f>ⓙ</f>cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a <f>ⓚ</f>deliverer for the people of Israel, who saved them, <f>ⓛ</f>Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
Judges 3-10 <f>ⓜ</f> The Spirit of the LORD was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.
Judges 3-11 <f>ⓝ</f> So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
Judges 3-12 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon <f>ⓟ</f>the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
Judges 3-13 He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the <f>ⓠ</f>Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of <f>ⓡ</f>the city of palms.
Judges 3-14 And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges 3-15 <pb/>Then the people of Israel <f>ⓢ</f>cried out to the LORD, and the LORD raised up for them <f>ⓣ</f>a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, <f>ⓤ</f>a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.
Judges 3-16 And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit <f>[1]</f> in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes.
Judges 3-17 And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
Judges 3-18 And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.
Judges 3-19 But he himself turned back <f>ⓥ</f>at the idols near Gilgal and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” And he commanded, “Silence.” And all his attendants went out from his presence.
Judges 3-20 And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his <f>ⓦ</f>cool roof chamber. <f>ⓧ</f>And Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And he arose from his seat.
Judges 3-21 And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.
Judges 3-22 And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out.
Judges 3-23 Then Ehud went out into the porch <f>[2]</f> and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him <f>ⓨ</f>and locked them.
Judges 3-24 <pb/>When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, <f>ⓩ</f>“Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber.”
Judges 3-25 And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.
Judges 3-26 <pb/>Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond <f>ⓐ</f>the idols and escaped to Seirah.
Judges 3-27 When he arrived, <f>ⓑ</f>he sounded the trumpet in <f>ⓒ</f>the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader.
Judges 3-28 And he said to them, “Follow after me, <f>ⓓ</f>for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him and seized <f>ⓔ</f>the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over.
Judges 3-29 And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped.
Judges 3-30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. <f>ⓕ</f>And the land had rest for eighty years.
Judges 3-31 <pb/>After him was <f>ⓖ</f>Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines <f>ⓗ</f>with an oxgoad, and he also <f>ⓘ</f>saved Israel.
Psalm 101-1 <pb/><t>I will sing of <f>ⓐ</f>steadfast love and justice; </t><t>to you, O LORD, I will make music.</t>
Psalm 101-2 <t>I will <f>ⓑ</f>ponder the way <f>ⓒ</f>that is blameless. </t><t>Oh when will you <f>ⓓ</f>come to me? </t><t>I will <f>ⓔ</f>walk with <f>ⓕ</f>integrity of heart </t><t>within my house;</t>
Psalm 101-3 <t>I will not set before my eyes </t><t>anything <f>ⓖ</f>that is worthless. </t><t>I hate the work of those who <f>ⓗ</f>fall away; </t><t>it shall not cling to me.</t>
Psalm 101-4 <t><f>ⓘ</f> A perverse heart shall be far from me; </t><t>I will <f>ⓙ</f>know nothing of evil. </t>
Psalm 101-5 <pb/><t>Whoever slanders his neighbor <f>ⓚ</f>secretly </t><t>I will <f>ⓛ</f>destroy. </t><t>Whoever has a <f>ⓜ</f>haughty look and an <f>ⓝ</f>arrogant heart </t><t>I will not endure. </t>
Psalm 101-6 <pb/><t>I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, </t><t>that they may dwell with me; </t><t>he who walks in <f>ⓞ</f>the way that is blameless </t><t>shall minister to me. </t>
Psalm 101-7 <pb/><t>No one who <f>ⓟ</f>practices deceit </t><t>shall dwell in my house; </t><t>no one who utters lies </t><t>shall <f>ⓠ</f>continue before my eyes. </t>
Psalm 101-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f> Morning by morning I will destroy </t><t>all the wicked in the land, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>cutting off all <f>ⓣ</f>the evildoers </t><t>from <f>ⓤ</f>the city of the LORD. </t>
Matthew 15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then Pharisees and <f>ⓑ</f>scribes came to Jesus <f>ⓒ</f>from Jerusalem and said,
Matthew 15-2 <f>ⓓ</f> “Why do your disciples break <f>ⓔ</f>the tradition of the elders? <f>ⓕ</f>For they do not wash their hands when they eat.”
Matthew 15-3 He answered them, <J>“And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</J>
Matthew 15-4 <J>For God commanded, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.’</J>
Matthew 15-5 <J>But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or his mother, “What you would have gained from me is given to God,” <f>[1]</f></J>
Matthew 15-6 <J>he need not honor his father.’</J> <J>So for the sake of your tradition you have <f>ⓘ</f>made void the word <f>[2]</f> of God.</J>
Matthew 15-7 <J><f>ⓙ</f> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:</J>
Matthew 15-8 <pb/><t><J><f>ⓚ</f> “‘This people honors me with their lips,</J> </t><t><J>but their heart is far from me;</J></t>
Matthew 15-9 <t><J>in vain do they worship me,</J> </t><t><J>teaching as <f>ⓛ</f>doctrines the commandments of men.’”</J> </t>
Matthew 15-10 <pb/>And he called the people to him and said to them, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“Hear and understand:</J>
Matthew 15-11 <J><f>ⓝ</f> it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.”</J>
Matthew 15-12 Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were <f>ⓞ</f>offended when they heard this saying?”
Matthew 15-13 He answered, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted <f>ⓠ</f>will be rooted up.</J>
Matthew 15-14 <J>Let them alone; <f>ⓡ</f>they are blind guides. <f>[3]</f> And <f>ⓢ</f>if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</J>
Matthew 15-15 But Peter said to him, <f>ⓣ</f>“Explain the parable to us.”
Matthew 15-16 And he said, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“Are you also still without understanding?</J>
Matthew 15-17 <J>Do you not see that <f>ⓥ</f>whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? <f>[4]</f></J>
Matthew 15-18 <J>But <f>ⓦ</f>what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.</J>
Matthew 15-19 <J>For out of the heart come <f>ⓧ</f>evil thoughts, <f>ⓨ</f>murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, <f>ⓩ</f>slander.</J>
Matthew 15-20 <J><f>ⓐ</f> These are what defile a person. But <f>ⓑ</f>to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone.”</J>
Matthew 15-21 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew 15-22 And behold, <f>ⓓ</f>a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, <f>ⓔ</f>“Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.”
Matthew 15-23 But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, <f>ⓕ</f>“Send her away, for she is crying out after us.”
Matthew 15-24 He answered, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</J>
Matthew 15-25 But she came and <f>ⓗ</f>knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.”
Matthew 15-26 And he answered, <J>“It is not right to take the children's bread and <f>ⓘ</f>throw it to the dogs.”</J>
Matthew 15-27 She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat <f>ⓙ</f>the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.”
Matthew 15-28 Then Jesus answered her, <J>“O woman, <f>ⓚ</f>great is your faith! <f>ⓛ</f>Be it done for you as you desire.”</J> <f>ⓜ</f>And her daughter was <f>ⓝ</f>healed instantly. <f>[5]</f>
Matthew 15-29 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Jesus went on from there and walked <f>ⓟ</f>beside the Sea of Galilee. And he <f>ⓠ</f>went up on the mountain and sat down there.
Matthew 15-30 And great crowds came to him, bringing with them <f>ⓡ</f>the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them,
Matthew 15-31 <f>ⓢ</f> so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, <f>ⓣ</f>the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And <f>ⓤ</f>they glorified <f>ⓥ</f>the God of Israel.
Matthew 15-32 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, <J> <f>ⓧ</f>“I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”</J>
Matthew 15-33 And the disciples said to him, “Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?”
Matthew 15-34 And Jesus said to them, <J>“How many loaves do you have?”</J> They said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Seven, and a few small fish.”
Matthew 15-35 And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground,
Matthew 15-36 he took the seven loaves and the fish, and <f>ⓩ</f>having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
Matthew 15-37 And <f>ⓐ</f>they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
Matthew 15-38 Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew 15-39 And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of <f>ⓑ</f>Magadan.
