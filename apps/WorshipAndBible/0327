31-1 <pb/>Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, “Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth.”
31-2 And Jacob saw <f>ⓐ</f>that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.
31-3 Then the LORD said to Jacob, <f>ⓑ</f>“Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.”
31-4 <pb/>So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was
31-5 and said to them, <f>ⓒ</f>“I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father <f>ⓓ</f>has been with me.
31-6 <f>ⓔ</f> You know that I have served your father with all my strength,
31-7 yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages <f>ⓕ</f>ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me.
31-8 If he said, <f>ⓖ</f>‘The spotted shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore striped.
31-9 Thus God has <f>ⓗ</f>taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
31-10 In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.
31-11 Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am!’
31-12 And he said, ‘Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for <f>ⓘ</f>I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
31-13 I am the God of Bethel, <f>ⓙ</f>where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now <f>ⓚ</f>arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.’”
31-14 Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, “Is there <f>ⓛ</f>any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?
31-15 Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For <f>ⓜ</f>he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money.
31-16 All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.”
31-17 <pb/>So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
31-18 He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in <f>ⓝ</f>Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.
31-19 Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's <f>ⓞ</f>household gods.
31-20 And Jacob tricked <f>[1]</f> Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee.
31-21 He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the <f>ⓟ</f>Euphrates, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓠ</f>set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.
31-22 <pb/>When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,
31-23 he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.
31-24 But God came to Laban the Aramean <f>ⓡ</f>in a dream by night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, <f>ⓢ</f>either good or bad.”
31-25 <pb/>And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead.
31-26 And Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have <f>ⓣ</f>tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?
31-27 Why did you flee secretly <f>ⓤ</f>and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?
31-28 And why did you not permit me <f>ⓥ</f>to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.
31-29 It is <f>ⓦ</f>in my power to do you harm. But the <f>ⓧ</f>God of your <f>[3]</f> father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, <f>ⓨ</f>either good or bad.’
31-30 And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you <f>ⓩ</f>steal my gods?”
31-31 Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.
31-32 <f>ⓐ</f> Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
31-33 <pb/>So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's.
31-34 Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.
31-35 And she said to her father, “Let not my lord be angry that I cannot <f>ⓑ</f>rise before you, for the way of women is upon me.” So he searched but did not find the household gods.
31-36 <pb/>Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, “What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?
31-37 For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and <f>ⓒ</f>your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.
31-38 These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.
31-39 What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. <f>ⓓ</f>From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
31-40 There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
31-41 These twenty years I have been in your house. <f>ⓔ</f>I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and <f>ⓕ</f>you have changed my wages ten times.
31-42 <f>ⓖ</f> If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the <f>ⓗ</f>Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. <f>ⓘ</f>God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and <f>ⓙ</f>rebuked you last night.”
31-43 <pb/>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?
31-44 Come now, <f>ⓚ</f>let us make a covenant, you and I. <f>ⓛ</f>And let it be a witness between you and me.”
31-45 So Jacob <f>ⓜ</f>took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
31-46 And Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
31-47 Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, <f>[4]</f> but Jacob called it Galeed. <f>[5]</f>
31-48 Laban said, <f>ⓝ</f>“This heap is a witness between you and me today.” Therefore he named it Galeed,
31-49 <f>ⓞ</f> and Mizpah, <f>[6]</f> for he said, “The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight.
31-50 If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, <f>ⓟ</f>God is witness between you and me.”
31-51 <pb/>Then Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.
31-52 <f>ⓠ</f> This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm.
31-53 The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the <f>ⓡ</f>Fear of his father Isaac,
31-54 and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called <f>ⓢ</f>his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.
31-55 <pb/><f>[7]</f> Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed <f>ⓣ</f>his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home.
29-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah <f>[1]</f> the daughter of <f>ⓑ</f>Zechariah.
29-2 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
29-3 <pb/>In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he <f>ⓒ</f>opened the doors of the house of the LORD and repaired them.
29-4 He brought in the priests and the Levites and assembled them in the square on the east
29-5 and said to them, “Hear me, Levites! Now <f>ⓓ</f>consecrate yourselves, and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filth <f>[2]</f> from the Holy Place.
29-6 For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They have forsaken him and <f>ⓔ</f>have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD and turned their backs.
29-7 They also <f>ⓕ</f>shut the doors of the vestibule and put out the lamps and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel.
29-8 Therefore <f>ⓖ</f>the wrath of the LORD came on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has made them <f>ⓗ</f>an object of horror, of astonishment, <f>ⓘ</f>and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.
29-9 For behold, <f>ⓙ</f>our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
29-10 Now <f>ⓚ</f>it is in my heart <f>ⓛ</f>to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, in order that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
29-11 My sons, do not now be negligent, <f>ⓜ</f>for the LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence, to minister to him and to be his ministers and make offerings to him.”
29-12 <pb/>Then the Levites arose, <f>ⓝ</f>Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of <f>ⓞ</f>the Kohathites; and of the sons of <f>ⓟ</f>Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the <f>ⓠ</f>Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;
29-13 and of the sons of <f>ⓡ</f>Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of <f>ⓢ</f>Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
29-14 and of the sons of <f>ⓣ</f>Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of <f>ⓤ</f>Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
29-15 They gathered their brothers and <f>ⓥ</f>consecrated themselves and went in as the king had commanded, <f>ⓦ</f>by the words of the LORD, <f>ⓧ</f>to cleanse the house of the LORD.
29-16 The priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it and carried it out to <f>ⓨ</f>the brook Kidron.
29-17 They began to consecrate <f>ⓩ</f>on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the LORD. Then for eight days they consecrated the house of the LORD, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.
29-18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king and said, “We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the table for the showbread and all its utensils.
29-19 All the utensils <f>ⓐ</f>that King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was faithless, we have made ready and consecrated, and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.”
29-20 <pb/>Then Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the officials of the city and went up to the house of the LORD.
29-21 And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats <f>ⓑ</f>for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
29-22 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood <f>ⓒ</f>and threw it against the altar. And they slaughtered the rams, and their blood was thrown against the altar. And they slaughtered the lambs, and their blood was thrown against the altar.
29-23 Then the goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the assembly, <f>ⓓ</f>and they laid their hands on them,
29-24 and the priests slaughtered them and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, <f>ⓔ</f>to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
29-25 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And he stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres, <f>ⓖ</f>according to the commandment of David and of Gad <f>ⓗ</f>the king's seer and of <f>ⓘ</f>Nathan the prophet, for the commandment was from the LORD through his prophets.
29-26 The Levites stood with <f>ⓙ</f>the instruments of David, <f>ⓚ</f>and the priests with the trumpets.
29-27 Then Hezekiah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, <f>ⓛ</f>the song to the LORD began also, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.
29-28 The whole assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
29-29 When the offering was finished, <f>ⓜ</f>the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.
29-30 And Hezekiah the king and the officials commanded the Levites to sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped.
29-31 <pb/>Then Hezekiah said, <f>ⓝ</f>“You have now consecrated yourselves to <f>[3]</f> the LORD. Come near; bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.” And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all who were <f>ⓞ</f>of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
29-32 The number of the burnt offerings that the assembly brought was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.
29-33 And the consecrated offerings were 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep.
29-34 But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings, so until other priests had consecrated themselves, <f>ⓟ</f>their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was finished — <f>ⓠ</f>for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in consecrating themselves.
29-35 Besides the great number of burnt offerings, there was <f>ⓡ</f>the fat of the peace offerings, and there were <f>ⓢ</f>the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored.
29-36 And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because God had provided for the people, for the thing came about suddenly.
16-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
16-2 “You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.
16-3 For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who fathered them in this land:
16-4 <f>ⓐ</f> They shall die of deadly diseases. <f>ⓑ</f>They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried. <f>ⓒ</f>They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. <f>ⓓ</f>They shall perish by the sword and by famine, <f>ⓔ</f>and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.
16-5 <pb/>“For thus says the LORD: <f>ⓕ</f>Do not enter the house of mourning, or go to lament or grieve for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people, my steadfast love and mercy, declares the LORD.
16-6 Both great and small shall die in this land. <f>ⓖ</f>They shall not be buried, and no one shall lament for them or <f>ⓗ</f>cut himself <f>ⓘ</f>or make himself bald for them.
16-7 No one shall <f>ⓙ</f>break bread for the mourner, to comfort him for the dead, nor shall anyone give him the cup of consolation to drink for his father or his mother.
16-8 You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink.
16-9 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓚ</f>Behold, I will silence in this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
16-10 <pb/>“And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, <f>ⓛ</f>‘Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?’
16-11 then you shall say to them: <f>ⓜ</f>‘Because your fathers have forsaken me, declares the LORD, and <f>ⓝ</f>have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law,
16-12 and because <f>ⓞ</f>you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, <f>ⓟ</f>every one of you follows his stubborn, evil will, refusing to listen to me.
16-13 Therefore <f>ⓠ</f>I will hurl you out of this land into <f>ⓡ</f>a land that neither you nor your fathers have known, <f>ⓢ</f>and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’
16-14 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> “Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it shall no longer be said, <f>ⓤ</f>‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’
16-15 but <f>ⓥ</f>‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel <f>ⓦ</f>out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.’ For <f>ⓧ</f>I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their fathers.
16-16 <pb/>“Behold, <f>ⓨ</f>I am sending for many fishers, declares the LORD, and they shall catch them. And afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out <f>ⓩ</f>of the clefts of the rocks.
16-17 For <f>ⓐ</f>my eyes are on all their ways. <f>ⓑ</f>They are not hidden from me, <f>ⓒ</f>nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
16-18 But first <f>ⓓ</f>I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and <f>ⓔ</f>have filled my inheritance with their abominations.”
16-19 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>my refuge in the day of trouble, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>to you shall the nations come </t><t>from the ends of the earth and say: </t><t>“Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>worthless things in which there is no profit.</t>
16-20 <t>Can man make for himself <f>ⓙ</f>gods? </t><t>Such are not gods!” </t>
16-21 <pb/>“Therefore, behold, I will make them know, this once I will make them know my power and my might, and they shall know that <f>ⓚ</f>my name is the LORD.”
2-1 <pb/>You then, <f>ⓐ</f>my child, <f>ⓑ</f>be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus,
2-2 and <f>ⓒ</f>what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses <f>ⓓ</f>entrust to faithful men, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>who will be able to teach others also.
2-3 <f>ⓕ</f> Share in suffering as <f>ⓖ</f>a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
2-4 No soldier <f>ⓗ</f>gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.
2-5 <f>ⓘ</f> An athlete is not <f>ⓙ</f>crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
2-6 It is <f>ⓚ</f>the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.
2-7 Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
2-8 <pb/>Remember Jesus Christ, <f>ⓛ</f>risen from the dead, the <f>ⓜ</f>offspring of David, <f>ⓝ</f>as preached in my gospel,
2-9 <f>ⓞ</f> for which I am suffering, <f>ⓟ</f>bound with chains as a criminal. But <f>ⓠ</f>the word of God is not bound!
2-10 Therefore <f>ⓡ</f>I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain <f>ⓢ</f>the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with <f>ⓣ</f>eternal glory.
2-11 The saying is <f>ⓤ</f>trustworthy, for: <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f>If we have died with him, we will also <f>ⓦ</f>live with him;</t>
2-12 <t><f>ⓧ</f> if we endure, we will also reign with him; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>if we deny him, he also will deny us;</t>
2-13 <t><f>ⓩ</f> if we are faithless, <f>ⓐ</f>he remains faithful — </t> <pb/>for <f>ⓑ</f>he cannot deny himself.
2-14 <pb/>Remind them of these things, and <f>ⓒ</f>charge them before God <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>not to quarrel about words, <f>ⓔ</f>which does no good, but only ruins the hearers.
2-15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, <f>[3]</f> a worker <f>ⓕ</f>who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
2-16 But <f>ⓖ</f>avoid <f>ⓗ</f>irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,
2-17 and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are <f>ⓘ</f>Hymenaeus and Philetus,
2-18 who have swerved from the truth, <f>ⓙ</f>saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.
2-19 But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: <f>ⓚ</f>“The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let everyone <f>ⓛ</f>who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”
2-20 <pb/>Now in <f>ⓜ</f>a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, <f>ⓝ</f>some for honorable use, some for dishonorable.
2-21 Therefore, <f>ⓞ</f>if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, <f>[4]</f> he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, <f>ⓟ</f>ready for every good work.
2-22 <pb/>So <f>ⓠ</f>flee <f>ⓡ</f>youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with <f>ⓢ</f>those who call on the Lord <f>ⓣ</f>from a pure heart.
2-23 Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant <f>ⓤ</f>controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.
2-24 And <f>ⓥ</f>the Lord's servant <f>[5]</f> must not be quarrelsome but <f>ⓦ</f>kind to everyone, <f>ⓧ</f>able to teach, patiently enduring evil,
2-25 correcting his opponents <f>ⓨ</f>with gentleness. God <f>ⓩ</f>may perhaps grant them repentance <f>ⓐ</f>leading to a knowledge of the truth,
2-26 and they may come to their senses and escape from <f>ⓑ</f>the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.
