21-1 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, <f>ⓐ</f>No one shall make himself unclean for the dead among his people,
21-2 except for his closest relatives, his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother,
21-3 or his virgin sister (who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may make himself unclean).
21-4 He shall not make himself unclean as a husband among his people and so profane himself.
21-5 <f>ⓑ</f> They shall not make bald patches on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts on their body.
21-6 They shall be holy to their God and <f>ⓒ</f>not profane the name of their God. For they offer the LORD's food offerings, <f>ⓓ</f>the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
21-7 <f>ⓔ</f> They shall not marry a prostitute or a woman who has been defiled, neither shall they marry a woman <f>ⓕ</f>divorced from her husband, for the priest is holy to his God.
21-8 You shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for <f>ⓖ</f>I, the LORD, who sanctify you, <f>ⓗ</f>am holy.
21-9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by whoring, profanes her father; <f>ⓘ</f>she shall be burned with fire.
21-10 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> “The priest who is chief among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, <f>ⓚ</f>shall not let the hair of his head hang loose nor tear his clothes.
21-11 He shall not <f>ⓛ</f>go in to any dead bodies nor make himself unclean, even for his father or for his mother.
21-12 <f>ⓜ</f> He shall not go out of the sanctuary, lest he <f>ⓝ</f>profane the sanctuary of his God, for the <f>ⓞ</f>consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am the LORD.
21-13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity. <f>[1]</f>
21-14 A widow, <f>ⓟ</f>or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute, these he shall not marry. But he shall take as his wife a virgin <f>[2]</f> of his own people,
21-15 that he may not profane his offspring among his people, for <f>ⓠ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies him.”
21-16 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
21-17 “Speak to Aaron, saying, None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may <f>ⓡ</f>approach to offer the bread of his God.
21-18 For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, a man <f>ⓢ</f>blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face <f>ⓣ</f>or a limb too long,
21-19 or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand,
21-20 or a hunchback or a dwarf or a man with a <f>ⓤ</f>defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or <f>ⓥ</f>crushed testicles.
21-21 No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to <f>ⓦ</f>offer the LORD's food offerings; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
21-22 He may eat the bread of his God, both of <f>ⓧ</f>the most holy and of the <f>ⓨ</f>holy things,
21-23 but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not <f>ⓩ</f>profane my sanctuaries, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”
21-24 So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.
40-1 <pb/>And the LORD <f>ⓐ</f>said to Job:
40-2 <pb/><t>“Shall a faultfinder <f>ⓑ</f>contend with the Almighty? </t><t>He who argues with God, let him answer it.” </t>
40-3 <pb/>Then Job answered the LORD and said:
40-4 <pb/><t>“Behold, I am <f>ⓒ</f>of small account; what shall I answer you? </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>I lay my hand on my mouth.</t>
40-5 <t>I have spoken <f>ⓔ</f>once, and I will not answer; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>twice, but I will proceed no further.” </t>
40-6 <pb/>Then the LORD <f>ⓖ</f>answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
40-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> “Dress for action <f>[1]</f> like a man; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>I will question you, and you make it known to me.</t>
40-8 <t>Will you even put me in the wrong? </t><t>Will you condemn me that <f>ⓙ</f>you may be in the right?</t>
40-9 <t>Have you <f>ⓚ</f>an arm like God, </t><t>and can you thunder with <f>ⓛ</f>a voice like his? </t>
40-10 <pb/><t>“Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>clothe yourself with glory and splendor.</t>
40-11 <t>Pour out the overflowings of your anger, </t><t>and look on everyone who is <f>ⓝ</f>proud and abase him.</t>
40-12 <t>Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>tread down the wicked <f>ⓟ</f>where they stand.</t>
40-13 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Hide them all in <f>ⓡ</f>the dust together; </t><t>bind their faces in the world below. <f>[2]</f></t>
40-14 <t>Then will I also acknowledge to you </t><t>that your own <f>ⓢ</f>right hand can save you. </t>
40-15 <pb/><t>“Behold, Behemoth, <f>[3]</f> </t><t>which I made as I made you; </t><t>he eats <f>ⓣ</f>grass like an ox.</t>
40-16 <t>Behold, his strength in his loins, </t><t>and his power in the muscles of his belly.</t>
40-17 <t>He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; </t><t>the sinews of his thighs are knit together.</t>
40-18 <t>His bones are tubes of bronze, </t><t>his limbs like bars of iron. </t>
40-19 <pb/><t>“He is <f>ⓤ</f>the first of <f>ⓥ</f>the works <f>[4]</f> of God; </t><t>let him who made him bring near his sword!</t>
40-20 <t>For the mountains yield food for him </t><t>where all the wild beasts play.</t>
40-21 <t>Under the lotus plants he lies, </t><t>in the shelter of <f>ⓦ</f>the reeds and in the marsh.</t>
40-22 <t>For his shade the lotus trees cover him; </t><t>the willows of the brook surround him.</t>
40-23 <t>Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; </t><t>he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth.</t>
40-24 <t>Can one take him by his eyes, <f>[5]</f> </t><t>or pierce his nose with a snare? </t>
39-1 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>prophesy against <f>ⓒ</f>Gog and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, <f>ⓓ</f>I am against you, O Gog, <f>ⓔ</f>chief prince of <f>ⓕ</f>Meshech <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>Tubal.
39-2 <f>ⓗ</f> And I will turn you about and drive you forward, <f>[2]</f> and bring you up from <f>ⓘ</f>the uttermost parts of the north, and lead you against the <f>ⓙ</f>mountains of Israel.
39-3 Then <f>ⓚ</f>I will strike your bow from your left hand, and <f>ⓛ</f>will make your arrows drop out of your right hand.
39-4 <f>ⓜ</f> You shall fall on <f>ⓝ</f>the mountains of Israel, you and all your <f>ⓞ</f>hordes and the peoples who are with you. <f>ⓟ</f>I will give you to birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
39-5 You shall fall in the open field, for <f>ⓠ</f>I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
39-6 <f>ⓡ</f> I will send fire on <f>ⓢ</f>Magog and on those <f>ⓣ</f>who dwell securely in <f>ⓤ</f>the coastlands, and <f>ⓥ</f>they shall know that I am the LORD.
39-7 <pb/>“And <f>ⓦ</f>my holy name I will make known in the midst of my people Israel, and <f>ⓧ</f>I will not let my holy name be profaned anymore. And <f>ⓨ</f>the nations shall know that I am <f>ⓩ</f>the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
39-8 <f>ⓐ</f> Behold, it is coming and it will be brought about, declares the Lord GOD. That is the day <f>ⓑ</f>of which I have spoken.
39-9 <pb/>“Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and <f>ⓒ</f>make fires of the weapons and burn them, shields and bucklers, bow and arrows, <f>ⓓ</f>clubs <f>[3]</f> and spears; and they will make fires of them for seven years,
39-10 so that they will not need to take wood out of the field or cut down any out of the forests, for <f>ⓔ</f>they will make their fires of the weapons. <f>ⓕ</f>They will seize the spoil of those who despoiled them, and plunder those who plundered them, declares the Lord GOD.
39-11 <pb/>“On that day I will give to <f>ⓖ</f>Gog a place for burial in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers, east of the sea. It will block the travelers, for there Gog and all his multitude will be buried. It will be called the Valley of <f>ⓗ</f>Hamon-gog. <f>[4]</f>
39-12 For <f>ⓘ</f>seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order <f>ⓙ</f>to cleanse the land.
39-13 All the people of the land will bury them, and it will bring them renown on the day that <f>ⓚ</f>I show my glory, declares the Lord GOD.
39-14 They will set apart men to travel through the land regularly and bury those travelers remaining on the face of the land, so as <f>ⓛ</f>to cleanse it. At <f>[5]</f> the end of <f>ⓜ</f>seven months they will make their search.
39-15 And when these travel through the land and anyone sees a human bone, then he shall set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of <f>ⓝ</f>Hamon-gog.
39-16 (Hamonah <f>[6]</f> is also the name of the city.) Thus shall they cleanse the land.
39-17 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓞ</f>son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓟ</f>Speak to <f>ⓠ</f>the birds of every sort and to <f>ⓡ</f>all beasts of the field: ‘Assemble and come, gather from all around to <f>ⓢ</f>the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great sacrificial feast on the mountains of Israel, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood.
39-18 <f>ⓣ</f> You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth — of rams, of lambs, and of he-goats, of bulls, all of them <f>ⓤ</f>fat beasts of Bashan.
39-19 And you shall eat fat till you are filled, and drink blood till you are drunk, at the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you.
39-20 And you shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men and all kinds of warriors,’ declares the Lord GOD.
39-21 <pb/>“And <f>ⓥ</f>I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see <f>ⓦ</f>my judgment that I have executed, and <f>ⓧ</f>my hand that I have laid on them.
39-22 <f>ⓨ</f> The house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God, from that day forward.
39-23 And <f>ⓩ</f>the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they dealt so treacherously with me that <f>ⓐ</f>I hid my face from them and <f>ⓑ</f>gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword.
39-24 I dealt with them <f>ⓒ</f>according to their uncleanness and their transgressions, and hid my face from them.
39-25 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now <f>ⓓ</f>I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on <f>ⓔ</f>the whole house of Israel, and <f>ⓕ</f>I will be jealous for my holy name.
39-26 They shall <f>ⓖ</f>forget their shame and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when <f>ⓗ</f>they dwell securely in their land with <f>ⓘ</f>none to make them afraid,
39-27 <f>ⓙ</f> when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies' lands, <f>ⓚ</f>and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations.
39-28 <f>ⓛ</f> Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, because I sent them into exile among the nations and then assembled them into their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore.
39-29 <f>ⓜ</f> And I will not hide my face anymore from them, when <f>ⓝ</f>I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.”
