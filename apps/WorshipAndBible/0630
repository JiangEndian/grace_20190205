Numbers 9-1 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, <f>ⓐ</f>in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers 9-2 “Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.
Numbers 9-3 <f>ⓑ</f> On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it.”
Numbers 9-4 So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
Numbers 9-5 And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.
Numbers 9-6 And there were certain men who were <f>ⓒ</f>unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and <f>ⓓ</f>they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
Numbers 9-7 And those men said to him, “We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the LORD's <f>ⓔ</f>offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?”
Numbers 9-8 And Moses said to them, “Wait, that <f>ⓕ</f>I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.”
Numbers 9-9 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 9-10 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the LORD.
Numbers 9-11 <f>ⓖ</f> In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. <f>ⓗ</f>They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Numbers 9-12 <f>ⓘ</f> They shall leave none of it until the morning, <f>ⓙ</f>nor break any of its bones; <f>ⓚ</f>according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it.
Numbers 9-13 But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, <f>ⓛ</f>that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the LORD's <f>ⓜ</f>offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.
Numbers 9-14 And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. <f>ⓝ</f>You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native.”
Numbers 9-15 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And <f>ⓟ</f>at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.
Numbers 9-16 So it was always: the cloud covered it by day <f>[1]</f> and the appearance of fire by night.
Numbers 9-17 And whenever the cloud <f>ⓠ</f>lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped.
Numbers 9-18 At the command of the LORD the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the LORD they camped. <f>ⓡ</f>As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
Numbers 9-19 Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel <f>ⓢ</f>kept the charge of the LORD and did not set out.
Numbers 9-20 Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp; then according to the command of the LORD they set out.
Numbers 9-21 And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out.
Numbers 9-22 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel <f>ⓣ</f>remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out.
Numbers 9-23 At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out. <f>ⓤ</f>They kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by Moses.

Daniel 6-1 <pb/>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom <f>ⓐ</f>120 <f>ⓑ</f>satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom;
Daniel 6-2 and over them <f>ⓒ</f>three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these <f>ⓓ</f>satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss.
Daniel 6-3 Then this Daniel became <f>ⓔ</f>distinguished above all <f>ⓕ</f>the other high officials and <f>ⓖ</f>satraps, because <f>ⓗ</f>an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned <f>ⓘ</f>to set him over the whole kingdom.
Daniel 6-4 Then <f>ⓙ</f>the high officials and <f>ⓚ</f>the satraps <f>ⓛ</f>sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, <f>ⓜ</f>but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, <f>ⓝ</f>and no error or fault was found in him.
Daniel 6-5 Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”
Daniel 6-6 <pb/>Then these <f>ⓞ</f>high officials and <f>ⓟ</f>satraps came by agreement <f>[1]</f> to the king and said to him, “O <f>ⓠ</f>King Darius, live forever!
Daniel 6-7 All the <f>ⓡ</f>high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the <f>ⓢ</f>counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an <f>ⓣ</f>injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.
Daniel 6-8 Now, O king, establish <f>ⓤ</f>the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to <f>ⓥ</f>the law of <f>ⓦ</f>the Medes and the Persians, <f>ⓧ</f>which cannot be revoked.”
Daniel 6-9 Therefore King Darius signed the document and <f>ⓨ</f>injunction.
Daniel 6-10 <pb/>When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where <f>ⓩ</f>he had windows in his upper chamber open <f>ⓐ</f>toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees <f>ⓑ</f>three times a day and prayed and <f>ⓒ</f>gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.
Daniel 6-11 Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God.
Daniel 6-12 Then they <f>ⓓ</f>came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, “O king! Did you not sign <f>ⓔ</f>an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered and said, “The thing stands fast, according to the law of <f>ⓕ</f>the Medes and Persians, <f>ⓖ</f>which cannot be revoked.”
Daniel 6-13 Then they answered and said before the king, <f>ⓗ</f>“Daniel, who is one <f>ⓘ</f>of the exiles <f>ⓙ</f>from Judah, <f>ⓚ</f>pays no attention to you, O king, or <f>ⓛ</f>the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition <f>ⓜ</f>three times a day.”
Daniel 6-14 <pb/>Then <f>ⓝ</f>the king, when he heard these words, <f>ⓞ</f>was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him.
Daniel 6-15 Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no <f>ⓟ</f>injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.”
Daniel 6-16 <pb/>Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared <f>[2]</f> to Daniel, “May <f>ⓠ</f>your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!”
Daniel 6-17 <f>ⓡ</f> And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, <f>ⓢ</f>and the king sealed it <f>ⓣ</f>with his own signet and with the signet of his <f>ⓤ</f>lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
Daniel 6-18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; <f>ⓥ</f>no diversions were brought to him, and <f>ⓦ</f>sleep fled from him.
Daniel 6-19 <pb/>Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions.
Daniel 6-20 As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of <f>ⓧ</f>the living God, <f>ⓨ</f>has your God, whom you serve continually, <f>ⓩ</f>been able to deliver you from the lions?”
Daniel 6-21 Then Daniel said to the king, <f>ⓐ</f>“O king, live forever!
Daniel 6-22 My God <f>ⓑ</f>sent his angel <f>ⓒ</f>and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless <f>ⓓ</f>before him; <f>ⓔ</f>and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”
Daniel 6-23 Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and <f>ⓕ</f>no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
Daniel 6-24 And the king commanded, and <f>ⓖ</f>those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions — they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.
Daniel 6-25 <pb/>Then King Darius wrote to all <f>ⓗ</f>the peoples, nations, and languages <f>ⓘ</f>that dwell in all the earth: <f>ⓙ</f>“Peace be multiplied to you.
Daniel 6-26 <f>ⓚ</f> I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion <f>ⓛ</f>people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, <pb/><t>for <f>ⓜ</f>he is <f>ⓝ</f>the living God, </t><t>enduring forever; </t><t>his kingdom shall never be destroyed, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and his dominion shall be <f>ⓟ</f>to the end.</t>
Daniel 6-27 <t>He delivers and rescues; </t><t>he works <f>ⓠ</f>signs and wonders </t><t>in heaven and on earth, </t><t>he who has <f>ⓡ</f>saved Daniel </t><t>from the power of the lions.” </t>
Daniel 6-28 <pb/>So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and <f>ⓢ</f>the reign of <f>ⓣ</f>Cyrus the Persian.
