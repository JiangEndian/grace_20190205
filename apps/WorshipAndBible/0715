24-1 <pb/>When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go, as at <f>ⓐ</f>other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness.
24-2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel <f>ⓑ</f>camping tribe by tribe. And <f>ⓒ</f>the Spirit of God came upon him,
24-3 and he <f>ⓓ</f>took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, </t><t>the oracle of the man whose eye is opened, <f>[1]</f></t>
24-4 <t>the oracle of him who hears the words of God, </t><t>who sees the vision of the Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>falling down with his eyes uncovered:</t>
24-5 <t>How lovely are your tents, O Jacob, </t><t>your encampments, O Israel!</t>
24-6 <t>Like palm groves <f>[2]</f> that stretch afar, </t><t>like gardens beside a river, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>like aloes <f>ⓖ</f>that the LORD has planted, </t><t>like cedar trees beside the waters.</t>
24-7 <t>Water shall flow from his buckets, </t><t>and his seed shall be <f>ⓗ</f>in many waters; </t><t>his king shall be higher than <f>ⓘ</f>Agag, </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>his kingdom shall be exalted.</t>
24-8 <t>God brings him out of Egypt </t><t>and is for him like the <f>ⓚ</f>horns of the wild ox; </t><t>he shall <f>ⓛ</f>eat up the nations, his adversaries, </t><t>and shall <f>ⓜ</f>break their bones in pieces </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>pierce them through with his arrows.</t>
24-9 <t>He crouched, he lay down like a lion </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>like a lioness; who will rouse him up? </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>Blessed are those who bless you, </t><t>and cursed are those who curse you.” </t>
24-10 <pb/>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he <f>ⓠ</f>struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, <f>ⓡ</f>“I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times.
24-11 Therefore now flee to your own place. I said, <f>ⓢ</f>‘I will certainly honor you,’ but the LORD has held you back from honor.”
24-12 And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,
24-13 <f>ⓣ</f> ‘If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad <f>ⓤ</f>of my own will. What the LORD speaks, that will I speak’?
24-14 And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, <f>ⓥ</f>I will let you know what this people will do to your people <f>ⓦ</f>in the latter days.”
24-15 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> And he took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, </t><t>the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,</t>
24-16 <t>the oracle of him who hears the words of God, </t><t>and knows the knowledge of <f>ⓨ</f>the Most High, </t><t>who sees the vision of the Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>falling down with his eyes uncovered:</t>
24-17 <t><f>ⓐ</f> I see him, but not now; </t><t>I behold him, but not near: </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>a star shall come out of Jacob, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>a scepter shall rise out of Israel; </t><t>it shall <f>ⓓ</f>crush the forehead <f>[3]</f> of Moab </t><t>and break down all the sons of Sheth.</t>
24-18 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Edom shall be dispossessed; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>Seir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed. </t><t>Israel is doing valiantly.</t>
24-19 <t>And one from Jacob shall exercise dominion </t><t>and destroy the survivors of cities!” </t>
24-20 <pb/>Then he looked on Amalek and <f>ⓖ</f>took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“Amalek was the first among the nations, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>but its end is utter destruction.” </t>
24-21 <pb/>And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“Enduring is your dwelling place, </t><t>and your nest is set in the rock.</t>
24-22 <t>Nevertheless, Kain shall be burned </t><t>when Asshur takes you away captive.” </t>
24-23 <pb/>And he took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“Alas, who shall live when God does this?</t>
24-24 <t>But ships shall come from <f>ⓘ</f>Kittim </t><t>and shall afflict Asshur and <f>ⓙ</f>Eber; </t><t>and he too <f>ⓚ</f>shall come to utter destruction.” </t>
24-25 <pb/>Then Balaam rose and <f>ⓛ</f>went back to his place. And Balak also went his way.
28-1 <pb/><t>To you, O LORD, I call; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>my rock, be not deaf to me, </t><t>lest, if you <f>ⓑ</f>be silent to me, </t><t>I become like those who <f>ⓒ</f>go down to the pit.</t>
28-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Hear the voice of my pleas for mercy, </t><t>when I cry to you for help, </t><t>when I <f>ⓔ</f>lift up my hands </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>toward your most holy sanctuary. <f>[1]</f> </t>
28-3 <pb/><t>Do not <f>ⓖ</f>drag me off with the wicked, </t><t>with the workers of evil, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>who speak peace with their neighbors </t><t>while evil is in their hearts.</t>
28-4 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Give to them according to their work </t><t>and according to the evil of their deeds; </t><t>give to them according to the work of their hands; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>render them their due reward.</t>
28-5 <t>Because they <f>ⓚ</f>do not regard the works of the LORD </t><t>or the work of his hands, </t><t>he will tear them down and build them up no more. </t>
28-6 <pb/><t>Blessed be the LORD! </t><t>For he has <f>ⓛ</f>heard the voice of my pleas for mercy.</t>
28-7 <t>The LORD is my strength and <f>ⓜ</f>my shield; </t><t>in him my heart <f>ⓝ</f>trusts, and I am helped; </t><t>my heart exults, </t><t>and with my <f>ⓞ</f>song I give thanks to him. </t>
28-8 <pb/><t>The LORD is the strength of his people; <f>[2]</f> </t><t>he is <f>ⓟ</f>the saving refuge of his anointed.</t>
28-9 <t>Oh, save your people and bless <f>ⓠ</f>your heritage! </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>Be their shepherd and <f>ⓢ</f>carry them forever. </t>
9-1 <pb/><t>Rejoice not, O Israel! </t><t>Exult not like the peoples; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>for you have played the whore, forsaking your God. </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>You have loved a prostitute's wages </t><t>on all threshing floors.</t>
9-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Threshing floor and wine vat shall not feed them, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>the new wine shall fail them.</t>
9-3 <t>They shall not remain in <f>ⓔ</f>the land of the LORD, </t><t>but <f>ⓕ</f>Ephraim shall return to Egypt, </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>they shall eat unclean food in Assyria. </t>
9-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> They shall not pour drink offerings of wine to the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>and their sacrifices shall not please him. </t><t>It shall be like <f>ⓙ</f>mourners' bread to them; </t><t>all who eat of it shall be defiled; </t><t>for their bread shall be for their hunger only; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>it shall not come to the house of the LORD. </t>
9-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> What will you do on the day of the appointed festival, </t><t>and on the day of the feast of the LORD?</t>
9-6 <t>For behold, they are going away from destruction; </t><t>but <f>ⓜ</f>Egypt shall gather them; </t><t>Memphis shall bury them. </t><t>Nettles shall possess <f>ⓝ</f>their precious things of silver; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>thorns shall be in their tents. </t>
9-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> The days of punishment have come; </t><t>the days of recompense have come; </t><t>Israel shall know it. </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>The prophet is a fool; </t><t>the man of the spirit is mad, </t><t>because of your great iniquity </t><t>and great hatred.</t>
9-8 <t>The prophet is <f>ⓡ</f>the watchman of Ephraim with my God; </t><t>yet <f>ⓢ</f>a fowler's snare is on all his ways, </t><t>and hatred in the house of his God.</t>
9-9 <t><f>ⓣ</f> They have deeply corrupted themselves </t><t>as <f>ⓤ</f>in the days of Gibeah: </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>he will remember their iniquity; </t><t>he will punish their sins. </t>
9-10 <pb/><t>Like grapes in the wilderness, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>I found Israel. </t><t>Like the first fruit on the fig tree </t><t>in its first season, </t><t>I saw your fathers. </t><t>But <f>ⓧ</f>they came to Baal-peor </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>consecrated themselves to the thing of shame, </t><t>and <f>ⓩ</f>became detestable like the thing they loved.</t>
9-11 <t>Ephraim's <f>ⓐ</f>glory shall fly away like a bird — </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>no birth, no pregnancy, no conception!</t>
9-12 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Even if they bring up children, </t><t>I will bereave them till none is left. </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>Woe to them </t><t>when <f>ⓔ</f>I depart from them!</t>
9-13 <t>Ephraim, <f>ⓕ</f>as I have seen, was like a young palm <f>[1]</f> planted in a meadow; </t><t>but <f>ⓖ</f>Ephraim must lead his children out to slaughter. <f>[2]</f></t>
9-14 <t>Give them, O LORD — </t><t>what will you give? </t><t>Give them <f>ⓗ</f>a miscarrying womb </t><t>and dry breasts. </t>
9-15 <pb/><t>Every evil of theirs is in <f>ⓘ</f>Gilgal; </t><t>there I began to hate them. </t><t>Because of the wickedness of their deeds </t><t>I will drive them out of my house. </t><t>I will love them no more; </t><t>all <f>ⓙ</f>their princes are <f>ⓚ</f>rebels. </t>
9-16 <pb/><t>Ephraim is stricken; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>their root is dried up; </t><t>they shall bear no fruit. </t><t>Even <f>ⓜ</f>though they give birth, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>I will put their beloved children to death.</t>
9-17 <t><f>ⓞ</f> My God will reject them </t><t>because they have not listened to him; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>they shall be wanderers among the nations. </t>
