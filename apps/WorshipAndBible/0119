16-1 <pb/>In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign.
16-2 Ahaz was <f>ⓐ</f>twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God, as his father David had done,
16-3 but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. <f>ⓑ</f>He even burned his son as an offering, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>according to the despicable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
16-4 <f>ⓓ</f> And he sacrificed and made offerings <f>ⓔ</f>on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
16-5 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Then Rezin king of Syria and <f>ⓖ</f>Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to wage war on Jerusalem, and they besieged Ahaz <f>ⓗ</f>but could not conquer him.
16-6 At that time Rezin the king of Syria recovered <f>ⓘ</f>Elath for Syria and drove the men of Judah from <f>ⓙ</f>Elath, and the Edomites came to Elath, where they dwell to this day.
16-7 <f>ⓚ</f> So Ahaz sent messengers to <f>ⓛ</f>Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me.”
16-8 Ahaz also <f>ⓜ</f>took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD and in the treasures of the king's house and sent a present to the king of Assyria.
16-9 <f>ⓝ</f> And the king of Assyria listened to him. The king of Assyria marched up against Damascus <f>ⓞ</f>and took it, carrying its people captive to <f>ⓟ</f>Kir, and he killed Rezin.
16-10 <pb/>When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet <f>ⓠ</f>Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, he saw the altar that was at Damascus. And King Ahaz sent to <f>ⓡ</f>Uriah the priest a model of the altar, and its pattern, exact in all its details.
16-11 And Uriah the priest built the altar; in accordance with all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Uriah the priest made it, before King Ahaz arrived from Damascus.
16-12 And when the king came from Damascus, the king viewed the altar. <f>ⓢ</f>Then the king drew near to the altar and went up on it
16-13 and burned his burnt offering and his grain offering and poured his drink offering and threw the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.
16-14 And <f>ⓣ</f>the bronze altar that was before the LORD he removed <f>ⓤ</f>from the front of the house, from the place between <f>ⓥ</f>his altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of <f>ⓦ</f>his altar.
16-15 And King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn <f>ⓧ</f>the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering and the king's burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering and their drink offering. And throw on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice, but <f>ⓨ</f>the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”
16-16 Uriah the priest did all this, as King Ahaz commanded.
16-17 <pb/>And King Ahaz cut off the frames of the stands and removed the basin from them, and he took down <f>ⓩ</f>the sea <f>[2]</f> from off the bronze oxen that were under it and put it on a stone pedestal.
16-18 And the covered way for the Sabbath that had been built inside the house and the outer entrance for the king he caused to go around the house of the LORD, because of the king of Assyria.
16-19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz that he did, are they not written <f>ⓐ</f>in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
16-20 And Ahaz slept with his fathers and <f>ⓑ</f>was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
15-1 <pb/>An <f>ⓐ</f>oracle concerning <f>ⓑ</f>Moab. <pb/><t>Because <f>ⓒ</f>Ar of Moab is laid waste in a night, </t><t>Moab is undone; </t><t>because <f>ⓓ</f>Kir of Moab is laid waste in a night, </t><t>Moab is undone.</t>
15-2 <t>He has gone up to the temple, <f>[1]</f> and to <f>ⓔ</f>Dibon, </t><t>to the high places <f>[2]</f> to weep; </t><t>over <f>ⓕ</f>Nebo and over <f>ⓖ</f>Medeba </t><t>Moab <f>ⓗ</f>wails. </t><t>On every head is <f>ⓘ</f>baldness; </t><t>every beard is shorn;</t>
15-3 <t>in the streets they wear sackcloth; </t><t>on the housetops and in the squares </t><t>everyone wails and melts in tears.</t>
15-4 <t><f>ⓙ</f> Heshbon and <f>ⓚ</f>Elealeh cry out; </t><t>their voice is heard as far as <f>ⓛ</f>Jahaz; </t><t>therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; </t><t>his soul trembles.</t>
15-5 <t>My heart cries out for Moab; </t><t>her fugitives flee to Zoar, </t><t>to <f>ⓜ</f>Eglath-shelishiyah. </t><t>For at the <f>ⓝ</f>ascent of Luhith </t><t>they go up weeping; </t><t>on the road to <f>ⓞ</f>Horonaim </t><t>they raise a cry of destruction;</t>
15-6 <t>the waters of <f>ⓟ</f>Nimrim </t><t>are a desolation; </t><t>the grass is withered, the vegetation fails, </t><t>the greenery is no more.</t>
15-7 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Therefore the abundance they have gained </t><t>and what they have laid up </t><t>they carry away </t><t>over the Brook of the Willows.</t>
15-8 <t>For a cry has gone </t><t>around the land of Moab; </t><t>her wailing reaches to Eglaim; </t><t>her wailing reaches to Beer-elim.</t>
15-9 <t>For the waters of <f>ⓡ</f>Dibon <f>[3]</f> are full of blood; </t><t>for I will bring upon Dibon even more, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>a lion for those of Moab who escape, </t><t>for the remnant of the land. </t>
13-1 <pb/>Let every person <f>ⓐ</f>be subject to the governing authorities. For <f>ⓑ</f>there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.
13-2 Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.
13-3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you <f>ⓒ</f>will receive his approval,
13-4 for <f>ⓓ</f>he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, <f>ⓔ</f>an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.
13-5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also <f>ⓕ</f>for the sake of conscience.
13-6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.
13-7 <f>ⓖ</f> Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.
13-8 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for <f>ⓘ</f>the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
13-9 For the commandments, <f>ⓙ</f>“You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: <f>ⓚ</f>“You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
13-10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore <f>ⓛ</f>love is the fulfilling of the law.
13-11 <pb/>Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you <f>ⓜ</f>to wake from sleep. <f>ⓝ</f>For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.
13-12 <f>ⓞ</f> The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us <f>ⓟ</f>cast off <f>ⓠ</f>the works of darkness and <f>ⓡ</f>put on the armor of light.
13-13 <f>ⓢ</f> Let us walk properly as in the daytime, <f>ⓣ</f>not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, <f>ⓤ</f>not in quarreling and jealousy.
13-14 But <f>ⓥ</f>put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, <f>ⓦ</f>to gratify its desires.
