41-1 <pb/>After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,
41-2 and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows, attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass.
41-3 And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
41-4 And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke.
41-5 And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.
41-6 And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and <f>ⓐ</f>blighted by the east wind.
41-7 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
41-8 So in the morning <f>ⓑ</f>his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the <f>ⓒ</f>magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
41-9 <pb/>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “I remember my offenses today.
41-10 When Pharaoh was <f>ⓓ</f>angry with his servants <f>ⓔ</f>and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,
41-11 <f>ⓕ</f> we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation.
41-12 A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, <f>ⓖ</f>he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.
41-13 And <f>ⓗ</f>as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.”
41-14 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they <f>ⓙ</f>quickly brought him <f>ⓚ</f>out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.
41-15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. <f>ⓛ</f>I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
41-16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, <f>ⓜ</f>“It is not in me; <f>ⓝ</f>God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.” <f>[1]</f>
41-17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, <f>ⓞ</f>in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile.
41-18 Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass.
41-19 Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.
41-20 And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows,
41-21 but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke.
41-22 I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good.
41-23 Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,
41-24 and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And <f>ⓟ</f>I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”
41-25 <pb/>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one; <f>ⓠ</f>God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
41-26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one.
41-27 The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also <f>ⓡ</f>seven years of famine.
41-28 It is as I told Pharaoh; <f>ⓢ</f>God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
41-29 There will come <f>ⓣ</f>seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,
41-30 but after them there will arise <f>ⓤ</f>seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. <f>ⓥ</f>The famine will consume the land,
41-31 and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe.
41-32 And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the <f>ⓦ</f>thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about.
41-33 Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
41-34 Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land <f>[2]</f> of Egypt during the seven plentiful years.
41-35 And <f>ⓧ</f>let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
41-36 That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.”
41-37 <pb/>This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.
41-38 And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this, <f>ⓨ</f>in whom is the Spirit of God?” <f>[3]</f>
41-39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are.
41-40 <f>ⓩ</f> You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. <f>[4]</f> Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.”
41-41 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, <f>ⓐ</f>I have set you over all the land of Egypt.”
41-42 Then Pharaoh <f>ⓑ</f>took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and <f>ⓒ</f>clothed him in garments of fine linen <f>ⓓ</f>and put a gold chain about his neck.
41-43 And he made him ride in his second chariot. <f>ⓔ</f>And they called out before him, “Bow the knee!” <f>[5]</f> Thus he set him <f>ⓕ</f>over all the land of Egypt.
41-44 Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and <f>ⓖ</f>without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”
41-45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
41-46 <pb/>Joseph was thirty years old when he <f>ⓗ</f>entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.
41-47 During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly,
41-48 and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it.
41-49 And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, <f>ⓘ</f>like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.
41-50 <pb/>Before the year of famine came, <f>ⓙ</f>two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him.
41-51 Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. “For,” he said, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house.” <f>[6]</f>
41-52 The name of the second he called Ephraim, “For God has <f>ⓚ</f>made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.” <f>[7]</f>
41-53 <pb/>The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end,
41-54 and <f>ⓛ</f>the seven years of famine began to come, <f>ⓜ</f>as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
41-55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”
41-56 <pb/>So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses <f>[8]</f> and <f>ⓝ</f>sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
41-57 Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe <f>ⓞ</f>over all the earth.
3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> When the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem.
3-2 Then arose Jeshua the son of Jozadak, with his fellow priests, and <f>ⓑ</f>Zerubbabel the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Shealtiel with his kinsmen, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, <f>ⓓ</f>as it is written in the Law of Moses the <f>ⓔ</f>man of God.
3-3 They set the altar in its place, <f>ⓕ</f>for fear was on them because of the peoples of the lands, and <f>ⓖ</f>they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening.
3-4 <f>ⓗ</f> And they kept the Feast of Booths, <f>ⓘ</f>as it is written, <f>ⓙ</f>and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the rule, as each day required,
3-5 and after that the regular burnt <f>ⓚ</f>offerings, the offerings at the new moon <f>ⓛ</f>and at all the appointed feasts of the LORD, and the offerings of everyone who made a freewill offering to the LORD.
3-6 From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
3-7 So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, <f>ⓜ</f>and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians <f>ⓝ</f>to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, <f>ⓞ</f>according to the grant that they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
3-8 <pb/>Now in the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, <f>ⓟ</f>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and <f>ⓠ</f>Jeshua the son of Jozadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their kinsmen, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity. They <f>ⓡ</f>appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to <f>ⓢ</f>supervise the work of the house of the LORD.
3-9 And <f>ⓣ</f>Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, and Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together <f>ⓤ</f>supervised the workmen in the house of God, along with the <f>ⓥ</f>sons of Henadad and the Levites, their sons and brothers.
3-10 <pb/>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments came forward with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, <f>ⓦ</f>according to the directions of David king of Israel.
3-11 And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f>“For he is good, </t><t>for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel.” </t> <pb/>And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
3-12 But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' houses, <f>ⓨ</f>old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid, though many shouted aloud for joy,
3-13 so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people's weeping, for the people shouted with a great shout, and the sound was heard far away.
26-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the beginning of the reign of <f>ⓑ</f>Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD:
26-2 “Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓒ</f>Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to worship in the house of the LORD <f>ⓓ</f>all the words that I command you to speak to them; <f>ⓔ</f>do not hold back a word.
26-3 <f>ⓕ</f> It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, <f>ⓖ</f>that I may relent of the disaster that I intend to do to them <f>ⓗ</f>because of their evil deeds.
26-4 You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓘ</f>If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you,
26-5 <f>ⓙ</f> and to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you <f>ⓚ</f>urgently, <f>ⓛ</f>though you have not listened,
26-6 then I will make this house <f>ⓜ</f>like Shiloh, and I will make this city <f>ⓝ</f>a curse for all the nations of the earth.’”
26-7 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
26-8 And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then <f>ⓟ</f>the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, “You shall die!
26-9 Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘This house shall be <f>ⓠ</f>like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, <f>ⓡ</f>without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
26-10 <pb/>When <f>ⓢ</f>the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD and took their seat in the <f>ⓣ</f>entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD.
26-11 Then <f>ⓤ</f>the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, <f>ⓥ</f>“This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”
26-12 <pb/>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.
26-13 Now therefore <f>ⓦ</f>mend your ways and your deeds, <f>ⓧ</f>and obey the voice of the LORD your God, <f>ⓨ</f>and the LORD will relent of the disaster that he has pronounced against you.
26-14 <f>ⓩ</f> But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you.
26-15 Only know for certain that if you put me to death, <f>ⓐ</f>you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.”
26-16 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, <f>ⓒ</f>“This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.”
26-17 <f>ⓓ</f> And certain of <f>ⓔ</f>the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying,
26-18 “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f>“‘Zion shall be plowed as a field; </t><t>Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, </t><t>and the mountain of the house a wooded height.’ </t>
26-19 <pb/>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? <f>ⓖ</f>Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, <f>ⓗ</f>and did not the LORD relent of the disaster that he had pronounced against them? <f>ⓘ</f>But we are about to bring great disaster upon ourselves.”
26-20 <pb/>There was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from <f>ⓙ</f>Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah.
26-21 And when <f>ⓚ</f>King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt.
26-22 Then <f>ⓛ</f>King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, <f>ⓜ</f>Elnathan the son of <f>ⓝ</f>Achbor and others with him,
26-23 and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, <f>ⓞ</f>who struck him down with the sword and dumped his dead body into the burial place of the common people.
26-24 <pb/>But the hand of <f>ⓟ</f>Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.
4-1 <pb/>Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem <f>ⓐ</f>to have failed to reach it.
4-2 For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because <f>ⓑ</f>they were not united by faith with those who listened. <f>[1]</f>
4-3 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“As I swore in my wrath, </t><t>‘They shall not enter my rest,’” </t> <pb/>although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.
4-4 For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: <f>ⓓ</f>“And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”
4-5 And again in this passage he said, <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f>“They shall not enter my rest.” </t>
4-6 <pb/>Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news <f>ⓕ</f>failed to enter because of disobedience,
4-7 again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“Today, if you hear his voice, </t><t>do not harden your hearts.” </t>
4-8 <pb/>For if Joshua had given them rest, God <f>[2]</f> would not have spoken of another day later on.
4-9 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,
4-10 for whoever has entered God's rest has also <f>ⓗ</f>rested from his works as God did from his.
4-11 <pb/>Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so <f>ⓘ</f>that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.
4-12 For <f>ⓙ</f>the word of God is living and <f>ⓚ</f>active, <f>ⓛ</f>sharper than any <f>ⓜ</f>two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and <f>ⓝ</f>discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
4-13 And <f>ⓞ</f>no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are <f>ⓟ</f>naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
4-14 <pb/>Since then we have <f>ⓠ</f>a great high priest <f>ⓡ</f>who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, <f>ⓢ</f>let us hold fast our confession.
4-15 For we do not have a high priest <f>ⓣ</f>who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been <f>ⓤ</f>tempted as we are, <f>ⓥ</f>yet without sin.
4-16 <f>ⓦ</f> Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
