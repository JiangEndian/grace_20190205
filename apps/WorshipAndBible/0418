3-1 <pb/>Now Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the <f>ⓐ</f>mountain of God.
3-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And <f>ⓒ</f>the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed.
3-3 And Moses said, “I will turn aside to see this great sight, why the bush is not burned.”
3-4 When the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, <f>ⓓ</f>God called to him <f>ⓔ</f>out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”
3-5 Then he said, “Do not come near; <f>ⓕ</f>take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.”
3-6 And he said, <f>ⓖ</f>“I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for <f>ⓗ</f>he was afraid to look at God.
3-7 <pb/>Then the LORD said, <f>ⓘ</f>“I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their <f>ⓙ</f>taskmasters. I know their sufferings,
3-8 and <f>ⓚ</f>I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and <f>ⓛ</f>to bring them up out of that land to a <f>ⓜ</f>good and broad land, a land <f>ⓝ</f>flowing with milk and honey, to the place of <f>ⓞ</f>the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
3-9 And now, behold, <f>ⓟ</f>the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the <f>ⓠ</f>oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
3-10 <f>ⓡ</f> Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”
3-11 But Moses said to God, <f>ⓢ</f>“Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”
3-12 He said, <f>ⓣ</f>“But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, <f>ⓤ</f>you shall serve God on this mountain.”
3-13 <pb/>Then Moses said to God, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?”
3-14 God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” <f>[1]</f> And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: <f>ⓥ</f>‘I AM has sent me to you.’”
3-15 God also said to Moses, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘The LORD, <f>[2]</f> the <f>ⓦ</f>God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is <f>ⓧ</f>my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.
3-16 Go and <f>ⓨ</f>gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, <f>ⓩ</f>“I have observed you and what has been done to you in Egypt,
3-17 and I promise that <f>ⓐ</f>I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, a land <f>ⓑ</f>flowing with milk and honey.”’
3-18 And <f>ⓒ</f>they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel <f>ⓓ</f>shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has <f>ⓔ</f>met with us; and now, please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’
3-19 But I know that the king of Egypt <f>ⓕ</f>will not let you go unless compelled <f>ⓖ</f>by a mighty hand. <f>[3]</f>
3-20 So <f>ⓗ</f>I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with <f>ⓘ</f>all the wonders that I will do in it; <f>ⓙ</f>after that he will let you go.
3-21 And <f>ⓚ</f>I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and when you go, you shall not go empty,
3-22 but each woman shall ask of her neighbor, and any woman who lives in her house, for <f>ⓛ</f>silver and gold jewelry, and for clothing. You shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. So <f>ⓜ</f>you shall plunder the Egyptians.”
5-1 <pb/>Now there arose <f>ⓐ</f>a great outcry of the people and of their wives <f>ⓑ</f>against their Jewish brothers.
5-2 For there were those who said, “With our sons and our daughters, we are many. So let us get grain, that we may eat and keep alive.”
5-3 There were also those who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get grain because of the famine.”
5-4 And there were those who said, “We have borrowed money for <f>ⓒ</f>the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards.
5-5 Now <f>ⓓ</f>our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children are as their children. Yet <f>ⓔ</f>we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but it is not in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our vineyards.”
5-6 <pb/>I was very angry when I heard <f>ⓕ</f>their outcry and these words.
5-7 I took counsel with myself, and I brought charges against the nobles and the officials. I said to them, <f>ⓖ</f>“You are exacting interest, each from his brother.” And I held a great assembly against them
5-8 and said to them, “We, as far as we are able, <f>ⓗ</f>have bought back our Jewish brothers who have been sold to the nations, but you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us!” They were silent and could not find a word to say.
5-9 So I said, “The thing that you are doing is not good. Ought you not to walk <f>ⓘ</f>in the fear of our God <f>ⓙ</f>to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies?
5-10 Moreover, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us abandon this exacting of interest.
5-11 Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and the percentage of money, grain, wine, and oil that you have been exacting from them.”
5-12 Then they said, “We will restore these and <f>ⓚ</f>require nothing from them. We will do as you say.” And I called the priests and <f>ⓛ</f>made them swear <f>ⓜ</f>to do as they had promised.
5-13 <f>ⓝ</f> I also shook out the fold <f>[1]</f> of my garment and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not keep this promise. So may he be shaken out and emptied.” <f>ⓞ</f>And all the assembly said “Amen” and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
5-14 <pb/>Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from <f>ⓟ</f>the twentieth year to <f>ⓠ</f>the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, <f>ⓡ</f>neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance of the governor.
5-15 The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people and took from them for their daily ration <f>[2]</f> forty shekels <f>[3]</f> of silver. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, <f>ⓢ</f>because of the fear of God.
5-16 I also persevered in the work on this wall, and we acquired no land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.
5-17 Moreover, there were <f>ⓣ</f>at my table 150 men, Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us.
5-18 <f>ⓤ</f> Now what was prepared at my expense <f>[4]</f> for each day was one ox and six choice sheep and birds, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. Yet for all this <f>ⓥ</f>I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the service was too heavy on this people.
5-19 <f>ⓦ</f> Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.
38-1 <pb/>Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, <f>ⓐ</f>Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and <f>ⓑ</f>Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people:
38-2 “Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓒ</f>He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, <f>ⓓ</f>but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live.
38-3 Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓔ</f>This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.”
38-4 Then the officials said to the king, <f>ⓕ</f>“Let this man be put to death, <f>ⓖ</f>for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking <f>ⓗ</f>the welfare of this people, but their harm.”
38-5 King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands, <f>ⓘ</f>for the king can do nothing against you.”
38-6 So they took Jeremiah <f>ⓙ</f>and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son, which was in <f>ⓚ</f>the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down <f>ⓛ</f>by ropes. <f>ⓜ</f>And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and <f>ⓝ</f>Jeremiah sank in the mud.
38-7 <pb/>When <f>ⓞ</f>Ebed-melech <f>ⓟ</f>the Ethiopian, <f>ⓠ</f>a eunuch who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern — the king was sitting <f>ⓡ</f>in the Benjamin Gate —
38-8 <f>ⓢ</f> Ebed-melech went from the king's house and said to the king,
38-9 “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of <f>ⓣ</f>hunger, <f>ⓤ</f>for there is no bread left in the city.”
38-10 Then the king commanded <f>ⓥ</f>Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, “Take thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”
38-11 So <f>ⓦ</f>Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern <f>ⓧ</f>by ropes.
38-12 Then <f>ⓨ</f>Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and <f>ⓩ</f>the ropes.” Jeremiah did so.
38-13 Then they drew Jeremiah up with <f>ⓐ</f>ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the <f>ⓑ</f>court of the guard.
38-14 <pb/>King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me.”
38-15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”
38-16 Then King Zedekiah swore <f>ⓒ</f>secretly to Jeremiah, <f>ⓓ</f>“As the LORD lives, <f>ⓔ</f>who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of <f>ⓕ</f>these men who seek your life.”
38-17 <pb/>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓖ</f>If you will surrender to <f>ⓗ</f>the officials of the king of Babylon, <f>ⓘ</f>then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.
38-18 But if you do not surrender to <f>ⓙ</f>the officials of the king of Babylon, <f>ⓚ</f>then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, <f>ⓛ</f>and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.”
38-19 King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans <f>ⓜ</f>who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me.”
38-20 Jeremiah said, “You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, <f>ⓝ</f>and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared.
38-21 But if you refuse to <f>ⓞ</f>surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me:
38-22 Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f>“‘Your trusted friends have deceived you </t><t>and prevailed against you; </t><t>now that your feet are sunk in the mud, </t><t>they turn away from you.’ </t>
38-23 <pb/>All your wives and <f>ⓠ</f>your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.”
38-24 <pb/>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die.
38-25 If <f>ⓡ</f>the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,’
38-26 then you shall say to them, <f>ⓢ</f>‘I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”
38-27 Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
38-28 And Jeremiah remained <f>ⓣ</f>in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
3-2 For <f>ⓑ</f>we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, <f>ⓒ</f>he is a perfect man, <f>ⓓ</f>able also to bridle his whole body.
3-3 If we put <f>ⓔ</f>bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.
3-4 Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
3-5 So also the tongue is a small member, yet <f>ⓕ</f>it boasts of great things. <pb/>How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
3-6 And <f>ⓖ</f>the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, <f>ⓗ</f>staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, <f>[1]</f> and set on fire by hell. <f>[2]</f>
3-7 For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
3-8 but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, <f>ⓘ</f>full of deadly poison.
3-9 With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people <f>ⓙ</f>who are made in the likeness of God.
3-10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, <f>[3]</f> these things ought not to be so.
3-11 Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water?
3-12 Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.
3-13 <pb/>Who is wise and understanding among you? <f>ⓚ</f>By his good conduct let him show his works <f>ⓛ</f>in the meekness of wisdom.
3-14 But if you have bitter <f>ⓜ</f>jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
3-15 This is not <f>ⓝ</f>the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, <f>ⓞ</f>demonic.
3-16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.
3-17 But <f>ⓟ</f>the wisdom from above is first pure, then <f>ⓠ</f>peaceable, gentle, open to reason, <f>ⓡ</f>full of mercy and good fruits, <f>ⓢ</f>impartial and <f>ⓣ</f>sincere.
3-18 And <f>ⓤ</f>a harvest of righteousness <f>ⓥ</f>is sown in peace by those who make peace.
