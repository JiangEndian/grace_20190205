15-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
15-2 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, <f>ⓐ</f>When any man has a discharge from his body, <f>[1]</f> his discharge is unclean.
15-3 And this is the law of his uncleanness for a discharge: whether his body runs with his discharge, or his body is blocked up by his discharge, it is his uncleanness.
15-4 Every bed on which the one with the discharge lies shall be unclean, and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.
15-5 And anyone who touches his bed <f>ⓑ</f>shall wash his clothes and <f>ⓒ</f>bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-6 And whoever sits on anything on which the one with the discharge has sat shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-7 And whoever touches the body of the one with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-8 And if the one with the discharge spits on someone who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-9 And any saddle on which the one with the discharge rides shall be unclean.
15-10 And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening. And whoever carries such things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-11 Anyone whom the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-12 And an <f>ⓓ</f>earthenware vessel that the one with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
15-13 <pb/>“And when the one with a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then <f>ⓔ</f>he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes. And he shall bathe his body in fresh water and shall be clean.
15-14 And on the eighth day he shall take two <f>ⓕ</f>turtledoves or two pigeons and come before the LORD to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.
15-15 And the priest shall use them, <f>ⓖ</f>one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. <f>ⓗ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD for his discharge.
15-16 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> “If a man has an emission of semen, he shall bathe his whole body in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-17 And every garment and every skin on which the semen comes shall be washed with water and be unclean until the evening.
15-18 If a man lies with a woman and has an emission of semen, both of them shall bathe themselves in water and <f>ⓙ</f>be unclean until the evening.
15-19 <pb/>“When a woman has a discharge, and the discharge in her body is blood, she shall be in her menstrual impurity for seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.
15-20 <f>ⓚ</f> And everything on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean. Everything also on which she sits shall be unclean.
15-21 And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-22 And whoever touches anything on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-23 Whether it is the bed or anything on which she sits, when he touches it he shall be unclean until the evening.
15-24 And <f>ⓛ</f>if any man lies with her and her menstrual impurity comes upon him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
15-25 <pb/>“If <f>ⓜ</f>a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, all the days of the discharge she shall continue in uncleanness. As in the days of her impurity, she shall be unclean.
15-26 Every bed on which she lies, all the days of her discharge, shall be to her as the bed of her impurity. And everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her menstrual impurity.
15-27 And whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
15-28 But <f>ⓝ</f>if she is cleansed of her discharge, she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
15-29 And on the eighth day she shall take two <f>ⓞ</f>turtledoves or two pigeons and bring them to the priest, to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
15-30 And the priest shall use one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. And the priest shall make atonement for her before the LORD for her unclean discharge.
15-31 <pb/>“Thus you shall keep the people of Israel separate from their uncleanness, lest they die in their uncleanness by <f>ⓟ</f>defiling my tabernacle that is in their midst.”
15-32 <pb/>This is the law <f>ⓠ</f>for him who has a discharge and <f>ⓡ</f>for him who has an emission of semen, becoming unclean thereby;
15-33 <f>ⓢ</f> also for her who is unwell with her menstrual impurity, that is, for anyone, <f>ⓣ</f>male or <f>ⓤ</f>female, who has a discharge, and for the <f>ⓥ</f>man who lies with a woman who is unclean.
34-1 <pb/>Then Elihu answered and said:
34-2 <pb/><t>“Hear my words, you wise men, </t><t>and give ear to me, you who know;</t>
34-3 <t>for <f>ⓐ</f>the ear tests words </t><t>as the palate tastes food.</t>
34-4 <t>Let us choose <f>ⓑ</f>what is right; </t><t>let us know among ourselves what is good.</t>
34-5 <t>For Job has said, ‘I am <f>ⓒ</f>in the right, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>God has taken away my right;</t>
34-6 <t>in spite of my right I am counted a liar; </t><t>my wound is incurable, though I am <f>ⓔ</f>without transgression.’</t>
34-7 <t>What man is like Job, </t><t>who <f>ⓕ</f>drinks up scoffing like water,</t>
34-8 <t>who travels in company with evildoers </t><t>and walks <f>ⓖ</f>with wicked men?</t>
34-9 <t>For <f>ⓗ</f>he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing </t><t>that he should take delight in God.’ </t>
34-10 <pb/><t>“Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding: </t><t>far be it from God that he should <f>ⓘ</f>do wickedness, </t><t>and from the Almighty that he should do wrong.</t>
34-11 <t>For according to <f>ⓙ</f>the work of a man he will repay him, </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>according to his ways he will make it befall him.</t>
34-12 <t>Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>the Almighty will not pervert justice.</t>
34-13 <t>Who gave him charge over the earth, </t><t>and who <f>ⓜ</f>laid on him <f>[1]</f> the whole world?</t>
34-14 <t>If he should <f>ⓝ</f>set his heart to it </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>gather to himself his <f>ⓟ</f>spirit and his breath,</t>
34-15 <t>all flesh would perish together, </t><t>and man would <f>ⓠ</f>return to dust. </t>
34-16 <pb/><t>“If you have understanding, hear this; </t><t>listen to what I say.</t>
34-17 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Shall one who hates justice govern? </t><t>Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,</t>
34-18 <t>who <f>ⓢ</f>says to a king, ‘Worthless one,’ </t><t>and to nobles, ‘Wicked man,’</t>
34-19 <t>who <f>ⓣ</f>shows no partiality to princes, </t><t>nor regards the rich <f>ⓤ</f>more than the poor, </t><t>for <f>ⓥ</f>they are all the work of his hands?</t>
34-20 <t>In a moment <f>ⓦ</f>they die; </t><t>at <f>ⓧ</f>midnight the people are shaken and pass away, </t><t>and the mighty are taken away by <f>ⓨ</f>no human hand. </t>
34-21 <pb/><t>“For his eyes are on <f>ⓩ</f>the ways of a man, </t><t>and he sees all his <f>ⓐ</f>steps.</t>
34-22 <t>There is no <f>ⓑ</f>gloom or <f>ⓒ</f>deep darkness </t><t>where evildoers may hide themselves.</t>
34-23 <t>For God <f>[2]</f> has no need to consider a man further, </t><t>that he should go before God in <f>ⓓ</f>judgment.</t>
34-24 <t>He <f>ⓔ</f>shatters the mighty without investigation </t><t>and sets <f>ⓕ</f>others in their place.</t>
34-25 <t>Thus, knowing their works, </t><t>he <f>ⓖ</f>overturns them in the night, and they are crushed.</t>
34-26 <t>He strikes them for their wickedness </t><t>in a place for all to see,</t>
34-27 <t>because they turned aside from <f>ⓗ</f>following him </t><t>and had no regard for any of his ways,</t>
34-28 <t>so that they <f>ⓘ</f>caused the cry of the poor to come to him, </t><t>and he <f>ⓙ</f>heard the cry of the afflicted — </t>
34-29 <t>When he is quiet, who can condemn? </t><t>When he hides his face, who can behold him, </t><t>whether it be a nation or a man? — </t>
34-30 <t>that a godless man should not reign, </t><t>that he should not ensnare the people. </t>
34-31 <pb/><t>“For has anyone said to God, </t><t>‘I have borne punishment; I will not offend any more;</t>
34-32 <t><f>ⓚ</f> teach me what I do not see; </t><t>if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?</t>
34-33 <t>Will he then make repayment to suit you, </t><t>because you reject it? </t><t>For you must choose, and not I; </t><t>therefore <f>ⓛ</f>declare what you know. <f>[3]</f></t>
34-34 <t>Men of understanding will say to me, </t><t>and the wise man who hears me will say:</t>
34-35 <t>‘Job <f>ⓜ</f>speaks without knowledge; </t><t>his words are without insight.’</t>
34-36 <t>Would that Job were tried to the end, </t><t>because he answers like wicked men.</t>
34-37 <t>For he adds rebellion to his sin; </t><t>he <f>ⓝ</f>claps his hands among us </t><t>and multiplies his words against God.” </t>
33-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
33-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, speak to <f>ⓑ</f>your people and say to them, If <f>ⓒ</f>I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their <f>ⓓ</f>watchman,
33-3 and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and <f>ⓔ</f>blows the trumpet and warns the people,
33-4 then if anyone who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, <f>ⓕ</f>his blood shall be upon his own head.
33-5 <f>ⓖ</f> He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life.
33-6 <f>ⓗ</f> But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any one of them, <f>ⓘ</f>that person is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand.
33-7 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> “So you, <f>ⓚ</f>son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel. <f>ⓛ</f>Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.
33-8 <f>ⓜ</f> If I say to the wicked, O wicked one, you shall surely die, <f>ⓝ</f>and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, <f>ⓞ</f>that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
33-9 <f>ⓟ</f> But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, <f>ⓠ</f>that person shall die in his iniquity, <f>ⓡ</f>but you will have delivered your soul.
33-10 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓢ</f>son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you said: ‘Surely our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and <f>ⓣ</f>we rot away because of them. <f>ⓤ</f>How then can we live?’
33-11 Say to them, <f>ⓥ</f>As I live, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓦ</f>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; <f>ⓧ</f>turn back, turn back from your evil ways, <f>ⓨ</f>for why will you die, O house of Israel?
33-12 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> “And you, son of man, say to <f>ⓐ</f>your people, <f>ⓑ</f>The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses, <f>ⓒ</f>and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness, <f>ⓓ</f>and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness <f>[1]</f> when he sins.
33-13 Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, yet <f>ⓔ</f>if he trusts in his righteousness and does injustice, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered, but in his injustice that he has done he shall die.
33-14 Again, <f>ⓕ</f>though I say to the wicked, <f>ⓖ</f>‘You shall surely die,’ yet <f>ⓗ</f>if he turns from his sin and does what is just and right,
33-15 if the wicked <f>ⓘ</f>restores the pledge, <f>ⓙ</f>gives back what he has taken by robbery, and walks <f>ⓚ</f>in the statutes of life, not doing injustice, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
33-16 <f>ⓛ</f> None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him. He has done what is just and right; he shall surely live.
33-17 <pb/>“Yet <f>ⓜ</f>your people say, <f>ⓝ</f>‘The way of the Lord is not just,’ when it is their own way that is not just.
33-18 <f>ⓞ</f> When the righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it.
33-19 And <f>ⓟ</f>when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he shall live by this.
33-20 Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ O house of Israel, <f>ⓠ</f>I will judge each of you according to his ways.”
33-21 <pb/>In the <f>ⓡ</f>twelfth year <f>ⓢ</f>of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, <f>ⓣ</f>a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me and said, <f>ⓤ</f>“The city has been struck down.”
33-22 <f>ⓥ</f> Now <f>ⓦ</f>the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came; and he had opened my mouth by the time the man came to me in the morning, so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.
33-23 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
33-24 <f>ⓧ</f> “Son of man, the inhabitants of these <f>ⓨ</f>waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, <f>ⓩ</f>‘Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but <f>ⓐ</f>we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.’
33-25 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓑ</f>You eat flesh with the blood and <f>ⓒ</f>lift up your eyes to your idols and <f>ⓓ</f>shed blood; shall you then possess the land?
33-26 <f>ⓔ</f> You rely on the sword, <f>ⓕ</f>you commit abominations, and <f>ⓖ</f>each of you defiles his neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land?
33-27 Say this to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓗ</f>As I live, surely those who are in <f>ⓘ</f>the waste places shall fall by <f>ⓙ</f>the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to <f>ⓚ</f>the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in <f>ⓛ</f>strongholds and in caves shall die by <f>ⓜ</f>pestilence.
33-28 <f>ⓝ</f> And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and <f>ⓞ</f>her proud might shall come to an end, and <f>ⓟ</f>the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that none will pass through.
33-29 <f>ⓠ</f> Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed.
33-30 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓡ</f>son of man, <f>ⓢ</f>your people who talk together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to his brother, ‘Come, and hear what the word is that comes from the LORD.’
33-31 <f>ⓣ</f> And they come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear what you say but they will not do it; for <f>ⓤ</f>with lustful talk in their mouths they act; their heart is set on their gain.
33-32 And behold, you are to them like one who sings lustful songs with a beautiful voice and <f>ⓥ</f>plays <f>[2]</f> well on an instrument, for <f>ⓦ</f>they hear what you say, but they will not do it.
33-33 <f>ⓧ</f> When this comes — and come it will! — <f>ⓨ</f>then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
