Joshua 11-1 <pb/>When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard of this, he <f>ⓐ</f>sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
Joshua 11-2 and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the <f>ⓑ</f>Arabah south of <f>ⓒ</f>Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and <f>ⓓ</f>in Naphoth-dor on the <f>ⓔ</f>west,
Joshua 11-3 to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the <f>ⓕ</f>Jebusites in the hill country, and the <f>ⓖ</f>Hivites under <f>ⓗ</f>Hermon in the land of <f>ⓘ</f>Mizpah.
Joshua 11-4 And they came out with all their troops, a great horde, in number <f>ⓙ</f>like the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.
Joshua 11-5 And all these kings joined their forces and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
Joshua 11-6 <pb/>And the LORD said to Joshua, <f>ⓚ</f>“Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give over all of them, slain, to Israel. You shall <f>ⓛ</f>hamstring their horses and burn their <f>ⓜ</f>chariots with fire.”
Joshua 11-7 So Joshua and all his warriors came <f>ⓝ</f>suddenly against them by the waters of Merom and fell upon them.
Joshua 11-8 And the LORD gave them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and chased them as far as <f>ⓞ</f>Great Sidon and <f>ⓟ</f>Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of <f>ⓠ</f>Mizpeh. And they struck them until he left none remaining.
Joshua 11-9 And Joshua did to them <f>ⓡ</f>just as the LORD said to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua 11-10 <pb/>And Joshua turned back at that time and captured <f>ⓢ</f>Hazor and struck its king with the sword, for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms.
Joshua 11-11 And they struck with the sword all who were in it, devoting them to destruction; <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓣ</f>there was none left that breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire.
Joshua 11-12 And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua captured, and struck them with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction, <f>ⓤ</f>just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.
Joshua 11-13 But none of the cities that stood on mounds did Israel burn, except Hazor alone; that Joshua burned.
Joshua 11-14 And all the spoil of these cities and the livestock, the people of Israel took for their plunder. But every person they struck with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they did not leave any who breathed.
Joshua 11-15 <f>ⓥ</f> Just as the LORD had commanded Moses his servant, <f>ⓦ</f>so Moses commanded Joshua, <f>ⓧ</f>and so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
Joshua 11-16 <pb/>So Joshua took all that land, <f>ⓨ</f>the hill country and all the Negeb and <f>ⓩ</f>all the land of Goshen <f>ⓐ</f>and the lowland <f>ⓑ</f>and the Arabah <f>ⓒ</f>and the hill country of Israel and its lowland
Joshua 11-17 <f>ⓓ</f> from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as <f>ⓔ</f>Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below <f>ⓕ</f>Mount Hermon. And he captured <f>ⓖ</f>all their kings and struck them and put them to death.
Joshua 11-18 Joshua made war <f>ⓗ</f>a long time with all those kings.
Joshua 11-19 There was not a city that made peace with the people of Israel except <f>ⓘ</f>the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took them all in battle.
Joshua 11-20 For it was the LORD's doing <f>ⓙ</f>to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed, <f>ⓚ</f>just as the LORD commanded Moses.
Joshua 11-21 <pb/>And Joshua came at that time and cut off <f>ⓛ</f>the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction with their cities.
Joshua 11-22 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the people of Israel. Only in Gaza, <f>ⓜ</f>in Gath, and in Ashdod did some remain.
Joshua 11-23 So Joshua took the whole land, <f>ⓝ</f>according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses. <f>ⓞ</f>And Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel <f>ⓟ</f>according to their tribal allotments. And the land had rest from war.

Malachi 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “Behold, I send <f>ⓑ</f>my messenger, and <f>ⓒ</f>he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord <f>ⓓ</f>whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and <f>ⓔ</f>the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 3-2 But <f>ⓕ</f>who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For <f>ⓖ</f>he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap.
Malachi 3-3 He will sit <f>ⓗ</f>as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring <f>ⓘ</f>offerings in righteousness to the LORD. <f>[1]</f>
Malachi 3-4 <f>ⓙ</f> Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.
Malachi 3-5 <pb/>“Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be <f>ⓚ</f>a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those <f>ⓛ</f>who oppress the hired worker in his wages, <f>ⓜ</f>the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 3-6 <pb/>“For <f>ⓝ</f>I the LORD do not change; <f>ⓞ</f>therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.
Malachi 3-7 <f>ⓟ</f> From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. <f>ⓠ</f>Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. <f>ⓡ</f>But you say, ‘How shall we return?’
Malachi 3-8 Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. <f>ⓢ</f>But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ <f>ⓣ</f>In your tithes and contributions.
Malachi 3-9 <f>ⓤ</f> You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you.
Malachi 3-10 <f>ⓥ</f> Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby <f>ⓦ</f>put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open <f>ⓧ</f>the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.
Malachi 3-11 I will rebuke <f>ⓨ</f>the devourer <f>[2]</f> for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 3-12 Then <f>ⓩ</f>all nations will call you blessed, for you will be <f>ⓐ</f>a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 3-13 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> “Your words have been hard against me, says the LORD. <f>ⓒ</f>But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’

Malachi 3-16 <pb/>Then those who feared the LORD <f>ⓘ</f>spoke with one another. The LORD paid attention and heard them, and <f>ⓙ</f>a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the LORD and esteemed his name.
Malachi 3-17 “They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓚ</f>in the day when I make up <f>ⓛ</f>my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.
Malachi 3-18 Then once more you shall <f>ⓜ</f>see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.
