28-1 <pb/>In those days <f>ⓐ</f>the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, “Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army.”
28-2 David said to Achish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.” And Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
28-3 <pb/>Now <f>ⓑ</f>Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him <f>ⓒ</f>in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put <f>ⓓ</f>the mediums and the necromancers out of the land.
28-4 The Philistines assembled and came and encamped <f>ⓔ</f>at Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped <f>ⓕ</f>at Gilboa.
28-5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
28-6 And when Saul inquired of the LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>the LORD did not answer him, either <f>ⓗ</f>by dreams, or <f>ⓘ</f>by Urim, or by prophets.
28-7 Then Saul said to his servants, <f>ⓙ</f>“Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him, “Behold, there is a medium at <f>ⓚ</f>En-dor.”
28-8 <pb/>So Saul <f>ⓛ</f>disguised himself and put on other garments and went, he and two men with him. And they came to the woman by night. And he said, <f>ⓜ</f>“Divine for me by a spirit and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you.”
28-9 The woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done, <f>ⓝ</f>how he has cut off the mediums and the necromancers from the land. Why then are you laying a trap for my life to bring about my death?”
28-10 But Saul swore to her by the LORD, <f>ⓞ</f>“As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”
28-11 Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”
28-12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul.”
28-13 The king said to her, “Do not be afraid. What do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”
28-14 He said to her, “What is his appearance?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped <f>ⓟ</f>in a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.
28-15 <pb/>Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and <f>ⓠ</f>God has turned away from me and <f>ⓡ</f>answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do.”
28-16 And Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has turned from you and become your enemy?
28-17 The LORD has done to you as he spoke by me, for <f>ⓢ</f>the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.
28-18 <f>ⓣ</f> Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day.
28-19 Moreover, the LORD will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you <f>ⓤ</f>and your sons shall be with me. The LORD will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.”
28-20 <pb/>Then Saul fell at once full length on the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
28-21 And the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, “Behold, your servant has obeyed you. <f>ⓥ</f>I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to what you have said to me.
28-22 Now therefore, you also obey your servant. Let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.”
28-23 He refused and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he listened to their words. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.
28-24 Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it,
28-25 and she put it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.
1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
1-2 <pb/><t>To know wisdom and instruction, </t><t>to understand words of insight,</t>
1-3 <t>to receive instruction in wise dealing, </t><t>in <f>ⓑ</f>righteousness, justice, and equity;</t>
1-4 <t>to give prudence to <f>ⓒ</f>the simple, </t><t>knowledge and <f>ⓓ</f>discretion to the youth — </t>
1-5 <t>Let the wise hear and <f>ⓔ</f>increase in learning, </t><t>and the one who understands obtain guidance,</t>
1-6 <t>to understand a proverb and a saying, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the words of the wise and their <f>ⓖ</f>riddles. </t>
1-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; </t><t>fools despise wisdom and instruction. </t>
1-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Hear, my son, your father's instruction, </t><t>and forsake not your mother's teaching,</t>
1-9 <t>for they are <f>ⓙ</f>a graceful garland for your head </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>pendants for your neck.</t>
1-10 <t>My son, if sinners <f>ⓛ</f>entice you, </t><t>do not consent.</t>
1-11 <t>If they say, “Come with us, <f>ⓜ</f>let us lie in wait for blood; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>let us ambush the innocent without reason;</t>
1-12 <t>like Sheol let us <f>ⓞ</f>swallow them alive, </t><t>and whole, like <f>ⓟ</f>those who go down to the pit;</t>
1-13 <t>we shall find all precious goods, </t><t>we shall fill our houses with plunder;</t>
1-14 <t>throw in your lot among us; </t><t>we will all have one purse” — </t>
1-15 <t>my son, <f>ⓠ</f>do not walk in the way with them; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>hold back your foot from their paths,</t>
1-16 <t>for <f>ⓢ</f>their feet run to evil, </t><t>and they make haste to shed blood.</t>
1-17 <t><f>ⓣ</f> For in vain is a net spread </t><t>in the sight of any bird,</t>
1-18 <t>but these men <f>ⓤ</f>lie in wait for their own blood; </t><t>they <f>ⓥ</f>set an ambush for their own lives.</t>
1-19 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Such are the ways of everyone who is <f>ⓧ</f>greedy for unjust gain; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>it takes away the life of its possessors. </t>
1-20 <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f> Wisdom cries aloud in the street, </t><t>in the markets she raises her voice;</t>
1-21 <t>at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; </t><t>at <f>ⓐ</f>the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</t>
1-22 <t>“How long, O <f>ⓑ</f>simple ones, will you love being simple? </t><t>How long will <f>ⓒ</f>scoffers delight in their scoffing </t><t>and fools <f>ⓓ</f>hate knowledge?</t>
1-23 <t>If you turn at my reproof, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>behold, I will <f>ⓔ</f>pour out my spirit to you; </t><t>I will make my words known to you.</t>
1-24 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Because I have called and <f>ⓖ</f>you refused to listen, </t><t>have <f>ⓗ</f>stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</t>
1-25 <t>because you have <f>ⓘ</f>ignored all my counsel </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>would have none of my reproof,</t>
1-26 <t>I also <f>ⓚ</f>will laugh at your calamity; </t><t>I will mock when <f>ⓛ</f>terror strikes you,</t>
1-27 <t>when terror strikes you like <f>ⓜ</f>a storm </t><t>and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, </t><t>when distress and anguish come upon you.</t>
1-28 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; </t><t>they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</t>
1-29 <t>Because they <f>ⓞ</f>hated knowledge </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>did not choose the fear of the LORD,</t>
1-30 <t><f>ⓠ</f> would have none of my counsel </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>despised all my reproof,</t>
1-31 <t>therefore they shall eat <f>ⓢ</f>the fruit of their way, </t><t>and have <f>ⓣ</f>their fill of their own devices.</t>
1-32 <t>For the simple are killed by <f>ⓤ</f>their turning away, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>the complacency of fools destroys them;</t>
1-33 <t>but <f>ⓦ</f>whoever listens to me will dwell secure </t><t>and will be <f>ⓧ</f>at ease, without dread of disaster.” </t>
21-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Jesus <f>[1]</f> looked up and saw the rich <f>ⓑ</f>putting their gifts into <f>ⓒ</f>the offering box,
21-2 and he saw a poor widow put in two <f>ⓓ</f>small copper coins. <f>[2]</f>
21-3 And he said, <J>“Truly, I tell you, <f>ⓔ</f>this poor widow has put in more than all of them.</J>
21-4 <J>For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her <f>ⓕ</f>poverty put in all <f>ⓖ</f>she had to live on.”</J>
21-5 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, he said,
21-6 <J>“As for these things that you see, <f>ⓘ</f>the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”</J>
21-7 And they asked him, “Teacher, <f>ⓙ</f>when will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?”
21-8 And he said, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“See that you are not led astray. For <f>ⓛ</f>many will come in my name, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>‘I am he!’ and, <f>ⓝ</f>‘The time is at hand!’ Do not go after them.</J>
21-9 <J>And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be <f>ⓞ</f>terrified, for these things <f>ⓟ</f>must first take place, but the end will not be at once.”</J>
21-10 <pb/>Then he said to them, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“Nation will rise against nation, and <f>ⓡ</f>kingdom against kingdom.</J>
21-11 <J>There will be great <f>ⓢ</f>earthquakes, and in various places <f>ⓣ</f>famines and pestilences. And there will be <f>ⓤ</f>terrors and great <f>ⓥ</f>signs from heaven.</J>
21-12 <J>But before all this <f>ⓦ</f>they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to <f>ⓧ</f>the synagogues and <f>ⓨ</f>prisons, and you <f>ⓩ</f>will be brought before <f>ⓐ</f>kings and <f>ⓑ</f>governors for my name's sake.</J>
21-13 <J><f>ⓒ</f> This will be your opportunity to bear witness.</J>
21-14 <J>Settle it therefore in your minds <f>ⓓ</f>not to meditate beforehand how to answer,</J>
21-15 <J>for <f>ⓔ</f>I will give you a mouth and <f>ⓕ</f>wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or <f>ⓖ</f>contradict.</J>
21-16 <J>You will be delivered up <f>ⓗ</f>even by parents and brothers <f>[3]</f> and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death.</J>
21-17 <J><f>ⓘ</f> You will be hated by all for my name's sake.</J>
21-18 <J>But <f>ⓙ</f>not a hair of your head will perish.</J>
21-19 <J>By your <f>ⓚ</f>endurance you will gain your lives.</J>
21-20 <pb/><J>“But <f>ⓛ</f>when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that <f>ⓜ</f>its desolation has come near.</J>
21-21 <J>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it,</J>
21-22 <J>for these are <f>ⓝ</f>days of <f>ⓞ</f>vengeance, to fulfill <f>ⓟ</f>all that is written.</J>
21-23 <J><f>ⓠ</f> Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and <f>ⓡ</f>wrath against this people.</J>
21-24 <J>They will fall by the edge of the sword and <f>ⓢ</f>be led captive among all nations, and <f>ⓣ</f>Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, <f>ⓤ</f>until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</J>
21-25 <pb/><J>“And <f>ⓥ</f>there will be signs in sun and moon <f>ⓦ</f>and stars, and on the earth <f>ⓧ</f>distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves,</J>
21-26 <J>people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For <f>ⓨ</f>the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</J>
21-27 <J>And then they will see <f>ⓩ</f>the Son of Man coming in a cloud <f>ⓐ</f>with power and great glory.</J>
21-28 <J>Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and <f>ⓑ</f>raise your heads, because <f>ⓒ</f>your redemption is drawing near.”</J>
21-29 <pb/>And he told them a parable: <J>“Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</J>
21-30 <J>As soon as they come out in leaf, you see <f>ⓓ</f>for yourselves and know that the summer is already near.</J>
21-31 <J>So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.</J>
21-32 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place.</J>
21-33 <J><f>ⓕ</f> Heaven and earth will pass away, but <f>ⓖ</f>my words will not pass away.</J>
21-34 <pb/><J>“But watch yourselves <f>ⓗ</f>lest <f>ⓘ</f>your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and <f>ⓙ</f>cares of this life, and <f>ⓚ</f>that day come upon you suddenly <f>ⓛ</f>like a trap.</J>
21-35 <J>For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</J>
21-36 <J>But <f>ⓜ</f>stay awake at all times, <f>ⓝ</f>praying that you may <f>ⓞ</f>have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and <f>ⓟ</f>to stand before the Son of Man.”</J>
21-37 <pb/>And <f>ⓠ</f>every day he was teaching in the temple, but <f>ⓡ</f>at night he went out and lodged on <f>ⓢ</f>the mount called Olivet.
21-38 And early in the morning <f>ⓣ</f>all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.
