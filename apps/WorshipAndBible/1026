8-1 <pb/>When Samuel became old, <f>ⓐ</f>he made his sons judges over Israel.
8-2 The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba.
8-3 Yet his sons did not walk in his ways <f>ⓑ</f>but turned aside after gain. <f>ⓒ</f>They took bribes and perverted justice.
8-4 <pb/>Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at <f>ⓓ</f>Ramah
8-5 and said to him, “Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways. <f>ⓔ</f>Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.”
8-6 But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the LORD.
8-7 And the LORD said to Samuel, “Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, <f>ⓕ</f>for they have not rejected you, <f>ⓖ</f>but they have rejected me from being king over them.
8-8 According to all the deeds that they have done, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you.
8-9 Now then, obey their voice; only you shall solemnly warn them <f>ⓗ</f>and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.”
8-10 <pb/>So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking for a king from him.
8-11 He said, <f>ⓘ</f>“These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: <f>ⓙ</f>he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots.
8-12 And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some <f>ⓚ</f>to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.
8-13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
8-14 <f>ⓛ</f> He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.
8-15 He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.
8-16 He will take your male servants and female servants and the best of your young men <f>[1]</f> and your donkeys, and put them to his work.
8-17 He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.
8-18 And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, <f>ⓜ</f>but the LORD will not answer you in that day.”
8-19 <pb/>But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel. And they said, “No! But there shall be a king over us,
8-20 <f>ⓝ</f> that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”
8-21 And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.
8-22 And the LORD said to Samuel, <f>ⓞ</f>“Obey their voice and make them a king.” Samuel then said to the men of Israel, “Go every man to his city.”
131-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> O LORD, my heart is not <f>ⓑ</f>lifted up; </t><t>my eyes are not <f>ⓒ</f>raised too high; </t><t>I do not <f>ⓓ</f>occupy myself with things </t><t>too great and <f>ⓔ</f>too marvelous for me.</t>
131-2 <t>But I have calmed and quieted my soul, </t><t>like a weaned <f>ⓕ</f>child with its mother; </t><t>like a weaned child is my soul within me. </t>
131-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> O Israel, hope in the LORD </t><t>from this time forth and forevermore. </t>
1-1 <pb/>Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that <f>ⓐ</f>have been accomplished among us,
1-2 <f>ⓑ</f> just as those who <f>ⓒ</f>from the beginning were <f>ⓓ</f>eyewitnesses and <f>ⓔ</f>ministers of <f>ⓕ</f>the word <f>ⓖ</f>have delivered them to us,
1-3 it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write <f>ⓗ</f>an orderly account for you, <f>ⓘ</f>most excellent <f>ⓙ</f>Theophilus,
1-4 that you may have <f>ⓚ</f>certainty concerning the things <f>ⓛ</f>you have been taught.
1-5 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>of <f>ⓞ</f>the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
1-6 And they were both <f>ⓟ</f>righteous before God, walking <f>ⓠ</f>blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.
1-7 But they had no child, because <f>ⓡ</f>Elizabeth was barren, and <f>ⓢ</f>both were advanced in years.
1-8 <pb/>Now <f>ⓣ</f>while he was serving as priest before God when <f>ⓤ</f>his division was on duty,
1-9 according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot <f>ⓥ</f>to enter <f>ⓦ</f>the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
1-10 And the whole multitude of the people <f>ⓧ</f>were praying <f>ⓨ</f>outside at the hour of incense.
1-11 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of <f>ⓩ</f>the altar of incense.
1-12 And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and <f>ⓐ</f>fear fell upon him.
1-13 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for <f>ⓑ</f>your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and <f>ⓒ</f>you shall call his name John.
1-14 And you will have joy and gladness, and many will <f>ⓓ</f>rejoice at his birth,
1-15 for he will be <f>ⓔ</f>great before the Lord. And <f>ⓕ</f>he must not drink wine or strong <f>ⓖ</f>drink, and <f>ⓗ</f>he will be <f>ⓘ</f>filled with the Holy Spirit, <f>ⓙ</f>even from his mother's womb.
1-16 And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,
1-17 and <f>ⓚ</f>he will go before him <f>ⓛ</f>in the spirit and power of Elijah, <f>ⓜ</f>to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and <f>ⓝ</f>the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, <f>ⓞ</f>to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.”
1-18 <pb/>And Zechariah said to the angel, <f>ⓟ</f>“How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.”
1-19 And the angel answered him, “I am <f>ⓠ</f>Gabriel. <f>ⓡ</f>I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
1-20 And behold, <f>ⓢ</f>you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”
1-21 And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in <f>ⓣ</f>the temple.
1-22 And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in <f>ⓤ</f>the temple. And <f>ⓥ</f>he kept making signs to them and remained mute.
1-23 And <f>ⓦ</f>when his time of <f>ⓧ</f>service was ended, he went to his home.
1-24 <pb/>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,
1-25 “Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, <f>ⓨ</f>to take away my reproach among people.”
1-26 <pb/>In the sixth month the angel <f>ⓩ</f>Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named <f>ⓐ</f>Nazareth,
1-27 <f>ⓑ</f> to a virgin betrothed <f>[2]</f> to a man whose name was Joseph, <f>ⓒ</f>of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary.
1-28 And he came to her and said, “Greetings, <f>ⓓ</f>O favored one, <f>ⓔ</f>the Lord is with you!” <f>[3]</f>
1-29 But <f>ⓕ</f>she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.
1-30 And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for <f>ⓖ</f>you have found favor with God.
1-31 And behold, <f>ⓗ</f>you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and <f>ⓘ</f>you shall call his name Jesus.
1-32 He will be great and will be called the Son of <f>ⓙ</f>the Most High. And the Lord God <f>ⓚ</f>will give to him the throne of <f>ⓛ</f>his father David,
1-33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob <f>ⓜ</f>forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”
1-34 <pb/>And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?” <f>[4]</f>
1-35 <pb/>And the angel answered her, <f>ⓝ</f>“The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of <f>ⓞ</f>the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born <f>[5]</f> will be called <f>ⓟ</f>holy — <f>ⓠ</f>the Son of God.
1-36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her <f>ⓡ</f>who was called barren.
1-37 For <f>ⓢ</f>nothing will be impossible with God.”
1-38 And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant <f>[6]</f> of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And <f>ⓣ</f>the angel departed from her.
1-39 <pb/>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into <f>ⓤ</f>the hill country, to a town in Judah,
1-40 and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
1-41 And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth <f>ⓥ</f>was filled with the Holy Spirit,
1-42 and she exclaimed with a loud cry, <f>ⓦ</f>“Blessed are you among women, and <f>ⓧ</f>blessed is <f>ⓨ</f>the fruit of your womb!
1-43 And why is this granted to me that the mother of <f>ⓩ</f>my Lord should come to me?
1-44 For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
1-45 And <f>ⓐ</f>blessed is she who believed that there would be <f>[7]</f> a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”
1-46 <pb/>And Mary said, <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f>“My <f>ⓒ</f>soul <f>ⓓ</f>magnifies the Lord,</t>
1-47 <t><f>ⓔ</f> and my <f>ⓕ</f>spirit rejoices in <f>ⓖ</f>God my Savior,</t>
1-48 <t>for <f>ⓗ</f>he has looked on the humble estate of his servant. </t><t>For behold, from now on all generations <f>ⓘ</f>will call me blessed;</t>
1-49 <t>for <f>ⓙ</f>he who is mighty <f>ⓚ</f>has done great things for me, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>holy is his name.</t>
1-50 <t>And <f>ⓜ</f>his mercy is for those who fear him </t><t>from generation to generation.</t>
1-51 <t><f>ⓝ</f> He has shown strength with his arm; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts;</t>
1-52 <t><f>ⓟ</f> he has brought down the mighty from their thrones </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and exalted those of humble estate;</t>
1-53 <t>he has filled <f>ⓡ</f>the hungry with good things, </t><t>and the rich <f>ⓢ</f>he has sent away empty.</t>
1-54 <t>He has <f>ⓣ</f>helped <f>ⓤ</f>his servant Israel, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>in remembrance of his mercy,</t>
1-55 <t><f>ⓦ</f> as he spoke to our fathers, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>to Abraham and to his offspring forever.” </t>
1-56 <pb/>And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.
1-57 <pb/>Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
1-58 And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord <f>ⓨ</f>had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
1-59 And <f>ⓩ</f>on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father,
1-60 but his mother answered, “No; <f>ⓐ</f>he shall be called John.”
1-61 And they said to her, “None of your relatives is called by this name.”
1-62 And <f>ⓑ</f>they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called.
1-63 And he asked for <f>ⓒ</f>a writing tablet and wrote, <f>ⓓ</f>“His name is John.” And they all wondered.
1-64 <f>ⓔ</f> And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue <f>ⓕ</f>loosed, and he spoke, <f>ⓖ</f>blessing God.
1-65 And <f>ⓗ</f>fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all <f>ⓘ</f>the hill country of Judea,
1-66 and all who heard them <f>ⓙ</f>laid them up in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For <f>ⓚ</f>the hand of the Lord was with him.
1-67 <pb/>And his father Zechariah <f>ⓛ</f>was filled with the Holy Spirit and <f>ⓜ</f>prophesied, saying,
1-68 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> “Blessed be the Lord <f>ⓞ</f>God of Israel, </t><t>for he has <f>ⓟ</f>visited and <f>ⓠ</f>redeemed his people</t>
1-69 <t>and <f>ⓡ</f>has raised up <f>ⓢ</f>a horn of salvation for us </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>in the house of his servant David,</t>
1-70 <t><f>ⓤ</f> as <f>ⓥ</f>he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,</t>
1-71 <t><f>ⓦ</f> that we should be saved from our enemies </t><t>and from the hand of all who hate us;</t>
1-72 <t><f>ⓧ</f> to show the mercy promised to our fathers </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>to remember his holy <f>ⓩ</f>covenant,</t>
1-73 <t><f>ⓐ</f> the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us</t>
1-74 <t>that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, </t><t>might serve him <f>ⓑ</f>without fear,</t>
1-75 <t><f>ⓒ</f> in holiness and righteousness before him <f>ⓓ</f>all our days.</t>
1-76 <t>And you, child, will be called <f>ⓔ</f>the prophet of <f>ⓕ</f>the Most High; </t><t>for <f>ⓖ</f>you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,</t>
1-77 <t>to give knowledge of salvation to his people </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>in the forgiveness of their sins,</t>
1-78 <t>because of the <f>ⓘ</f>tender mercy of our God, </t><t>whereby <f>ⓙ</f>the sunrise shall <f>ⓚ</f>visit us <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>from on high</t>
1-79 <t>to <f>ⓜ</f>give light to <f>ⓝ</f>those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, </t><t>to guide our feet into <f>ⓞ</f>the way of <f>ⓟ</f>peace.” </t>
1-80 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was <f>ⓡ</f>in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
