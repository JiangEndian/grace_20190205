Leviticus 24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 24-2 “Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp, that a light may be kept burning regularly.
Leviticus 24-3 Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall arrange it from evening to morning before the LORD regularly. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
Leviticus 24-4 He shall arrange the lamps on the <f>ⓑ</f>lampstand of pure gold <f>[1]</f> before the LORD regularly.
Leviticus 24-5 <pb/>“You shall take fine flour and bake twelve <f>ⓒ</f>loaves from it; two tenths of an ephah <f>[2]</f> shall be in each loaf.
Leviticus 24-6 And you shall set them in two piles, six in a pile, <f>ⓓ</f>on the table of pure gold <f>[3]</f> before the LORD.
Leviticus 24-7 And you shall put pure frankincense on each pile, that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion as a food offering to the LORD.
Leviticus 24-8 <f>ⓔ</f> Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange it before the LORD regularly; it is from the people of Israel as a covenant forever.
Leviticus 24-9 And <f>ⓕ</f>it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and <f>ⓖ</f>they shall eat it in a holy place, since it is for him a most holy portion out of the LORD's food offerings, a perpetual due.”
Leviticus 24-10 <pb/>Now an Israelite woman's son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the people of Israel. And the Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel fought in the camp,
Leviticus 24-11 and the Israelite woman's son <f>ⓗ</f>blasphemed the <f>ⓘ</f>Name, and cursed. Then they <f>ⓙ</f>brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus 24-12 And <f>ⓚ</f>they put him in custody, <f>ⓛ</f>till the will of the LORD should be clear to them.
Leviticus 24-13 <pb/>Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 24-14 <f>ⓜ</f> “Bring out of the camp the one who cursed, and let all who heard him <f>ⓝ</f>lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
Leviticus 24-15 And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall <f>ⓞ</f>bear his sin.
Leviticus 24-16 Whoever <f>ⓟ</f>blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
Leviticus 24-17 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “Whoever takes a human life shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus 24-18 <f>ⓡ</f> Whoever takes an animal's life shall make it good, life for life.
Leviticus 24-19 If anyone injures his neighbor, <f>ⓢ</f>as he has done it shall be done to him,
Leviticus 24-20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; whatever injury he has given a person shall be given to him.
Leviticus 24-21 <f>ⓣ</f> Whoever kills an animal shall make it good, <f>ⓤ</f>and whoever kills a person shall be put to death.
Leviticus 24-22 You shall have the <f>ⓥ</f>same rule for the sojourner and for the native, for I am the LORD your God.”
Leviticus 24-23 So Moses spoke to the people of Israel, and <f>ⓦ</f>they brought out of the camp the one who had cursed and stoned him with stones. Thus the people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Psalm 1-1 <pb/><t>Blessed is the man <f>[1]</f> </t><t>who <f>ⓐ</f>walks not in <f>ⓑ</f>the counsel of the wicked, </t><t>nor stands in <f>ⓒ</f>the way of sinners, </t><t>nor <f>ⓓ</f>sits in <f>ⓔ</f>the seat of <f>ⓕ</f>scoffers;</t>
Psalm 1-2 <t>but his <f>ⓖ</f>delight is in the law <f>[2]</f> of the LORD, </t><t>and on his <f>ⓗ</f>law he meditates day and night. </t>
Psalm 1-3 <pb/><t>He is like <f>ⓘ</f>a tree </t><t>planted by <f>ⓙ</f>streams of water </t><t>that yields its fruit in its season, </t><t>and its <f>ⓚ</f>leaf does not wither. </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>In all that he does, he prospers.</t>
Psalm 1-4 <t>The wicked are not so, </t><t>but are like <f>ⓜ</f>chaff that the wind drives away. </t>
Psalm 1-5 <pb/><t>Therefore the wicked <f>ⓝ</f>will not stand in the judgment, </t><t>nor sinners in <f>ⓞ</f>the congregation of the righteous;</t>
Psalm 1-6 <t>for the LORD <f>ⓟ</f>knows <f>ⓠ</f>the way of the righteous, </t><t>but the way of the wicked will perish. </t>
Ezekiel 42-1 <pb/>Then he led me out into <f>ⓐ</f>the outer court, <f>ⓑ</f>toward the north, and he brought me to <f>ⓒ</f>the chambers that were opposite <f>ⓓ</f>the separate yard and opposite <f>ⓔ</f>the building on the north.
Ezekiel 42-2 The length of the building whose door faced north was <f>ⓕ</f>a hundred cubits, <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>the breadth fifty cubits.
Ezekiel 42-3 Facing <f>ⓗ</f>the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing <f>ⓘ</f>the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was <f>ⓙ</f>gallery <f>[2]</f> against gallery in three stories.
Ezekiel 42-4 And <f>ⓚ</f>before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and <f>ⓛ</f>a hundred cubits long, <f>[3]</f> and <f>ⓜ</f>their doors were on the north.
Ezekiel 42-5 Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building.
Ezekiel 42-6 For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones.
Ezekiel 42-7 And <f>ⓝ</f>there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, <f>ⓞ</f>fifty cubits long.
Ezekiel 42-8 For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite <f>ⓟ</f>the nave <f>[4]</f> were <f>ⓠ</f>a hundred cubits long.
Ezekiel 42-9 Below these chambers was <f>ⓡ</f>an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.
Ezekiel 42-10 <pb/>In the thickness of <f>ⓢ</f>the wall of the court, on the south <f>[5]</f> also, opposite <f>ⓣ</f>the yard and opposite <f>ⓤ</f>the building, there were <f>ⓥ</f>chambers
Ezekiel 42-11 with <f>ⓦ</f>a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits <f>[6]</f> and arrangements and <f>ⓧ</f>doors,
Ezekiel 42-12 as were the entrances of the chambers on the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the passage, the passage before <f>ⓨ</f>the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them. <f>[7]</f>
Ezekiel 42-13 <pb/>Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers opposite <f>ⓩ</f>the yard are the holy chambers, <f>ⓐ</f>where the priests who approach the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>shall eat the <f>ⓒ</f>most holy offerings. There they shall put the most holy offerings — <f>ⓓ</f>the grain offering, <f>ⓔ</f>the sin offering, and <f>ⓕ</f>the guilt offering — for the place is holy.
Ezekiel 42-14 When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court <f>ⓖ</f>without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. <f>ⓗ</f>They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people.”
Ezekiel 42-15 <pb/>Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by <f>ⓘ</f>the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around.
Ezekiel 42-16 He measured the east side with <f>ⓙ</f>the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
Ezekiel 42-17 He measured the north side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
Ezekiel 42-18 He measured the south side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
Ezekiel 42-19 Then he turned to the west side and measured, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
Ezekiel 42-20 He measured it on the four sides. It had <f>ⓚ</f>a wall around it, <f>ⓛ</f>500 cubits long and <f>ⓜ</f>500 cubits broad, <f>ⓝ</f>to make a separation between the holy and the common.
