13-1 <pb/>In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.
13-2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓐ</f>which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from them.
13-3 <f>ⓑ</f> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he gave them continually into the hand of <f>ⓒ</f>Hazael king of Syria and into the hand of <f>ⓓ</f>Ben-hadad the son of Hazael.
13-4 Then Jehoahaz <f>ⓔ</f>sought the favor of the LORD, and the LORD listened to him, <f>ⓕ</f>for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them.
13-5 (Therefore the LORD gave Israel <f>ⓖ</f>a savior, so that they escaped from the hand of the Syrians, and the people of Israel lived in <f>ⓗ</f>their homes as formerly.
13-6 Nevertheless, they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, <f>ⓘ</f>which he made Israel to sin, but walked <f>[1]</f> in them; and <f>ⓙ</f>the Asherah also remained in Samaria.)
13-7 For there was not left to Jehoahaz an army of more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust <f>ⓚ</f>at threshing.
13-8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
13-9 So Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria, and Joash his son reigned in his place.
13-10 <pb/>In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash <f>[2]</f> the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
13-11 He also did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓛ</f>which he made Israel to sin, but he walked in them.
13-12 <f>ⓜ</f> Now the rest of the acts of Joash <f>ⓝ</f>and all that he did, <f>ⓞ</f>and the might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
13-13 So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
13-14 <pb/>Now when Elisha had fallen sick with the illness of which he was to die, Joash king of Israel went down to him and wept before him, crying, <f>ⓟ</f>“My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”
13-15 And Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and arrows.” So he took a bow and arrows.
13-16 Then he said to the king of Israel, “Draw the bow,” and he drew it. And Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands.
13-17 And he said, “Open the window eastward,” and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot,” and he shot. And he said, “The LORD's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria! For you shall fight the Syrians in <f>ⓠ</f>Aphek until you have made an end of them.”
13-18 And he said, “Take the arrows,” and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground with them.” And he struck three times and stopped.
13-19 Then <f>ⓡ</f>the man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it, but now you will strike down Syria only <f>ⓢ</f>three times.”
13-20 <pb/>So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of <f>ⓣ</f>Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year.
13-21 And as a man was being buried, behold, a marauding band was seen and the man was thrown into the grave of Elisha, and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet.
13-22 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Now Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
13-23 <f>ⓥ</f> But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion on them, <f>ⓦ</f>and he turned toward them, <f>ⓧ</f>because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, nor has he cast them from his presence until now.
13-24 <pb/>When Hazael king of Syria died, Ben-hadad his son became king in his place.
13-25 Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities <f>ⓨ</f>that he had taken from Jehoahaz his father in war. <f>ⓩ</f>Three times Joash defeated him and recovered the cities of Israel.
12-1 <pb/><t>You <f>[1]</f> will say <f>ⓐ</f>in that day: </t><t>“I will give thanks to you, O LORD, </t><t>for though you were angry with me, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>your anger turned away, </t><t>that you might comfort me. </t>
12-2 <pb/><t>“Behold, God is my salvation; </t><t>I will trust, and will not be afraid; </t><t>for <f>ⓒ</f>the LORD GOD <f>[2]</f> is my strength and my song, </t><t>and he has become my salvation.” </t>
12-3 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> With joy you <f>[3]</f> will draw water from the wells of salvation.
12-4 <f>ⓔ</f> And you will say in that day: <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f>“Give thanks to the LORD, </t><t>call upon his name, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>make known his deeds among the peoples, </t><t>proclaim <f>ⓗ</f>that his name is exalted. </t>
12-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> “Sing praises to the LORD, for he has done gloriously; </t><t>let this be made known <f>[4]</f> in all the earth.</t>
12-6 <t>Shout, and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, </t><t>for great <f>ⓙ</f>in your <f>[5]</f> midst is <f>ⓚ</f>the Holy One of Israel.” </t>
10-1 <pb/>Brothers, <f>[1]</f> my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
10-2 For I bear them witness that <f>ⓐ</f>they have a zeal for God, <f>ⓑ</f>but not according to knowledge.
10-3 For, being ignorant of <f>ⓒ</f>the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
10-4 For <f>ⓓ</f>Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. <f>[2]</f>
10-5 <pb/>For <f>ⓔ</f>Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that <f>ⓕ</f>the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
10-6 But <f>ⓖ</f>the righteousness based on faith says, <f>ⓗ</f>“Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)
10-7 “or ‘Who will descend into the <f>ⓘ</f>abyss?’” (that is, <f>ⓙ</f>to bring Christ up from the dead).
10-8 But what does it say? <f>ⓚ</f>“The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);
10-9 because, if <f>ⓛ</f>you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and <f>ⓜ</f>believe in your heart <f>ⓝ</f>that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
10-10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
10-11 For the Scripture says, <f>ⓞ</f>“Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”
10-12 <f>ⓟ</f> For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; <f>ⓠ</f>for the same Lord is Lord of all, <f>ⓡ</f>bestowing his riches on all who call on him.
10-13 For <f>ⓢ</f>“everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
10-14 <pb/>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him <f>ⓣ</f>of whom they have never heard? <f>[3]</f> And how are they to hear <f>ⓤ</f>without someone preaching?
10-15 And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, <f>ⓥ</f>“How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!”
10-16 But <f>ⓦ</f>they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, <f>ⓧ</f>“Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?”
10-17 So <f>ⓨ</f>faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.
10-18 <pb/>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f>“Their voice has gone out <f>ⓐ</f>to all the earth, </t><t>and their words to the ends of the world.” </t>
10-19 <pb/>But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f>“I will <f>ⓒ</f>make you jealous of those who are not a nation; </t><t>with a <f>ⓓ</f>foolish nation I will make you angry.” </t>
10-20 <pb/>Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f>“I have been found by those who did not seek me; </t><t>I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.” </t>
10-21 <pb/>But of Israel he says, <f>ⓕ</f>“All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”
