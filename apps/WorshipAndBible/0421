6-1 <pb/>But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with <f>ⓐ</f>a strong hand he will <f>ⓑ</f>drive them out of his land.”
6-2 <pb/>God spoke to Moses and said to him, <f>ⓒ</f>“I am the LORD.
6-3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as <f>ⓓ</f>God Almighty, <f>[1]</f> but by my name the <f>ⓔ</f>LORD I did not make myself known to them.
6-4 <f>ⓕ</f> I also established my covenant with them <f>ⓖ</f>to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners.
6-5 Moreover, <f>ⓗ</f>I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant.
6-6 Say therefore to the people of Israel, <f>ⓘ</f>‘I am the LORD, and <f>ⓙ</f>I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and <f>ⓚ</f>I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.
6-7 I <f>ⓛ</f>will take you to be my people, and <f>ⓜ</f>I will be your God, and you shall know that <f>ⓝ</f>I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out <f>ⓞ</f>from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
6-8 I will bring you into <f>ⓟ</f>the land that I <f>ⓠ</f>swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you for a possession. <f>ⓡ</f>I am the LORD.’”
6-9 Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they <f>ⓢ</f>did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.
6-10 <pb/>So the LORD said to Moses,
6-11 “Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land.”
6-12 But Moses said to the LORD, “Behold, the people of Israel have <f>ⓣ</f>not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, for <f>ⓤ</f>I am of uncircumcised lips?”
6-13 But the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge about the people of Israel and about Pharaoh king of Egypt: to bring the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
6-14 <pb/>These are the heads of their fathers' houses: the <f>ⓥ</f>sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the clans of Reuben.
6-15 The <f>ⓦ</f>sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the clans of Simeon.
6-16 These are the names of the <f>ⓧ</f>sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi being 137 years.
6-17 The <f>ⓨ</f>sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their clans.
6-18 The <f>ⓩ</f>sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, the years of the life of Kohath being 133 years.
6-19 The <f>ⓐ</f>sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites according to their generations.
6-20 <f>ⓑ</f> Amram took as his wife Jochebed his father's sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the years of the life of Amram being 137 years.
6-21 <f>ⓒ</f> The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
6-22 The <f>ⓓ</f>sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
6-23 Aaron took as his wife Elisheba, the daughter of <f>ⓔ</f>Amminadab and the sister of <f>ⓕ</f>Nahshon, and she bore him <f>ⓖ</f>Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
6-24 The <f>ⓗ</f>sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the clans of the Korahites.
6-25 Eleazar, Aaron's son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel, and <f>ⓘ</f>she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites by their clans.
6-26 <pb/>These are the Aaron and Moses <f>ⓙ</f>to whom the LORD said: “Bring out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt <f>ⓚ</f>by their hosts.”
6-27 It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the people of Israel from Egypt, this Moses and this Aaron.
6-28 <pb/>On the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
6-29 the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓛ</f>“I am the LORD; <f>ⓜ</f>tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you.”
6-30 But Moses said to the LORD, “Behold, <f>ⓝ</f>I am of uncircumcised lips. How will Pharaoh listen to me?”
8-1 <pb/>And all the people gathered as one man into the square before <f>ⓐ</f>the Water Gate. And they told <f>ⓑ</f>Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses that the LORD had commanded Israel.
8-2 So Ezra the priest <f>ⓒ</f>brought the Law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could understand what they heard, <f>ⓓ</f>on the first day of the seventh month.
8-3 <f>ⓔ</f> And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.
8-4 And Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform that they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand, and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left hand.
8-5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people, and as he opened it all the people stood.
8-6 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people answered, <f>ⓕ</f>“Amen, Amen,” <f>ⓖ</f>lifting up their hands. <f>ⓗ</f>And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
8-7 <f>ⓘ</f> Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓙ</f>helped the people to understand the Law, <f>ⓚ</f>while the people remained in their places.
8-8 They read from the book, from the Law of God, clearly, <f>[2]</f> and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.
8-9 <pb/>And Nehemiah, who was <f>ⓛ</f>the governor, and Ezra <f>ⓜ</f>the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, <f>ⓝ</f>“This day is holy to the LORD your God; <f>ⓞ</f>do not mourn or weep.” For all the people wept as they heard the words of the Law.
8-10 Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine and <f>ⓟ</f>send portions to anyone who has nothing ready, for this day is holy to our Lord. And do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”
8-11 So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day is holy; do not be grieved.”
8-12 And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because <f>ⓠ</f>they had understood the words that were declared to them.
8-13 <pb/>On the second day the heads of fathers' houses of all the people, with the priests and the Levites, came together to Ezra the scribe in order to study the words of the Law.
8-14 And they found it written in the Law that the LORD had commanded by Moses <f>ⓡ</f>that the people of Israel should dwell in booths <f>[3]</f> during the feast of the seventh month,
8-15 and that they should proclaim it and <f>ⓢ</f>publish it in all their towns and <f>ⓣ</f>in Jerusalem, “Go out to the hills and bring <f>ⓤ</f>branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make booths, as it is written.”
8-16 So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each <f>ⓥ</f>on his roof, and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at <f>ⓦ</f>the Water Gate and in the square at <f>ⓧ</f>the Gate of Ephraim.
8-17 And all the assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in the booths, for from the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day <f>ⓨ</f>the people of Israel had not done so. And there was <f>ⓩ</f>very great rejoicing.
8-18 And day by day, from the first day to the last day, <f>ⓐ</f>he read from the Book of the Law of God. They kept the feast seven days, and <f>ⓑ</f>on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the rule.
41-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at <f>ⓑ</f>Mizpah. As they <f>ⓒ</f>ate bread together there at Mizpah,
41-2 <f>ⓓ</f> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, <f>ⓔ</f>whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land.
41-3 Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at <f>ⓕ</f>Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.
41-4 <pb/>On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,
41-5 eighty men arrived from <f>ⓖ</f>Shechem and <f>ⓗ</f>Shiloh and <f>ⓘ</f>Samaria, with <f>ⓙ</f>their beards shaved and <f>ⓚ</f>their clothes torn, and <f>ⓛ</f>their bodies gashed, <f>ⓜ</f>bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD.
41-6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from <f>ⓝ</f>Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”
41-7 When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern.
41-8 But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death, for we have <f>ⓞ</f>stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.
41-9 <pb/>Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with <f>[1]</f> Gedaliah was the large cistern that <f>ⓟ</f>King Asa had made for defense against <f>ⓠ</f>Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
41-10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, <f>ⓡ</f>the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom <f>ⓢ</f>Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to <f>ⓣ</f>the Ammonites.
41-11 <pb/>But when <f>ⓤ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓥ</f>all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
41-12 they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at <f>ⓦ</f>the great pool that is in <f>ⓧ</f>Gibeon.
41-13 And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓨ</f>all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced.
41-14 <f>ⓩ</f> So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
41-15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to <f>ⓐ</f>the Ammonites.
41-16 Then Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓑ</f>all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam — soldiers, <f>ⓒ</f>women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from <f>ⓓ</f>Gibeon.
41-17 And they went and stayed at Geruth <f>ⓔ</f>Chimham near <f>ⓕ</f>Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt
41-18 because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, <f>ⓖ</f>whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
1-1 <pb/>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, <pb/>To those who are elect exiles of <f>ⓐ</f>the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
1-2 according to <f>ⓑ</f>the foreknowledge of God the Father, <f>ⓒ</f>in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and <f>ⓓ</f>for sprinkling with his blood: <pb/>May <f>ⓔ</f>grace and <f>ⓕ</f>peace be multiplied to you.
1-3 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! <f>ⓗ</f>According to his great mercy, <f>ⓘ</f>he has caused us to be born again to a living hope <f>ⓙ</f>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
1-4 to <f>ⓚ</f>an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and <f>ⓛ</f>unfading, <f>ⓜ</f>kept in heaven for you,
1-5 who by God's power are being guarded <f>ⓝ</f>through faith for a salvation <f>ⓞ</f>ready to be revealed in the last time.
1-6 In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by <f>ⓟ</f>various trials,
1-7 so that <f>ⓠ</f>the tested genuineness of your faith — more precious than gold that perishes <f>ⓡ</f>though it is tested by <f>ⓢ</f>fire — may be found to result in <f>ⓣ</f>praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
1-8 <f>ⓤ</f> Though you have not seen him, you love him. <f>ⓥ</f>Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
1-9 obtaining <f>ⓦ</f>the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
1-10 <pb/>Concerning this salvation, <f>ⓧ</f>the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully,
1-11 inquiring <f>ⓨ</f>what person or time <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating <f>ⓐ</f>when he predicted <f>ⓑ</f>the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
1-12 <f>ⓒ</f> It was revealed to them that <f>ⓓ</f>they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you <f>ⓔ</f>by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, <f>ⓕ</f>things into which angels long to look.
1-13 <pb/>Therefore, <f>ⓖ</f>preparing your minds for action, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓗ</f>being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
1-14 As obedient children, <f>ⓘ</f>do not be conformed to the passions <f>ⓙ</f>of your former ignorance,
1-15 but <f>ⓚ</f>as he who called you is holy, you also be holy <f>ⓛ</f>in all your conduct,
1-16 since it is written, <f>ⓜ</f>“You shall be holy, for I am holy.”
1-17 And if you <f>ⓝ</f>call on him as Father who <f>ⓞ</f>judges <f>ⓟ</f>impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves <f>ⓠ</f>with fear throughout the time of your exile,
1-18 knowing that you <f>ⓡ</f>were ransomed from <f>ⓢ</f>the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
1-19 but <f>ⓣ</f>with the precious blood of Christ, like that of <f>ⓤ</f>a lamb <f>ⓥ</f>without blemish or spot.
1-20 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but <f>ⓦ</f>was made manifest <f>ⓧ</f>in the last times for the sake of you
1-21 <f>ⓨ</f> who through him are believers in God, <f>ⓩ</f>who raised him from the dead and <f>ⓐ</f>gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
1-22 <pb/>Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for <f>ⓑ</f>a sincere brotherly love, <f>ⓒ</f>love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
1-23 <f>ⓓ</f> since you have been born again, <f>ⓔ</f>not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through <f>ⓕ</f>the living and abiding word of God;
1-24 for <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“All flesh is like grass </t><t>and all its glory like the flower of grass. </t><t>The grass withers, </t><t>and the flower falls,</t>
1-25 <t><f>ⓗ</f> but the word of the Lord remains forever.” </t> <pb/>And this word <f>ⓘ</f>is the good news that was preached to you.
