Deuteronomy 3-1 <pb/>“Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And <f>ⓐ</f>Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at <f>ⓑ</f>Edrei.
Deuteronomy 3-2 But the LORD said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to <f>ⓒ</f>Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.’
Deuteronomy 3-3 So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, <f>ⓓ</f>and we struck him down until he had no survivor left.
Deuteronomy 3-4 And we took all his cities at that time — there was not a city that we did not take from them — sixty cities, <f>ⓔ</f>the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy 3-5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages.
Deuteronomy 3-6 And <f>ⓕ</f>we devoted them to destruction, <f>[1]</f> as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every <f>ⓖ</f>city, men, women, and children.
Deuteronomy 3-7 But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder.
Deuteronomy 3-8 So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon
Deuteronomy 3-9 (the Sidonians call <f>ⓗ</f>Hermon <f>ⓘ</f>Sirion, while the Amorites call it <f>ⓙ</f>Senir),
Deuteronomy 3-10 all the cities of the <f>ⓚ</f>tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as <f>ⓛ</f>Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy 3-11 (For <f>ⓜ</f>only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of <f>ⓝ</f>the Rephaim. Behold, his bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in <f>ⓞ</f>Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits <f>[2]</f> was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the <f>ⓟ</f>common cubit. <f>[3]</f>)
Deuteronomy 3-12 <pb/>“When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning <f>ⓠ</f>at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with <f>ⓡ</f>its cities.
Deuteronomy 3-13 <f>ⓢ</f> The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, <f>ⓣ</f>all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All that portion of Bashan is called the land of <f>ⓤ</f>Rephaim.
Deuteronomy 3-14 <f>ⓥ</f> Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of <f>ⓦ</f>the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages <f>ⓧ</f>after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)
Deuteronomy 3-15 To Machir <f>ⓨ</f>I gave Gilead,
Deuteronomy 3-16 and to the Reubenites <f>ⓩ</f>and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, <f>ⓐ</f>the border of the Ammonites;
Deuteronomy 3-17 the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from <f>ⓑ</f>Chinnereth as far as <f>ⓒ</f>the Sea of the Arabah, <f>ⓓ</f>the Salt Sea, under <f>ⓔ</f>the slopes of Pisgah on the east.
Deuteronomy 3-18 <pb/>“And I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. <f>ⓕ</f>All your men of valor shall cross over armed before your brothers, the people of Israel.
Deuteronomy 3-19 Only your wives, your little ones, and your livestock <f>ⓖ</f>(I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities that I have given you,
Deuteronomy 3-20 <f>ⓗ</f> until the LORD gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also occupy the land that the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.’
Deuteronomy 3-21 And I commanded <f>ⓘ</f>Joshua at that time, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing.
Deuteronomy 3-22 You shall not fear them, for it is <f>ⓙ</f>the LORD your God who fights for you.’
Deuteronomy 3-23 <pb/>“And I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,
Deuteronomy 3-24 ‘O Lord GOD, you have only begun to show your servant <f>ⓚ</f>your greatness and your mighty hand. For <f>ⓛ</f>what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours?
Deuteronomy 3-25 Please let me go over and see <f>ⓜ</f>the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and <f>ⓝ</f>Lebanon.’
Deuteronomy 3-26 But <f>ⓞ</f>the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. And the LORD said to me, <f>ⓟ</f>‘Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again.
Deuteronomy 3-27 <f>ⓠ</f> Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy 3-28 But <f>ⓡ</f>charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.’
Deuteronomy 3-29 So we remained in <f>ⓢ</f>the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Psalm 43-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Vindicate me, O God, and <f>ⓑ</f>defend my cause </t><t>against an ungodly people, </t><t>from <f>ⓒ</f>the deceitful and unjust man </t><t>deliver me!</t>
Psalm 43-2 <t>For you are <f>ⓓ</f>the God in whom I take refuge; </t><t>why have you <f>ⓔ</f>rejected me? </t><t>Why do I <f>ⓕ</f>go about mourning </t><t>because of the oppression of the enemy? </t>
Psalm 43-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> Send out your light and your truth; </t><t>let them lead me; </t><t>let them bring me to your <f>ⓗ</f>holy hill </t><t>and to your <f>ⓘ</f>dwelling!</t>
Psalm 43-4 <t>Then I will go to the altar of God, </t><t>to God my exceeding joy, </t><t>and I will praise you with the lyre, </t><t>O God, my God. </t>
Psalm 43-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Why are you cast down, O my soul, </t><t>and why are you in turmoil within me? </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, </t><t>my salvation and my God. </t>
Amos 7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, <f>ⓑ</f>he was forming locusts when the latter growth was just beginning to sprout, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.
Amos 7-2 When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said, <pb/><t>“O Lord GOD, please forgive! </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>How can Jacob stand? </t><t>He is so small!”</t>
Amos 7-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> The LORD relented concerning this: </t><t>“It shall not be,” said the LORD. </t>
Amos 7-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, the Lord GOD was calling <f>ⓕ</f>for a judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land.
Amos 7-5 Then I said, <pb/><t>“O Lord GOD, please cease! </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>How can Jacob stand? </t><t>He is so small!”</t>
Amos 7-6 <t><f>ⓗ</f> The LORD relented concerning this: </t><t>“This also shall not be,” said the Lord GOD. </t>
Amos 7-7 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> This is what he showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with <f>ⓙ</f>a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.
Amos 7-8 And the LORD said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said, <pb/><t>“Behold, I am setting <f>ⓛ</f>a plumb line </t><t>in the midst of my people Israel; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>I will never again pass by them;</t>
Amos 7-9 <t><f>ⓝ</f> the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, </t><t>and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, </t><t>and I will rise against <f>ⓞ</f>the house of Jeroboam with the sword.” </t>
Amos 7-10 <pb/>Then Amaziah <f>ⓟ</f>the priest of Bethel sent to <f>ⓠ</f>Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has <f>ⓡ</f>conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.
Amos 7-11 For thus Amos has said, <pb/><t>“‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>Israel must go into exile </t><t>away from his land.’” </t>
Amos 7-12 <pb/>And Amaziah said to Amos, <f>ⓣ</f>“O seer, go, flee away <f>ⓤ</f>to the land of Judah, and <f>ⓥ</f>eat bread there, and prophesy there,
Amos 7-13 but <f>ⓦ</f>never again prophesy at Bethel, for <f>ⓧ</f>it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.”
Amos 7-14 <pb/>Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, <f>ⓨ</f>“I was <f>[1]</f> no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but <f>ⓩ</f>I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs.
Amos 7-15 <f>ⓐ</f> But the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’
Amos 7-16 <f>ⓑ</f> Now therefore hear the word of the LORD. <pb/><t>“You say, <f>ⓒ</f>‘Do not prophesy against Israel, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>do not preach against the house of <f>ⓔ</f>Isaac.’ </t>
Amos 7-17 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Therefore thus says the LORD: <pb/><t>“‘Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, </t><t>and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, </t><t>and your land <f>ⓖ</f>shall be divided up with a measuring line; </t><t>you yourself shall die in an unclean land, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.’” </t>
