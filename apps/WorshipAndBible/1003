10-1 <pb/>After Abimelech there arose to <f>ⓐ</f>save Israel Tola the son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he lived at Shamir in <f>ⓑ</f>the hill country of Ephraim.
10-2 And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried at Shamir.
10-3 <pb/>After him arose Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years.
10-4 And he had thirty sons who <f>ⓒ</f>rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities, called Havvoth-jair to this day, <f>ⓓ</f>which are in the land of Gilead.
10-5 And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
10-6 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD <f>ⓕ</f>and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, <f>ⓖ</f>the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. And they <f>ⓗ</f>forsook the LORD and did not serve him.
10-7 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and <f>ⓘ</f>he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites,
10-8 and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
10-9 And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.
10-10 <pb/>And the people of Israel <f>ⓙ</f>cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against you, because <f>ⓚ</f>we have forsaken our God and have served the Baals.”
10-11 And the LORD said to the people of Israel, “Did I not save you <f>ⓛ</f>from the Egyptians and <f>ⓜ</f>from the Amorites, <f>ⓝ</f>from the Ammonites and <f>ⓞ</f>from the Philistines?
10-12 The Sidonians also, and <f>ⓟ</f>the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, and you cried out to me, and I <f>ⓠ</f>saved you out of their hand.
10-13 Yet you have <f>ⓡ</f>forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more.
10-14 Go and cry out <f>ⓢ</f>to the gods whom you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.”
10-15 And the people of Israel said to the LORD, “We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you. Only please deliver us this day.”
10-16 So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and <f>ⓣ</f>he became impatient over the misery of Israel.
10-17 <pb/>Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead. And the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at <f>ⓤ</f>Mizpah.
10-18 And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? <f>ⓥ</f>He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
108-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> My heart is steadfast, O God! </t><t>I will sing and make melody with all my being! <f>[1]</f></t>
108-2 <t>Awake, O harp and lyre! </t><t>I will awake the dawn!</t>
108-3 <t>I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the peoples; </t><t>I will sing praises to you among the nations.</t>
108-4 <t>For your steadfast love is great <f>ⓑ</f>above the heavens; </t><t>your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. </t>
108-5 <pb/><t>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! </t><t>Let your glory be over all the earth!</t>
108-6 <t><f>ⓒ</f> That your beloved ones may be delivered, </t><t>give salvation by your right hand and answer me! </t>
108-7 <pb/><t>God has promised in his holiness: <f>[2]</f> </t><t>“With exultation I will divide up Shechem </t><t>and portion out the Valley of Succoth.</t>
108-8 <t>Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; </t><t>Ephraim is my helmet, </t><t>Judah my scepter.</t>
108-9 <t>Moab is my washbasin; </t><t>upon Edom I cast my shoe; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>over Philistia I shout in triumph.” </t>
108-10 <pb/><t>Who will bring me to the fortified city? </t><t>Who will lead me to Edom?</t>
108-11 <t>Have you not rejected us, O God? </t><t>You do not go out, O God, with our armies.</t>
108-12 <t>Oh grant us help against the foe, </t><t>for vain is the salvation of man!</t>
108-13 <t>With God we shall do valiantly; </t><t>it is he who will tread down our foes. </t>
22-1 <pb/>And again Jesus <f>ⓐ</f>spoke to them in parables, saying,
22-2 <J><f>ⓑ</f> “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave <f>ⓒ</f>a wedding feast for his son,</J>
22-3 <J>and <f>ⓓ</f>sent his servants <f>[1]</f> to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.</J>
22-4 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my <f>ⓕ</f>dinner, <f>ⓖ</f>my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’</J>
22-5 <J>But <f>ⓗ</f>they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,</J>
22-6 <J>while the rest seized his servants, <f>ⓘ</f>treated them shamefully, and <f>ⓙ</f>killed them.</J>
22-7 <J>The king was angry, and he sent his troops and <f>ⓚ</f>destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</J>
22-8 <J>Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not <f>ⓛ</f>worthy.</J>
22-9 <J>Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’</J>
22-10 <J>And those servants went out into the roads and <f>ⓜ</f>gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.</J>
22-11 <pb/><J>“But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there <f>ⓝ</f>a man who had no wedding garment.</J>
22-12 <J>And he said to him, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.</J>
22-13 <J>Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and <f>ⓟ</f>cast him into the outer darkness. In that place <f>ⓠ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</J>
22-14 <J>For many are <f>ⓡ</f>called, but few are <f>ⓢ</f>chosen.”</J>
22-15 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Then the Pharisees went and plotted how <f>ⓤ</f>to entangle him in his words.
22-16 And they sent <f>ⓥ</f>their disciples to him, along with <f>ⓦ</f>the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, <f>ⓧ</f>we know that you are true and teach <f>ⓨ</f>the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for <f>ⓩ</f>you are not swayed by appearances. <f>[2]</f>
22-17 Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay <f>ⓐ</f>taxes to <f>ⓑ</f>Caesar, or not?”
22-18 But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, <J>“Why <f>ⓒ</f>put me to the test, you hypocrites?</J>
22-19 <J>Show me the coin for the tax.”</J> And they brought him a denarius. <f>[3]</f>
22-20 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Whose likeness and inscription is this?”</J>
22-21 They said, “Caesar's.” Then he said to them, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</J>
22-22 When they heard it, they marveled. And they <f>ⓔ</f>left him and went away.
22-23 <pb/>The same day <f>ⓕ</f>Sadducees came to him, <f>ⓖ</f>who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question,
22-24 saying, “Teacher, Moses said, <f>ⓗ</f>‘If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.’
22-25 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother.
22-26 So too the second and third, down to the seventh.
22-27 After them all, the woman died.
22-28 In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.”
22-29 <pb/>But Jesus answered them, <J>“You are wrong, <f>ⓘ</f>because you know neither the Scriptures nor <f>ⓙ</f>the power of God.</J>
22-30 <J>For in the resurrection they neither <f>ⓚ</f>marry nor <f>ⓛ</f>are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</J>
22-31 <J>And as for the resurrection of the dead, <f>ⓜ</f>have you not read what was said to you by God:</J>
22-32 <J><f>ⓝ</f> ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.”</J>
22-33 And when the crowd heard it, <f>ⓞ</f>they were astonished at his teaching.
22-34 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced <f>ⓠ</f>the Sadducees, they gathered together.
22-35 <f>ⓡ</f> And one of them, <f>ⓢ</f>a lawyer, asked him a question <f>ⓣ</f>to test him.
22-36 “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?”
22-37 And he said to him, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.</J>
22-38 <J>This is the great and first commandment.</J>
22-39 <J>And <f>ⓥ</f>a second is like it: <f>ⓦ</f>You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</J>
22-40 <J><f>ⓧ</f> On these two commandments depend <f>ⓨ</f>all the Law and the Prophets.”</J>
22-41 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> Now while the Pharisees <f>ⓐ</f>were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
22-42 saying, <J>“What do you think about <f>ⓑ</f>the Christ? Whose son is he?”</J> They said to him, <f>ⓒ</f>“The son of David.”
22-43 He said to them, <J>“How is it then that David, <f>ⓓ</f>in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,</J>
22-44 <pb/><t><J><f>ⓔ</f> “‘The Lord said to my Lord,</J> </t><t><J>“Sit at my right hand,</J> </t><t><J>until I put your enemies under your feet”’?</J> </t>
22-45 <pb/><J>If then David calls him Lord, <f>ⓕ</f>how is he his son?”</J>
22-46 <f>ⓖ</f> And no one was able to answer him a word, <f>ⓗ</f>nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.
