13-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
13-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel. From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them.”
13-3 So Moses sent them from <f>ⓑ</f>the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel.
13-4 And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
13-5 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
13-6 <f>ⓒ</f> from the tribe of Judah, <f>ⓓ</f>Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
13-7 from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
13-8 from the tribe of Ephraim, <f>ⓔ</f>Hoshea the son of Nun;
13-9 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
13-10 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
13-11 from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi;
13-12 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
13-13 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
13-14 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
13-15 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
13-16 These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called <f>ⓕ</f>Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
13-17 <pb/>Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, “Go up into <f>ⓖ</f>the Negeb and go up into <f>ⓗ</f>the hill country,
13-18 and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,
13-19 and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,
13-20 and whether the land is <f>ⓘ</f>rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. <f>ⓙ</f>Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
13-21 <pb/>So they went up and spied out the land <f>ⓚ</f>from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, <f>ⓛ</f>near Lebo-hamath.
13-22 They went up into <f>ⓜ</f>the Negeb and came to <f>ⓝ</f>Hebron. <f>ⓞ</f>Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the <f>ⓟ</f>descendants of Anak, were there. (<f>ⓠ</f>Hebron was built seven years before <f>ⓡ</f>Zoan in Egypt.)
13-23 And <f>ⓢ</f>they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they also brought some pomegranates and figs.
13-24 That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, <f>[1]</f> because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there.
13-25 <pb/>At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.
13-26 And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at <f>ⓣ</f>Kadesh. They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
13-27 And they told him, “We came to the land to which you sent us. It <f>ⓤ</f>flows with milk and honey, <f>ⓥ</f>and this is its fruit.
13-28 <f>ⓦ</f> However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
13-29 <f>ⓧ</f> The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. <f>ⓨ</f>And the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan.”
13-30 <pb/>But <f>ⓩ</f>Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it.”
13-31 <f>ⓐ</f> Then the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are.”
13-32 So <f>ⓑ</f>they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and <f>ⓒ</f>all the people that we saw in it are of great height.
13-33 And there we saw the <f>ⓓ</f>Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the <f>ⓔ</f>Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves <f>ⓕ</f>like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.”
17-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Hear a just cause, O LORD; <f>ⓑ</f>attend to my cry! </t><t>Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!</t>
17-2 <t>From your presence <f>ⓒ</f>let my vindication come! </t><t>Let your eyes behold the right! </t>
17-3 <pb/><t>You have <f>ⓓ</f>tried my heart, you have <f>ⓔ</f>visited me by <f>ⓕ</f>night, </t><t>you have <f>ⓖ</f>tested me, and you will find nothing; </t><t>I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.</t>
17-4 <t>With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips </t><t>I have avoided the ways of the violent.</t>
17-5 <t>My steps have <f>ⓗ</f>held fast to your paths; </t><t>my feet have not slipped. </t>
17-6 <pb/><t>I <f>ⓘ</f>call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>incline your ear to me; hear my words.</t>
17-7 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Wondrously show <f>[1]</f> your steadfast love, </t><t>O Savior of those who seek refuge </t><t>from <f>ⓛ</f>their adversaries at your right hand. </t>
17-8 <pb/><t>Keep me as <f>ⓜ</f>the apple of your eye; </t><t>hide me in <f>ⓝ</f>the shadow of your wings,</t>
17-9 <t>from the wicked who do me violence, </t><t>my deadly enemies who <f>ⓞ</f>surround me. </t>
17-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> They close their hearts to pity; </t><t>with their mouths they <f>ⓠ</f>speak arrogantly.</t>
17-11 <t>They have now surrounded our <f>ⓡ</f>steps; </t><t>they set their eyes to <f>ⓢ</f>cast us to the ground.</t>
17-12 <t>He is like a lion eager to tear, </t><t>as a young lion <f>ⓣ</f>lurking in ambush. </t>
17-13 <pb/><t>Arise, O LORD! Confront him, subdue him! </t><t>Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,</t>
17-14 <t>from men by your hand, O LORD, </t><t>from <f>ⓤ</f>men of the world whose <f>ⓥ</f>portion is in this life. <f>[2]</f> </t><t>You fill their womb with treasure; <f>[3]</f> </t><t>they are satisfied with <f>ⓦ</f>children, </t><t>and they leave their abundance to their infants. </t>
17-15 <pb/><t>As for me, I shall <f>ⓧ</f>behold your face in righteousness; </t><t>when I <f>ⓨ</f>awake, I shall be <f>ⓩ</f>satisfied with your likeness. </t>
10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, <f>ⓑ</f>who was named Belteshazzar. And <f>ⓒ</f>the word was true, and it was a great conflict. <f>[1]</f> And <f>ⓓ</f>he understood the word and <f>ⓔ</f>had understanding of the vision.
10-2 <pb/>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for <f>ⓕ</f>three weeks.
10-3 I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I <f>ⓖ</f>anoint myself at all, for <f>ⓗ</f>the full three weeks.
10-4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing <f>ⓘ</f>on the bank of the great river (<f>ⓙ</f>that is, the Tigris)
10-5 <f>ⓚ</f> I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, <f>ⓛ</f>a man clothed in linen, <f>ⓜ</f>with a belt of fine <f>ⓝ</f>gold from Uphaz around his waist.
10-6 His body was like <f>ⓞ</f>beryl, his face <f>ⓟ</f>like the appearance of lightning, <f>ⓠ</f>his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and <f>ⓡ</f>legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and <f>ⓢ</f>the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.
10-7 <f>ⓣ</f> And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
10-8 So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and <f>ⓤ</f>no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>and I retained no strength.
10-9 Then I heard the sound of his words, <f>ⓦ</f>and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep <f>ⓧ</f>with my face to the ground.
10-10 <pb/>And behold, <f>ⓨ</f>a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
10-11 And he said to me, “O Daniel, <f>ⓩ</f>man greatly loved, <f>ⓐ</f>understand the words that I speak to you, and <f>ⓑ</f>stand upright, for <f>ⓒ</f>now I have been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.
10-12 Then he said to me, <f>ⓓ</f>“Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you <f>ⓔ</f>set your heart to understand and <f>ⓕ</f>humbled yourself before your God, <f>ⓖ</f>your words have been heard, <f>ⓗ</f>and I have come because of your words.
10-13 <f>ⓘ</f> The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me <f>ⓙ</f>twenty-one days, but <f>ⓚ</f>Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia,
10-14 <f>ⓛ</f> and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people <f>ⓜ</f>in the latter days. For <f>ⓝ</f>the vision is for days yet to come.”
10-15 <pb/>When he had spoken to me according to these words, <f>ⓞ</f>I turned my face toward the ground <f>ⓟ</f>and was mute.
10-16 And behold, <f>ⓠ</f>one in the likeness of the children of man <f>ⓡ</f>touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, “O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and <f>ⓢ</f>I retain no strength.
10-17 How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.”
10-18 <pb/>Again <f>ⓣ</f>one having the appearance of a man <f>ⓤ</f>touched me and strengthened me.
10-19 And he said, <f>ⓥ</f>“O man greatly loved, <f>ⓦ</f>fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.” And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”
10-20 Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the <f>ⓧ</f>prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of <f>ⓨ</f>Greece will come.
10-21 But I will tell you <f>ⓩ</f>what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except <f>ⓐ</f>Michael, your prince.
