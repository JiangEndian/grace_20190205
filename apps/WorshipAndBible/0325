Genesis 29-1 <pb/>Then Jacob went on his journey and came to <f>ⓐ</f>the land of the people of the east.
Genesis 29-2 As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large,
Genesis 29-3 and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.
Genesis 29-4 <pb/>Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where do you come from?” They said, <f>ⓑ</f>“We are from Haran.”
Genesis 29-5 He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.”
Genesis 29-6 He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!”
Genesis 29-7 He said, “Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them.”
Genesis 29-8 But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”
Genesis 29-9 <pb/>While he was still speaking with them, <f>ⓒ</f>Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
Genesis 29-10 Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
Genesis 29-11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.
Genesis 29-12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was <f>ⓓ</f>her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son, <f>ⓔ</f>and she ran and told her father.
Genesis 29-13 <pb/>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, <f>ⓕ</f>he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,
Genesis 29-14 and Laban said to him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Surely you are my bone and my flesh!” And he stayed with him a month.
Genesis 29-15 <pb/>Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?”
Genesis 29-16 Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Genesis 29-17 Leah's eyes were weak, <f>[1]</f> but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.
Genesis 29-18 Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, <f>ⓗ</f>“I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”
Genesis 29-19 Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.”
Genesis 29-20 So Jacob <f>ⓘ</f>served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.
Genesis 29-21 <pb/>Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.”
Genesis 29-22 So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and <f>ⓙ</f>made a feast.
Genesis 29-23 But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her.
Genesis 29-24 (Laban gave <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)
Genesis 29-25 And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”
Genesis 29-26 Laban said, “It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
Genesis 29-27 <f>ⓛ</f> Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.”
Genesis 29-28 Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
Genesis 29-29 (Laban gave <f>ⓜ</f>his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)
Genesis 29-30 So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban <f>ⓝ</f>for another seven years.
Genesis 29-31 <pb/>When the LORD saw that Leah was <f>ⓞ</f>hated, <f>ⓟ</f>he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
Genesis 29-32 And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, <f>[3]</f> for she said, “Because the LORD <f>ⓠ</f>has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.”
Genesis 29-33 She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also.” And she called his name Simeon. <f>[4]</f>
Genesis 29-34 Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will be <f>ⓡ</f>attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi. <f>[5]</f>
Genesis 29-35 And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” Therefore she called his name <f>ⓢ</f>Judah. <f>[6]</f> Then she ceased bearing.
2 Chronicles 27-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
2 Chronicles 27-2 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD according to all that his father Uzziah had done, <f>ⓑ</f>except he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still followed corrupt practices.
2 Chronicles 27-3 He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD and did much building on the wall of <f>ⓒ</f>Ophel.
2 Chronicles 27-4 Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills.
2 Chronicles 27-5 He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year 100 talents <f>[1]</f> of silver, and 10,000 cors <f>[2]</f> of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years.
2 Chronicles 27-6 So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles 27-7 <f>ⓓ</f> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles 27-8 He was <f>ⓔ</f>twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 27-9 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
Jeremiah 14-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning <f>ⓐ</f>the drought:
Jeremiah 14-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> “Judah mourns, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>her gates languish; </t><t>her people lament on the ground, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>the cry of Jerusalem goes up.</t>
Jeremiah 14-3 <t>Her nobles send their servants for water; </t><t>they come to the cisterns; </t><t>they find no water; </t><t>they return with their vessels empty; </t><t>they are <f>ⓔ</f>ashamed and confounded </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>cover their heads.</t>
Jeremiah 14-4 <t>Because of the ground that is dismayed, </t><t>since there is <f>ⓖ</f>no rain on the land, </t><t>the farmers are ashamed; </t><t>they cover their heads.</t>
Jeremiah 14-5 <t>Even <f>ⓗ</f>the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn </t><t>because there is no grass.</t>
Jeremiah 14-6 <t><f>ⓘ</f> The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; </t><t>they pant for air like jackals; </t><t>their eyes fail </t><t>because there is no vegetation. </t>
Jeremiah 14-7 <pb/><t>“Though our iniquities testify against us, </t><t>act, O LORD, <f>ⓙ</f>for your name's sake; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>for our backslidings are many; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>we have sinned against you.</t>
Jeremiah 14-8 <t><f>ⓜ</f> O you hope of Israel, </t><t>its savior in time of trouble, </t><t>why should you be like a stranger in the land, </t><t>like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night?</t>
Jeremiah 14-9 <t>Why should you be like a man confused, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>like a mighty warrior who cannot save? </t><t>Yet <f>ⓞ</f>you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>we are called by your name; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>do not leave us.” </t>
Jeremiah 14-10 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD concerning this people: </t><t>“They have loved to wander thus; </t><t>they have not restrained their feet; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>therefore the LORD does not accept them; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>now he will remember their iniquity </t><t>and punish their sins.” </t>
Jeremiah 14-11 <pb/>The LORD said to me: <f>ⓣ</f>“Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
Jeremiah 14-12 Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, <f>ⓤ</f>and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them <f>ⓥ</f>by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”
Jeremiah 14-13 <pb/>Then I said: “Ah, Lord GOD, behold, the prophets <f>ⓦ</f>say to them, ‘You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.’”
Jeremiah 14-14 And the LORD said to me: “The <f>ⓧ</f>prophets are prophesying lies in my name. <f>ⓨ</f>I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, <f>ⓩ</f>worthless divination, and <f>ⓐ</f>the deceit of their own minds.
Jeremiah 14-15 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although <f>ⓑ</f>I did not send them, and who say, <f>ⓒ</f>‘Sword and famine shall not come upon this land’: <f>ⓓ</f>By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.
Jeremiah 14-16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, <f>ⓔ</f>with none to bury them — them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their evil upon them.
Jeremiah 14-17 <pb/><t>“You shall say to them this word: </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, </t><t>and let them not cease, </t><t>for the virgin <f>ⓖ</f>daughter of my people is shattered with a great wound, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>with a very grievous blow.</t>
Jeremiah 14-18 <t><f>ⓘ</f> If I go out into the field, </t><t>behold, those pierced by the sword! </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>And if I enter the city, </t><t>behold, the diseases of famine! </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land </t><t>and have no knowledge.’” </t>
Jeremiah 14-19 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> Have you utterly rejected Judah? </t><t>Does your soul loathe Zion? </t><t>Why have you struck us down </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>so that there is no healing for us? </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>We looked for peace, but no good came; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>for a time of healing, but behold, terror.</t>
Jeremiah 14-20 <t><f>ⓟ</f> We acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD, </t><t>and the iniquity of our fathers, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>for we have sinned against you.</t>
Jeremiah 14-21 <t>Do not spurn us, <f>ⓡ</f>for your name's sake; </t><t>do not dishonor your glorious throne; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>remember and do not break your covenant with us.</t>
Jeremiah 14-22 <t>Are there any among <f>ⓣ</f>the false gods of the nations <f>ⓤ</f>that can bring rain? </t><t>Or can the heavens give showers? </t><t>Are you not he, O LORD our God? </t><t>We set our hope on you, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>for you do all these things. </t>
1 Timothy 6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Let all who are under a yoke as bondservants <f>[1]</f> regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, <f>ⓑ</f>so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled.
1 Timothy 6-2 Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are <f>ⓒ</f>brothers; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved. <pb/><e>False Teachers and True Contentment</e> </pb> <pb/><f>ⓓ</f>Teach and urge these things.
1 Timothy 6-3 If anyone <f>ⓔ</f>teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with <f>ⓕ</f>the sound <f>[2]</f> words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching <f>ⓖ</f>that accords with godliness,
1 Timothy 6-4 <f>ⓗ</f> he is puffed up with conceit and <f>ⓘ</f>understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for <f>ⓙ</f>controversy and for <f>ⓚ</f>quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions,
1 Timothy 6-5 and constant friction among people <f>ⓛ</f>who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, <f>ⓜ</f>imagining that godliness is a means of gain.
1 Timothy 6-6 But <f>ⓝ</f>godliness <f>ⓞ</f>with contentment is great gain,
1 Timothy 6-7 for <f>ⓟ</f>we brought nothing into the world, and <f>[3]</f> we cannot take anything out of the world.
1 Timothy 6-8 But <f>ⓠ</f>if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.
1 Timothy 6-9 But <f>ⓡ</f>those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, <f>ⓢ</f>into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that <f>ⓣ</f>plunge people into ruin and destruction.
1 Timothy 6-10 For the love of money is a root of <f>ⓤ</f>all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.
1 Timothy 6-11 <pb/>But as for you, <f>ⓥ</f>O man of God, <f>ⓦ</f>flee these things. <f>ⓧ</f>Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.
1 Timothy 6-12 <f>ⓨ</f> Fight the good fight of the faith. <f>ⓩ</f>Take hold of the eternal life <f>ⓐ</f>to which you were called and about which you made <f>ⓑ</f>the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
1 Timothy 6-13 <f>ⓒ</f> I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, <f>ⓓ</f>who in his testimony before <f>[4]</f> Pontius Pilate made <f>ⓔ</f>the good confession,
1 Timothy 6-14 to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until <f>ⓕ</f>the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Timothy 6-15 which he will display <f>ⓖ</f>at the proper time — he who is <f>ⓗ</f>the blessed and only Sovereign, <f>ⓘ</f>the King of kings and Lord of lords,
1 Timothy 6-16 <f>ⓙ</f> who alone has immortality, <f>ⓚ</f>who dwells in <f>ⓛ</f>unapproachable light, <f>ⓜ</f>whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.
1 Timothy 6-17 <pb/>As for the rich in <f>ⓝ</f>this present age, charge them <f>ⓞ</f>not to be haughty, nor <f>ⓟ</f>to set their hopes on <f>ⓠ</f>the uncertainty of riches, but on God, <f>ⓡ</f>who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
1 Timothy 6-18 They are to do good, <f>ⓢ</f>to be rich in good works, to be generous and <f>ⓣ</f>ready to share,
1 Timothy 6-19 thus <f>ⓤ</f>storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may <f>ⓥ</f>take hold of <f>ⓦ</f>that which is truly life.
1 Timothy 6-20 <pb/>O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you. <f>ⓧ</f>Avoid the <f>ⓨ</f>irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called “knowledge,”
1 Timothy 6-21 for by professing it some have swerved from the faith. <pb/><f>ⓩ</f>Grace be with you. <f>[5]</f>
