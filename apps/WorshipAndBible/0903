4-1 <pb/>When all the nation had finished passing <f>ⓐ</f>over the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,
4-2 <f>ⓑ</f> “Take twelve men from the people, from each tribe a man,
4-3 and command them, saying, ‘Take <f>ⓒ</f>twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place <f>ⓓ</f>where the priests' feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you and lay them down in <f>ⓔ</f>the place where you lodge tonight.’”
4-4 Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel, whom he had appointed, a man from each tribe.
4-5 And Joshua said to them, “Pass on before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel,
4-6 that this may be a sign among you. <f>ⓕ</f>When your children ask in time to come, ‘What do those stones mean to you?’
4-7 then you shall tell them that <f>ⓖ</f>the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the people of Israel <f>ⓗ</f>a memorial forever.”
4-8 <pb/>And the people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, just as the LORD told Joshua. And they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down <f>[1]</f> there.
4-9 And Joshua set up <f>[2]</f> twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, <f>ⓘ</f>in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day.
4-10 For the priests bearing the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. <pb/>The people passed over in haste.
4-11 And when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the LORD and the priests passed over before the people.
4-12 The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh <f>ⓙ</f>passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had told them.
4-13 About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the LORD for battle, to the plains of Jericho.
4-14 On that day the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they stood in awe of him just as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.
4-15 <pb/>And the LORD said to Joshua,
4-16 “Command the priests bearing <f>ⓛ</f>the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan.”
4-17 So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.”
4-18 And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, <f>ⓜ</f>as before.
4-19 <pb/>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped at <f>ⓝ</f>Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.
4-20 And <f>ⓞ</f>those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.
4-21 And he said to the people of Israel, <f>ⓟ</f>“When your children ask their fathers in times to come, ‘What do these stones mean?’
4-22 then you shall let your children know, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.’
4-23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, <f>ⓡ</f>which he dried up for us until we passed over,
4-24 <f>ⓢ</f> so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is <f>ⓣ</f>mighty, that you may <f>ⓤ</f>fear the LORD your God forever.” <f>[3]</f>
78-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; </t><t>incline your ears to the words of my mouth!</t>
78-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> I will open my mouth <f>ⓓ</f>in a parable; </t><t>I will utter dark sayings from of old,</t>
78-3 <t>things that we have heard and known, </t><t>that our <f>ⓔ</f>fathers have told us.</t>
78-4 <t>We will not <f>ⓕ</f>hide them from their children, </t><t>but <f>ⓖ</f>tell to the coming generation </t><t>the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>the wonders that he has done. </t>
78-5 <pb/><t>He established <f>ⓘ</f>a testimony in <f>ⓙ</f>Jacob </t><t>and appointed a law in <f>ⓚ</f>Israel, </t><t>which he commanded our fathers </t><t>to teach to their children,</t>
78-6 <t>that <f>ⓛ</f>the next generation might know them, </t><t>the children yet unborn, </t><t>and arise and tell them to their children,</t>
78-7 <t>so that they should set their hope in God </t><t>and not forget <f>ⓜ</f>the works of God, </t><t>but <f>ⓝ</f>keep his commandments;</t>
78-8 <t>and that they should not be <f>ⓞ</f>like their fathers, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>a stubborn and rebellious generation, </t><t>a generation <f>ⓠ</f>whose heart was not steadfast, </t><t>whose spirit was not faithful to God. </t>
78-9 <pb/><t>The Ephraimites, armed with <f>[2]</f> the bow, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>turned back on the day of battle.</t>
78-10 <t>They <f>ⓢ</f>did not keep God's covenant, </t><t>but refused to walk according to his law.</t>
78-11 <t>They <f>ⓣ</f>forgot his works </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>the wonders that he had shown them.</t>
78-12 <t>In the sight of their fathers <f>ⓥ</f>he performed wonders </t><t>in the land of Egypt, in <f>ⓦ</f>the fields of Zoan.</t>
78-13 <t>He <f>ⓧ</f>divided the sea and let them pass through it, </t><t>and made the waters <f>ⓨ</f>stand like a heap.</t>
78-14 <t><f>ⓩ</f> In the daytime he led them with a cloud, </t><t>and all the night with a fiery light.</t>
78-15 <t>He <f>ⓐ</f>split rocks in the wilderness </t><t>and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.</t>
78-16 <t>He made streams come out of <f>ⓑ</f>the rock </t><t>and caused waters to flow down like rivers. </t>
78-17 <pb/><t>Yet they sinned still more against him, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>rebelling against the Most High in the desert.</t>
78-18 <t>They <f>ⓓ</f>tested God in their heart </t><t>by demanding the food they craved.</t>
78-19 <t>They spoke against God, saying, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>“Can God <f>ⓕ</f>spread a table in the wilderness?</t>
78-20 <t><f>ⓖ</f> He struck the rock so that water gushed out </t><t>and streams overflowed. </t><t>Can he also give bread </t><t>or provide meat for his people?” </t>
78-21 <pb/><t>Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>a fire was kindled against Jacob; </t><t>his anger rose against Israel,</t>
78-22 <t>because they <f>ⓘ</f>did not believe in God </t><t>and did not trust his saving power.</t>
78-23 <t>Yet he commanded the skies above </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>opened the doors of heaven,</t>
78-24 <t>and he <f>ⓚ</f>rained down on them manna to eat </t><t>and gave them <f>ⓛ</f>the grain of heaven.</t>
78-25 <t>Man ate of the bread of <f>ⓜ</f>the angels; </t><t>he sent them food <f>ⓝ</f>in abundance.</t>
78-26 <t>He <f>ⓞ</f>caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, </t><t>and by his power he led out the south wind;</t>
78-27 <t>he rained meat on them like <f>ⓟ</f>dust, </t><t>winged birds like <f>ⓠ</f>the sand of the seas;</t>
78-28 <t>he <f>ⓡ</f>let them fall in the midst of their camp, </t><t>all around their dwellings.</t>
78-29 <t>And they <f>ⓢ</f>ate and were well filled, </t><t>for he gave them what they <f>ⓣ</f>craved.</t>
78-30 <t>But before they had satisfied their craving, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>while the food was still in their mouths,</t>
78-31 <t>the anger of God rose against them, </t><t>and he killed <f>ⓥ</f>the strongest of them </t><t>and laid low <f>ⓦ</f>the young men of Israel. </t>
78-32 <pb/><t>In spite of all this, they <f>ⓧ</f>still sinned; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>despite his wonders, they did not believe.</t>
78-33 <t>So he made <f>ⓩ</f>their days <f>ⓐ</f>vanish like <f>[3]</f> a breath, <f>[4]</f> </t><t>and their years in terror.</t>
78-34 <t>When he killed them, they <f>ⓑ</f>sought him; </t><t>they repented and sought God earnestly.</t>
78-35 <t>They remembered that God was their <f>ⓒ</f>rock, </t><t>the Most High God their <f>ⓓ</f>redeemer.</t>
78-36 <t>But they <f>ⓔ</f>flattered him with their mouths; </t><t>they <f>ⓕ</f>lied to him with their tongues.</t>
78-37 <t>Their <f>ⓖ</f>heart was not <f>ⓗ</f>steadfast toward him; </t><t>they were not faithful to his covenant.</t>
78-38 <t>Yet he, being <f>ⓘ</f>compassionate, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>atoned for their iniquity </t><t>and did not destroy them; </t><t>he restrained his anger often </t><t>and did not stir up all his wrath.</t>
78-39 <t>He <f>ⓚ</f>remembered that they were but <f>ⓛ</f>flesh, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>a wind that passes and comes not again.</t>
78-40 <t>How often they <f>ⓝ</f>rebelled against him in the wilderness </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>grieved him in <f>ⓟ</f>the desert!</t>
78-41 <t>They <f>ⓠ</f>tested God again and again </t><t>and provoked <f>ⓡ</f>the Holy One of Israel.</t>
78-42 <t>They <f>ⓢ</f>did not remember his power <f>[5]</f> </t><t>or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,</t>
78-43 <t><f>ⓣ</f> when he performed his <f>ⓤ</f>signs in Egypt </t><t>and his <f>ⓥ</f>marvels in <f>ⓦ</f>the fields of Zoan.</t>
78-44 <t>He <f>ⓧ</f>turned their rivers to blood, </t><t>so that they could not drink of their streams.</t>
78-45 <t>He sent among them swarms of <f>ⓨ</f>flies, which devoured them, </t><t>and <f>ⓩ</f>frogs, which destroyed them.</t>
78-46 <t>He gave their crops to <f>ⓐ</f>the destroying locust </t><t>and the fruit of their labor to the locust.</t>
78-47 <t>He destroyed their vines with <f>ⓑ</f>hail </t><t>and their sycamores with frost.</t>
78-48 <t>He gave over their <f>ⓒ</f>cattle to the hail </t><t>and their flocks to thunderbolts.</t>
78-49 <t>He let loose on them his burning anger, </t><t>wrath, indignation, and distress, </t><t>a company of <f>ⓓ</f>destroying angels.</t>
78-50 <t>He made a path for his anger; </t><t>he did not spare them from death, </t><t>but gave their lives over to the plague.</t>
78-51 <t>He struck down every <f>ⓔ</f>firstborn in Egypt, </t><t>the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of <f>ⓕ</f>Ham.</t>
78-52 <t>Then he led out his people <f>ⓖ</f>like sheep </t><t>and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</t>
78-53 <t><f>ⓗ</f> He led them in safety, so that they <f>ⓘ</f>were not afraid, </t><t>but <f>ⓙ</f>the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</t>
78-54 <t>And he brought them to his <f>ⓚ</f>holy land, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>to the mountain which his right hand had <f>ⓜ</f>won.</t>
78-55 <t>He <f>ⓝ</f>drove out nations before them; </t><t>he <f>ⓞ</f>apportioned them for a possession </t><t>and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. </t>
78-56 <pb/><t>Yet they <f>ⓟ</f>tested and <f>ⓠ</f>rebelled against the Most High God </t><t>and did not keep his testimonies,</t>
78-57 <t>but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; </t><t>they twisted like <f>ⓡ</f>a deceitful bow.</t>
78-58 <t>For they <f>ⓢ</f>provoked him to anger with their <f>ⓣ</f>high places; </t><t>they <f>ⓤ</f>moved him to jealousy with their <f>ⓥ</f>idols.</t>
78-59 <t>When God heard, he was full of <f>ⓦ</f>wrath, </t><t>and he utterly rejected Israel.</t>
78-60 <t>He <f>ⓧ</f>forsook his dwelling at <f>ⓨ</f>Shiloh, </t><t>the tent where he dwelt among mankind,</t>
78-61 <t>and delivered his <f>ⓩ</f>power to captivity, </t><t>his <f>ⓐ</f>glory to the hand of the foe.</t>
78-62 <t>He <f>ⓑ</f>gave his people over to the sword </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>vented his wrath on his heritage.</t>
78-63 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Fire devoured their young men, </t><t>and their young women had no <f>ⓔ</f>marriage song.</t>
78-64 <t>Their <f>ⓕ</f>priests fell by the sword, </t><t>and their <f>ⓖ</f>widows made no lamentation.</t>
78-65 <t>Then the Lord <f>ⓗ</f>awoke as from sleep, </t><t>like a strong man shouting because of wine.</t>
78-66 <t>And he <f>ⓘ</f>put his adversaries to rout; </t><t>he put them to everlasting shame. </t>
78-67 <pb/><t>He rejected the tent of <f>ⓙ</f>Joseph; </t><t>he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</t>
78-68 <t>but he chose the tribe of Judah, </t><t>Mount Zion, which he <f>ⓚ</f>loves.</t>
78-69 <t>He <f>ⓛ</f>built his sanctuary like the high heavens, </t><t>like the earth, which he has founded forever.</t>
78-70 <t>He <f>ⓜ</f>chose David his servant </t><t>and took him from the sheepfolds;</t>
78-71 <t>from <f>ⓝ</f>following the nursing ewes he brought him </t><t>to <f>ⓞ</f>shepherd Jacob his people, </t><t>Israel his <f>ⓟ</f>inheritance.</t>
