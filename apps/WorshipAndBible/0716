25-1 <pb/>While Israel lived in <f>ⓐ</f>Shittim, <f>ⓑ</f>the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab.
25-2 <f>ⓒ</f> These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
25-3 So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
25-4 And the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓓ</f>“Take all the chiefs of the people and <f>ⓔ</f>hang <f>[1]</f> them in the sun before the LORD, <f>ⓕ</f>that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.”
25-5 And Moses said to <f>ⓖ</f>the judges of Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>“Each of you kill those of his men who have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor.”
25-6 <pb/>And behold, one of the people of Israel came and brought a Midianite woman to his family, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole congregation of the people of Israel, while they were <f>ⓘ</f>weeping in the entrance of the tent of meeting.
25-7 <f>ⓙ</f> When Phinehas <f>ⓚ</f>the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose and left the congregation and took a spear in his hand
25-8 and went after the man of Israel into the chamber and pierced both of them, the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. Thus the plague on the people of Israel was stopped.
25-9 Nevertheless, <f>ⓛ</f>those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
25-10 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses,
25-11 “Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the people of Israel, in that he <f>ⓜ</f>was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the people of Israel in <f>ⓝ</f>my jealousy.
25-12 Therefore say, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace,
25-13 and it shall be to him and to <f>ⓟ</f>his descendants after him the covenant of <f>ⓠ</f>a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the people of Israel.’”
25-14 <pb/>The name of the slain man of Israel, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, chief of a father's house belonging to the Simeonites.
25-15 And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of <f>ⓡ</f>Zur, who was the tribal head of a father's house in Midian.
25-16 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
25-17 <f>ⓢ</f> “Harass the Midianites and strike them down,
25-18 for they have harassed you with their <f>ⓣ</f>wiles, with which they beguiled you in the matter of <f>ⓤ</f>Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the chief of Midian, their sister, who was killed on the day of the plague on account of Peor.”
29-1 <pb/><t>Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.</t>
29-2 <t>Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; </t><t>worship the LORD in <f>ⓑ</f>the splendor of holiness. <f>[2]</f> </t>
29-3 <pb/><t>The voice of the LORD is over <f>ⓒ</f>the waters; </t><t>the God of glory <f>ⓓ</f>thunders, </t><t>the LORD, over many waters.</t>
29-4 <t>The voice of the LORD is <f>ⓔ</f>powerful; </t><t>the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. </t>
29-5 <pb/><t>The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; </t><t>the LORD breaks <f>ⓕ</f>the cedars of Lebanon.</t>
29-6 <t>He makes Lebanon to <f>ⓖ</f>skip like a calf, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>Sirion like a young <f>ⓘ</f>wild ox. </t>
29-7 <pb/><t>The voice of the LORD flashes forth flames of fire.</t>
29-8 <t>The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; </t><t>the LORD shakes the wilderness of <f>ⓙ</f>Kadesh. </t>
29-9 <pb/><t>The voice of the LORD makes <f>ⓚ</f>the deer give birth <f>[3]</f> </t><t>and strips the forests bare, </t><t>and in his temple all cry, “Glory!” </t>
29-10 <pb/><t>The LORD sits enthroned over <f>ⓛ</f>the flood; </t><t>the LORD sits enthroned <f>ⓜ</f>as king forever.</t>
29-11 <t>May the LORD give <f>ⓝ</f>strength to his people! </t><t>May the LORD bless <f>[4]</f> his people with <f>ⓞ</f>peace! </t>
10-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Israel is a luxuriant vine </t><t>that yields its fruit. </t><t>The more his fruit increased, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>the more altars he built; </t><t>as his country improved, </t><t>he improved his pillars.</t>
10-2 <t>Their heart is false; </t><t>now they must bear their guilt. </t><t>The LORD <f>[1]</f> will break down their altars </t><t>and destroy their pillars. </t>
10-3 <pb/><t>For now they will say: </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>“We have no king, </t><t>for we do not fear the LORD; </t><t>and a king — what could he do for us?”</t>
10-4 <t>They utter <f>ⓓ</f>mere words; </t><t>with empty <f>[2]</f> oaths they make covenants; </t><t>so <f>ⓔ</f>judgment springs up like poisonous weeds </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>in the furrows of the field.</t>
10-5 <t>The inhabitants of Samaria tremble </t><t>for <f>ⓖ</f>the calf <f>[3]</f> of <f>ⓗ</f>Beth-aven. </t><t>Its people mourn for it, and so do its idolatrous priests — </t><t>those who rejoiced over it and <f>ⓘ</f>over its glory — </t><t>for it has departed <f>[4]</f> from them.</t>
10-6 <t><f>ⓙ</f> The thing itself shall be carried to Assyria </t><t>as tribute to <f>ⓚ</f>the great king. <f>[5]</f> </t><t>Ephraim shall be put to shame, </t><t>and Israel shall be ashamed <f>ⓛ</f>of his idol. <f>[6]</f> </t>
10-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> Samaria's king shall perish </t><t>like a twig on the face of the waters.</t>
10-8 <t>The high places of <f>ⓝ</f>Aven, <f>ⓞ</f>the sin of Israel, </t><t>shall be destroyed. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>Thorn and thistle shall grow up </t><t>on their altars, </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>they shall say to the mountains, “Cover us,” </t><t>and to the hills, “Fall on us.” </t>
10-9 <pb/><t>From <f>ⓡ</f>the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel; </t><t>there they have continued. </t><t>Shall not the war against the unjust <f>[7]</f> overtake them in Gibeah?</t>
10-10 <t><f>ⓢ</f> When I please, <f>ⓣ</f>I will discipline them, </t><t>and nations shall be gathered against them </t><t>when they are bound up for <f>ⓤ</f>their double iniquity. </t>
10-11 <pb/><t>Ephraim was a trained calf </t><t>that <f>ⓥ</f>loved to thresh, </t><t>and I spared her fair neck; </t><t>but I will put <f>ⓦ</f>Ephraim to the yoke; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>Judah must plow; </t><t>Jacob must harrow for himself.</t>
10-12 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Sow for yourselves righteousness; </t><t>reap steadfast love; </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>break up your fallow ground, </t><t>for it is the time to seek the LORD, </t><t>that he may come and <f>ⓐ</f>rain righteousness upon you. </t>
10-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> You have plowed iniquity; </t><t>you have reaped injustice; </t><t>you have eaten the fruit of lies. </t><t>Because you have trusted in your own way </t><t>and in the multitude of your warriors,</t>
10-14 <t>therefore <f>ⓒ</f>the tumult of war shall arise among your people, </t><t>and all your fortresses shall be destroyed, </t><t>as <f>ⓓ</f>Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.</t>
10-15 <t>Thus it shall be done to you, O <f>ⓕ</f>Bethel, </t><t>because of your great evil. </t><t>At dawn <f>ⓖ</f>the king of Israel </t><t>shall be utterly cut off. </t>
