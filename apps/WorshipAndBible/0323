Genesis 27-1 <pb/>When Isaac was old and <f>ⓐ</f>his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son”; and he answered, “Here I am.”
Genesis 27-2 He said, “Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.
Genesis 27-3 <f>ⓑ</f> Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me,
Genesis 27-4 and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul <f>ⓒ</f>may bless you before I die.”
Genesis 27-5 <pb/>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,
Genesis 27-6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,
Genesis 27-7 ‘Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.’
Genesis 27-8 Now therefore, my son, <f>ⓓ</f>obey my voice as I command you.
Genesis 27-9 Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves.
Genesis 27-10 And you shall bring it to your father to eat, <f>ⓔ</f>so that he may bless you before he dies.”
Genesis 27-11 But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, <f>ⓕ</f>my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
Genesis 27-12 Perhaps my father <f>ⓖ</f>will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring <f>ⓗ</f>a curse upon myself and not a blessing.”
Genesis 27-13 His mother said to him, <f>ⓘ</f>“Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.”
Genesis 27-14 <pb/>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved.
Genesis 27-15 Then Rebekah took the <f>ⓙ</f>best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
Genesis 27-16 And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
Genesis 27-17 And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
Genesis 27-18 <pb/>So he went in to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”
Genesis 27-19 Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.”
Genesis 27-20 But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Because the LORD your God granted me success.”
Genesis 27-21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I <f>ⓚ</f>may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.”
Genesis 27-22 So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
Genesis 27-23 And he did not recognize him, because <f>ⓛ</f>his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. <f>ⓜ</f>So he blessed him.
Genesis 27-24 He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.”
Genesis 27-25 Then he said, “Bring it near to me, <f>ⓝ</f>that I may eat of my son's game and bless you.” So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
Genesis 27-26 <pb/>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.”
Genesis 27-27 So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments <f>ⓞ</f>and blessed him and said, <pb/><t>“See, <f>ⓟ</f>the smell of my son </t><t>is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed!</t>
Genesis 27-28 <t>May God give you of <f>ⓠ</f>the dew of heaven </t><t>and of the fatness of the earth </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>plenty of grain and wine.</t>
Genesis 27-29 <t>Let peoples serve you, </t><t>and nations <f>ⓢ</f>bow down to you. </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>Be lord over your brothers, </t><t>and may your mother's sons bow down to you. </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>Cursed be everyone who curses you, </t><t>and blessed be everyone who blesses you!” </t>
Genesis 27-30 <pb/>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
Genesis 27-31 He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me.”
Genesis 27-32 His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”
Genesis 27-33 Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.”
Genesis 27-34 As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, <f>ⓥ</f>he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!”
Genesis 27-35 But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.”
Genesis 27-36 Esau said, <f>ⓦ</f>“Is he not rightly named Jacob? <f>[1]</f> For he has cheated me these two times. <f>ⓧ</f>He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”
Genesis 27-37 Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, <f>ⓨ</f>I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and <f>ⓩ</f>with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?”
Genesis 27-38 Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” And <f>ⓐ</f>Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
Genesis 27-39 <pb/>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: <pb/><t>“Behold, <f>ⓑ</f>away from <f>[2]</f> the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, </t><t>and away from <f>[3]</f> the dew of heaven on high.</t>
Genesis 27-40 <t>By your sword you shall live, </t><t>and you <f>ⓒ</f>shall serve your brother; </t><t>but when you grow restless </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>you shall break his yoke from your neck.” </t>
Genesis 27-41 <pb/>Now Esau <f>ⓔ</f>hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, <f>ⓕ</f>“The days of mourning for my father are approaching; <f>ⓖ</f>then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
Genesis 27-42 But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.
Genesis 27-43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran
Genesis 27-44 and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away —
Genesis 27-45 until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?”
Genesis 27-46 <pb/>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, <f>ⓗ</f>“I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?”
2 Chronicles 25-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 25-2 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>yet not with a whole heart.
2 Chronicles 25-3 And as soon as the royal power was firmly his, he killed his servants who had struck down the king his father.
2 Chronicles 25-4 But he did not put their children to death, according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, <f>ⓒ</f>“Fathers shall not die because of their children, nor children die because of their fathers, but each one shall die for his own sin.”
2 Chronicles 25-5 <pb/>Then Amaziah assembled the men of Judah and set them by fathers' houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He mustered those <f>ⓓ</f>twenty years old and upward, and found that they were <f>ⓔ</f>300,000 choice men, fit for war, <f>ⓕ</f>able to handle spear and shield.
2 Chronicles 25-6 He hired also 100,000 mighty men of valor from Israel for 100 talents <f>[1]</f> of silver.
2 Chronicles 25-7 But <f>ⓖ</f>a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel, with all these Ephraimites.
2 Chronicles 25-8 But go, act, be strong for the battle. Why should you suppose that God will cast you down before the enemy? <f>ⓗ</f>For God has power to help or to cast down.”
2 Chronicles 25-9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do about the hundred talents that I have given to the army of Israel?” The man of God answered, “The LORD is able to give you much more than this.”
2 Chronicles 25-10 Then Amaziah discharged the army that had come to him from Ephraim to go home again. And they became very angry with Judah and returned home in fierce anger.
2 Chronicles 25-11 But Amaziah took courage and led out his people and went to the <f>ⓘ</f>Valley of Salt and struck down <f>ⓙ</f>10,000 men of Seir.
2 Chronicles 25-12 The men of Judah captured another 10,000 alive and took them to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock, and they were all dashed to pieces.
2 Chronicles 25-13 But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, not letting them go with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah, <f>ⓚ</f>from Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck down 3,000 people in them and took much spoil.
2 Chronicles 25-14 <pb/>After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites, <f>ⓛ</f>he brought the gods <f>ⓜ</f>of the men of Seir and set them up as his gods and worshiped them, making offerings to them.
2 Chronicles 25-15 Therefore the LORD was angry with Amaziah and sent to him a prophet, who said to him, “Why have you sought the gods of a people <f>ⓝ</f>who did not deliver their own people from your hand?”
2 Chronicles 25-16 But as he was speaking, the king said to him, “Have we made you a royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” So the prophet stopped, but said, “I know that <f>ⓞ</f>God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.”
2 Chronicles 25-17 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”
2 Chronicles 25-18 And Joash the king of Israel sent word to Amaziah king of Judah, <f>ⓠ</f>“A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife,’ and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle.
2 Chronicles 25-19 You say, ‘See, I <f>[2]</f> have struck down Edom,’ and <f>ⓡ</f>your heart has lifted you up in boastfulness. But now stay at home. Why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?”
2 Chronicles 25-20 <pb/>But Amaziah would not listen, for it was of God, in order that he might give them into the hand of their enemies, <f>ⓢ</f>because they had sought the gods of Edom.
2 Chronicles 25-21 So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
2 Chronicles 25-22 And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
2 Chronicles 25-23 And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, son of <f>ⓣ</f>Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for 400 cubits, <f>[3]</f> from <f>ⓤ</f>the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate.
2 Chronicles 25-24 And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God, in the care of <f>ⓥ</f>Obed-edom. He seized also the treasuries of the king's house, also hostages, and he returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles 25-25 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
2 Chronicles 25-26 Now the rest of the deeds of Amaziah, from first to last, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
2 Chronicles 25-27 From the time when he turned away from the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish and put him to death there.
2 Chronicles 25-28 And they brought him upon horses, and he was buried with his fathers in the city of David. <f>[4]</f>

Jeremiah 12-14 <pb/>Thus says the LORD concerning all <f>ⓒ</f>my evil neighbors <f>ⓓ</f>who touch the heritage that <f>ⓔ</f>I have given my people Israel to inherit: “Behold, I will pluck them up from their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
Jeremiah 12-15 And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, <f>ⓕ</f>and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land.

1 Timothy 4-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>the Spirit expressly says that <f>ⓑ</f>in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to <f>ⓒ</f>deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,
1 Timothy 4-2 through the insincerity of <f>ⓓ</f>liars whose consciences are seared,
1 Timothy 4-3 <f>ⓔ</f> who forbid marriage and <f>ⓕ</f>require abstinence from foods <f>ⓖ</f>that God created <f>ⓗ</f>to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy 4-4 For <f>ⓘ</f>everything created by God is good, and <f>ⓙ</f>nothing is to be rejected if it is <f>ⓚ</f>received with thanksgiving,
