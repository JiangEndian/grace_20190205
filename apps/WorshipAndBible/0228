4-1 <pb/>Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten <f>[1]</f> a man with the help of the LORD.”
4-2 And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.
4-3 In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of <f>ⓐ</f>the fruit of the ground,
4-4 and Abel also brought of <f>ⓑ</f>the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>had regard for Abel and his offering,
4-5 but <f>ⓓ</f>for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.
4-6 The LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?
4-7 <f>ⓔ</f> If you do well, will you not be accepted? <f>[2]</f> And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. <f>ⓕ</f>Its desire is contrary to <f>[3]</f> you, but you must rule over it.”
4-8 <pb/>Cain spoke to Abel his brother. <f>[4]</f> And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and <f>ⓖ</f>killed him.
4-9 Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, <f>ⓗ</f>“I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?”
4-10 And the LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood <f>ⓘ</f>is crying to me from the ground.
4-11 And now <f>ⓙ</f>you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
4-12 When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
4-13 Cain said to the LORD, “My <f>ⓚ</f>punishment is greater than I can bear. <f>[5]</f>
4-14 Behold, <f>ⓛ</f>you have driven me today away from the ground, and <f>ⓜ</f>from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, <f>ⓝ</f>and whoever finds me will kill me.”
4-15 Then the LORD said to him, “Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him <f>ⓞ</f>sevenfold.” And the LORD <f>ⓟ</f>put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him.
4-16 Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, <f>[6]</f> east of Eden.
4-17 <pb/>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
4-18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
4-19 And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
4-20 Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
4-21 His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
4-22 Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
4-23 <pb/>Lamech said to his wives: <pb/><t>“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; </t><t>you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: </t><t>I have killed a man for wounding me, </t><t>a young man for striking me.</t>
4-24 <t><f>ⓠ</f> If Cain's revenge is sevenfold, </t><t>then Lamech's is seventy-sevenfold.” </t>
4-25 <pb/>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, “God has appointed <f>[7]</f> for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”
4-26 To <f>ⓡ</f>Seth also a son was born, and he called his name <f>ⓢ</f>Enosh. At that time people began <f>ⓣ</f>to call upon the name of the LORD.
2-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>Now Solomon purposed to build a temple for the name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.
2-2 <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>And Solomon assigned 70,000 men to bear burdens and 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and <f>ⓒ</f>3,600 to oversee them.
2-3 <f>ⓓ</f> And Solomon sent word to Hiram the king of Tyre: <f>ⓔ</f>“As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me.
2-4 Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God and dedicate it to him for the burning of <f>ⓕ</f>incense of sweet spices before him, and for <f>ⓖ</f>the regular arrangement of the showbread, and for <f>ⓗ</f>burnt offerings morning and evening, <f>ⓘ</f>on the Sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, as ordained forever for Israel.
2-5 The house that I am to build will be great, <f>ⓙ</f>for our God is greater than all gods.
2-6 <f>ⓚ</f> But who is able to build him a house, since <f>ⓛ</f>heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him?
2-7 So now <f>ⓜ</f>send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, <f>ⓝ</f>whom David my father provided.
2-8 Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that <f>ⓞ</f>your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants,
2-9 to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful.
2-10 <f>ⓟ</f> I will give for your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, 20,000 cors <f>[3]</f> of crushed wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths <f>[4]</f> of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil.”
2-11 <pb/>Then Hiram the king of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon, <f>ⓠ</f>“Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you king over them.”
2-12 Hiram also said, “Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, <f>ⓡ</f>who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, who has discretion and understanding, <f>ⓢ</f>who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
2-13 <pb/>“Now I have sent a skilled man, who has understanding, Huram-abi,
2-14 <f>ⓣ</f> the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is <f>ⓤ</f>trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father.
2-15 Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, <f>ⓥ</f>of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants.
2-16 <f>ⓦ</f> And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you in rafts by sea to <f>ⓧ</f>Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem.”
2-17 <pb/>Then Solomon counted all the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, <f>ⓨ</f>after the census of them that David his father had taken, and there were found 153,600.
2-18 <f>ⓩ</f> Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 as overseers to make the people work.
55-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> “Come, everyone who thirsts, </t><t>come to the waters; </t><t>and he who has no money, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>come, buy and eat! </t><t>Come, buy wine and milk </t><t>without money and without price.</t>
55-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, </t><t>and your labor for that which does not satisfy? </t><t>Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good, </t><t>and delight yourselves in rich food.</t>
55-3 <t>Incline your ear, and come to me; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>hear, that your soul may live; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>my steadfast, sure love for <f>ⓖ</f>David.</t>
55-4 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>a leader and commander for the peoples.</t>
55-5 <t><f>ⓙ</f> Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know, </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>a nation that did not know you shall run to you, </t><t>because of the LORD your God, and of the Holy One of Israel, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>for he has glorified you. </t>
55-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> “Seek the LORD while he may be found; </t><t>call upon him while he is near;</t>
55-7 <t>let the wicked forsake his way, </t><t>and the unrighteous man his thoughts; </t><t>let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him, </t><t>and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</t>
55-8 <t>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, </t><t>neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.</t>
55-9 <t><f>ⓝ</f> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, </t><t>so are my ways higher than your ways </t><t>and my thoughts than your thoughts. </t>
55-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven </t><t>and do not return there but water the earth, </t><t>making it bring forth and sprout, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,</t>
55-11 <t>so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; </t><t>it shall not return to me empty, </t><t>but <f>ⓠ</f>it shall accomplish that which I purpose, </t><t>and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it. </t>
55-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f> “For you shall go out in joy </t><t>and be led forth in peace; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>the mountains and the hills before you </t><t>shall break forth into singing, </t><t>and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.</t>
55-13 <t><f>ⓣ</f> Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress; </t><t>instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle; </t><t>and it shall make a name for the LORD, </t><t>an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.” </t>
2-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And you were <f>ⓑ</f>dead in the trespasses and sins
2-2 <f>ⓒ</f> in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following <f>ⓓ</f>the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in <f>ⓔ</f>the sons of disobedience —
2-3 among whom we all once lived in <f>ⓕ</f>the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body <f>[1]</f> and the mind, and <f>ⓖ</f>were by nature <f>ⓗ</f>children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. <f>[2]</f>
2-4 But <f>[3]</f> God, being <f>ⓘ</f>rich in mercy, <f>ⓙ</f>because of the great love with which he loved us,
2-5 even <f>ⓚ</f>when we were dead in our trespasses, <f>ⓛ</f>made us alive together with Christ — <f>ⓜ</f>by grace you have been saved —
2-6 and raised us up with him and <f>ⓝ</f>seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
2-7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable <f>ⓞ</f>riches of his grace in <f>ⓟ</f>kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
2-8 For <f>ⓠ</f>by grace you have been saved <f>ⓡ</f>through faith. And this is <f>ⓢ</f>not your own doing; <f>ⓣ</f>it is the gift of God,
2-9 <f>ⓤ</f> not a result of works, <f>ⓥ</f>so that no one may boast.
2-10 For <f>ⓦ</f>we are his workmanship, <f>ⓧ</f>created in Christ Jesus <f>ⓨ</f>for good works, <f>ⓩ</f>which God prepared beforehand, <f>ⓐ</f>that we should walk in them.
2-11 <pb/>Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called <f>ⓑ</f>the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands —
2-12 remember <f>ⓒ</f>that you were at that time separated from Christ, <f>ⓓ</f>alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to <f>ⓔ</f>the covenants of promise, <f>ⓕ</f>having no hope and without God in the world.
2-13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were <f>ⓖ</f>far off have been brought near <f>ⓗ</f>by the blood of Christ.
2-14 For <f>ⓘ</f>he himself is our peace, <f>ⓙ</f>who has made us both one and has broken down <f>ⓚ</f>in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
2-15 by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in <f>ⓛ</f>ordinances, that he might create in himself one <f>ⓜ</f>new man in place of the two, so making peace,
2-16 and might <f>ⓝ</f>reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
2-17 And he came and <f>ⓞ</f>preached peace to you who were <f>ⓟ</f>far off and peace to those who were <f>ⓠ</f>near.
2-18 For <f>ⓡ</f>through him we both have <f>ⓢ</f>access in <f>ⓣ</f>one Spirit to the Father.
2-19 So then you are no longer <f>ⓤ</f>strangers and aliens, <f>[4]</f> but you are <f>ⓥ</f>fellow citizens with the saints and <f>ⓦ</f>members of the household of God,
2-20 <f>ⓧ</f> built on the foundation of the <f>ⓨ</f>apostles and prophets, <f>ⓩ</f>Christ Jesus himself being <f>ⓐ</f>the cornerstone,
2-21 <f>ⓑ</f> in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into <f>ⓒ</f>a holy temple in the Lord.
2-22 In him <f>ⓓ</f>you also are being built together <f>ⓔ</f>into a dwelling place for God by <f>[5]</f> the Spirit.
