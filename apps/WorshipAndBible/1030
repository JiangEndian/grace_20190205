12-1 <pb/>And Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have obeyed <f>ⓐ</f>your voice in all that you have said to me <f>ⓑ</f>and have made a king over you.
12-2 And now, behold, the king <f>ⓒ</f>walks before you, <f>ⓓ</f>and I am old and gray; and behold, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day.
12-3 Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and before <f>ⓔ</f>his anointed. <f>ⓕ</f>Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me <f>[1]</f> and I will restore it to you.”
12-4 They said, “You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand.”
12-5 And he said to them, “The LORD is witness against you, and <f>ⓖ</f>his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything <f>ⓗ</f>in my hand.” And they said, “He is witness.”
12-6 <pb/>And Samuel said to the people, <f>ⓘ</f>“The LORD is witness, <f>[2]</f> who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
12-7 Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous deeds of the LORD that he performed for you and for your fathers.
12-8 <f>ⓙ</f> When Jacob went into Egypt, and the Egyptians oppressed them, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>then your fathers cried out to the LORD and <f>ⓛ</f>the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, <f>ⓜ</f>who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place.
12-9 But <f>ⓝ</f>they forgot the LORD their God. <f>ⓞ</f>And he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>and into the hand of the Philistines, <f>ⓠ</f>and into the hand of the king of Moab. And they fought against them.
12-10 <f>ⓡ</f> And they cried out to the LORD and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD <f>ⓢ</f>and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. But now <f>ⓣ</f>deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, that we may serve you.’
12-11 And the LORD sent <f>ⓤ</f>Jerubbaal <f>ⓥ</f>and Barak <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓦ</f>and Jephthah and <f>ⓧ</f>Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety.
12-12 And when you saw that <f>ⓨ</f>Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, <f>ⓩ</f>you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ <f>ⓐ</f>when the LORD your God was your king.
12-13 And now <f>ⓑ</f>behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, <f>ⓒ</f>the LORD has set a king over you.
12-14 If you will <f>ⓓ</f>fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God, it will be well.
12-15 But <f>ⓔ</f>if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then <f>ⓕ</f>the hand of the LORD will be against you and <f>ⓖ</f>your king. <f>[6]</f>
12-16 Now therefore <f>ⓗ</f>stand still and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes.
12-17 <f>ⓘ</f> Is it not wheat harvest today? <f>ⓙ</f>I will call upon the LORD, that he may send thunder and rain. And you shall know and see that <f>ⓚ</f>your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking for yourselves a king.”
12-18 So Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day, <f>ⓛ</f>and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
12-19 <pb/>And all the people said to Samuel, <f>ⓜ</f>“Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.”
12-20 And Samuel said to the people, “Do not be afraid; you have done all this evil. Yet <f>ⓝ</f>do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
12-21 And <f>ⓞ</f>do not turn aside after <f>ⓟ</f>empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are empty.
12-22 <f>ⓠ</f> For the LORD will not forsake his people, <f>ⓡ</f>for his great name's sake, because <f>ⓢ</f>it has pleased the LORD to make you a people for himself.
12-23 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing <f>ⓣ</f>to pray for you, <f>ⓤ</f>and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
12-24 <f>ⓥ</f> Only fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider <f>ⓦ</f>what great things he has done for you.
12-25 But if you still do wickedly, <f>ⓧ</f>you shall be swept away, <f>ⓨ</f>both you and your king.”

5-1 <pb/>On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by <f>ⓐ</f>the lake of Gennesaret,
5-2 <f>ⓑ</f> and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were <f>ⓒ</f>washing their nets.
5-3 Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And <f>ⓓ</f>he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
5-4 And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”</J>
5-5 And Simon answered, “Master, <f>ⓕ</f>we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.”
5-6 And when they had done this, <f>ⓖ</f>they enclosed a large number of fish, and <f>ⓗ</f>their nets were breaking.
5-7 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. <f>ⓘ</f>And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
5-8 But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>“Depart from me, for <f>ⓚ</f>I am a sinful man, O Lord.”
5-9 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,
5-10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <J>“Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.” <f>[1]</f></J>
5-11 And when they had brought their boats to land, <f>ⓛ</f>they left everything and followed him.
5-12 <pb/>While he was in one of the cities, <f>ⓜ</f>there came a man full of leprosy. <f>[2]</f> And when he saw Jesus, he <f>ⓝ</f>fell on his face and begged him, “Lord, <f>ⓞ</f>if you will, you can make me clean.”
5-13 And Jesus <f>[3]</f> stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <J>“I will; be clean.”</J> And immediately the leprosy left him.
5-14 And he charged him <f>ⓟ</f>to tell no one, but <J>“go and show <f>ⓠ</f>yourself to the priest, and <f>ⓡ</f>make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, <f>ⓢ</f>for a proof to them.”</J>
5-15 <f>ⓣ</f> But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities.
5-16 But <f>ⓤ</f>he would withdraw to desolate places and <f>ⓥ</f>pray.
5-17 <pb/>On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and <f>ⓦ</f>teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And <f>ⓧ</f>the power of the Lord was with him to heal. <f>[4]</f>
5-18 <f>ⓨ</f> And behold, some men were bringing <f>ⓩ</f>on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus,
5-19 but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on <f>ⓐ</f>the roof and let him down with his bed <f>ⓑ</f>through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.
5-20 And <f>ⓒ</f>when he saw their faith, he said, <J>“Man, <f>ⓓ</f>your sins are forgiven you.”</J>
5-21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, “Who is this who speaks <f>ⓔ</f>blasphemies? <f>ⓕ</f>Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
5-22 When Jesus <f>ⓖ</f>perceived their thoughts, he answered them, <J>“Why do you question in your hearts?</J>
5-23 <J>Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?</J>
5-24 <J>But that you may know that <f>ⓗ</f>the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</J> — he said to the man who was paralyzed — <J>“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.”</J>
5-25 And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, <f>ⓘ</f>glorifying God.
5-26 And amazement seized them all, and they <f>ⓙ</f>glorified God and were filled <f>ⓚ</f>with awe, saying, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”
5-27 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> After this he went out and saw <f>ⓜ</f>a tax collector named <f>ⓝ</f>Levi, sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him, <J>“Follow me.”</J>
5-28 And <f>ⓞ</f>leaving everything, he rose and followed him.
5-29 <pb/>And Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large company <f>ⓟ</f>of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them.
5-30 And the Pharisees and <f>ⓠ</f>their scribes grumbled at his disciples, saying, <f>ⓡ</f>“Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
5-31 And Jesus answered them, <J>“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</J>
5-32 <J><f>ⓢ</f> I have not come to call the righteous <f>ⓣ</f>but sinners <f>ⓤ</f>to repentance.”</J>
5-33 <pb/>And they said to him, <f>ⓥ</f>“The disciples of John <f>ⓦ</f>fast often and <f>ⓧ</f>offer prayers, <f>ⓨ</f>and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.”
5-34 And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓩ</f>“Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?</J>
5-35 <J><f>ⓐ</f> The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and <f>ⓑ</f>then they will fast in those days.”</J>
5-36 He also told them a parable: <J>“No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</J>
5-37 <J>And no one puts new wine into old <f>ⓒ</f>wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.</J>
5-38 <J>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</J>
5-39 <J>And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, ‘The old is good.’” <f>[5]</f></J>
