Exodus 38-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood. Five cubits <f>[1]</f> was its length, and five cubits its breadth. It was square, and three cubits was its height.
Exodus 38-2 He made horns for it on its four corners. Its horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze.
Exodus 38-3 And he made all the utensils of the altar, the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the fire pans. He made all its utensils of bronze.
Exodus 38-4 And he made for the altar a grating, a network of bronze, under its ledge, extending halfway down.
Exodus 38-5 He cast four rings on the four corners of the bronze grating as holders for the poles.
Exodus 38-6 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
Exodus 38-7 And he put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it with them. He made it hollow, with boards.
Exodus 38-8 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> He made the basin of bronze and its stand of bronze, from the mirrors of the <f>ⓒ</f>ministering women who ministered in the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Exodus 38-9 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> And he made the court. For the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits;
Exodus 38-10 their twenty pillars and their twenty bases were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
Exodus 38-11 And for the north side there were hangings of a hundred cubits; their twenty pillars and their twenty bases were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
Exodus 38-12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their ten pillars, and their ten bases; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
Exodus 38-13 And for the front to the east, fifty cubits.
Exodus 38-14 The hangings for one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and three bases.
Exodus 38-15 And so for the other side. On both sides of the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three bases.
Exodus 38-16 All the hangings around the court were of fine twined linen.
Exodus 38-17 And the bases for the pillars were of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. The overlaying of their capitals was also of silver, and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.
Exodus 38-18 And the screen for the gate of the court was embroidered with needlework in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen. It was twenty cubits long and five cubits high in its breadth, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
Exodus 38-19 And their pillars were four in number. Their four bases were of bronze, their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets of silver.
Exodus 38-20 And all the pegs for the tabernacle and for the court all around were of bronze.
Exodus 38-21 <pb/>These are the records of the tabernacle, <f>ⓔ</f>the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were recorded at the commandment of Moses, the responsibility of the Levites <f>ⓕ</f>under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Exodus 38-22 <f>ⓖ</f> Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses;
Exodus 38-23 and with him was <f>ⓗ</f>Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and designer and embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen.
Exodus 38-24 <pb/>All the gold that was used for the work, in all the construction of the sanctuary, the gold from the offering, was twenty-nine talents and 730 shekels, <f>[2]</f> by <f>ⓘ</f>the shekel of the sanctuary.
Exodus 38-25 The silver from those of the congregation who were recorded was a hundred talents and 1,775 shekels, by the shekel of the sanctuary:
Exodus 38-26 a <f>ⓙ</f>beka <f>[3]</f> a head (that is, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary), for everyone who was listed in the records, from twenty years old and upward, for <f>ⓚ</f>603,550 men.
Exodus 38-27 The hundred talents of silver were for casting the <f>ⓛ</f>bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the veil; a hundred bases for the hundred talents, a talent a base.
Exodus 38-28 And of the 1,775 shekels he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their capitals and made fillets for them.
Exodus 38-29 The bronze that was offered was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels;
Exodus 38-30 with it he made the <f>ⓜ</f>bases for the entrance of the tent of meeting, <f>ⓝ</f>the bronze altar and the bronze grating for it and all the utensils of the altar,
Exodus 38-31 the <f>ⓞ</f>bases around the court, and the <f>ⓟ</f>bases of the gate of the court, all the <f>ⓠ</f>pegs of the tabernacle, and all the pegs around the court.

Ezekiel 16-1 <pb/>Again the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 16-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>make known to Jerusalem her abominations,
Ezekiel 16-3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites; your father was an <f>ⓒ</f>Amorite and your mother a <f>ⓓ</f>Hittite.
Ezekiel 16-4 And as for your birth, <f>ⓔ</f>on the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.
Ezekiel 16-5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you, <f>ⓕ</f>but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, <f>ⓖ</f>on the day that you were born.
Ezekiel 16-6 <pb/>“And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing <f>ⓗ</f>in your blood, I said to you <f>ⓘ</f>in your blood, ‘Live!’ I said to you <f>ⓙ</f>in your blood, ‘Live!’
Ezekiel 16-7 <f>ⓚ</f> I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall <f>ⓛ</f>and arrived at full adornment. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet <f>ⓜ</f>you were naked and bare.
Ezekiel 16-8 <pb/>“When I passed by you again and saw you, behold, you were at the age for love, and <f>ⓝ</f>I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness; I made my vow to you <f>ⓞ</f>and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓟ</f>and you became mine.
Ezekiel 16-9 Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and <f>ⓠ</f>anointed you with oil.
Ezekiel 16-10 <f>ⓡ</f> I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with fine leather. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk. <f>[1]</f>
Ezekiel 16-11 <f>ⓢ</f> And I adorned you with ornaments and <f>ⓣ</f>put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck.
Ezekiel 16-12 And I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
Ezekiel 16-13 Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. <f>ⓤ</f>You ate fine flour and honey and oil. <f>ⓥ</f>You grew exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty.
Ezekiel 16-14 And <f>ⓦ</f>your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor that I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 16-15 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> “But you trusted in your beauty <f>ⓨ</f>and played the whore <f>[2]</f> because of your renown <f>ⓩ</f>and lavished your whorings <f>[3]</f> on any passerby; your beauty <f>[4]</f> became his.
Ezekiel 16-16 You took some of your garments and made for yourself colorful shrines, and on them played the whore. The like has never been, nor ever shall be. <f>[5]</f>
Ezekiel 16-17 You also took <f>ⓐ</f>your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and <f>ⓑ</f>made for yourself images of men, and with them played the whore.
Ezekiel 16-18 And you took your embroidered garments to cover them, <f>ⓒ</f>and set my oil and my incense before them.
Ezekiel 16-19 <f>ⓓ</f> Also my bread that I gave you — <f>ⓔ</f>I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey — you set before them for <f>ⓕ</f>a pleasing aroma; and so it was, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 16-20 <f>ⓖ</f> And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and <f>ⓗ</f>these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your whorings so small a matter
Ezekiel 16-21 that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them?
Ezekiel 16-22 And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember <f>ⓘ</f>the days of your youth, <f>ⓙ</f>when you were naked and bare, wallowing in your blood.
Ezekiel 16-23 <pb/>“And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! declares the Lord GOD),
Ezekiel 16-24 you built yourself <f>ⓚ</f>a vaulted chamber and made yourself a lofty place in every square.
Ezekiel 16-25 At the head of every street <f>ⓛ</f>you built your lofty place and made <f>ⓜ</f>your beauty an abomination, <f>ⓝ</f>offering yourself <f>[6]</f> to any passerby and multiplying your whoring.
Ezekiel 16-26 <f>ⓞ</f> You also played the whore <f>ⓟ</f>with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, <f>ⓠ</f>multiplying your whoring, <f>ⓡ</f>to provoke me to anger.
Ezekiel 16-27 Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you <f>ⓢ</f>and diminished your allotted portion <f>ⓣ</f>and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, <f>ⓤ</f>the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior.
Ezekiel 16-28 <f>ⓥ</f> You played the whore also <f>ⓦ</f>with the Assyrians, because you were not satisfied; yes, you played the whore with them, and still you were not satisfied.
Ezekiel 16-29 You multiplied your whoring also with the trading land <f>ⓧ</f>of Chaldea, and even with this you were not satisfied.
Ezekiel 16-30 <pb/>“How sick is your heart, <f>[7]</f> declares the Lord GOD, because you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen prostitute,
Ezekiel 16-31 building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a prostitute, <f>ⓨ</f>because you scorned payment.
Ezekiel 16-32 Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband!
Ezekiel 16-33 Men give gifts to all prostitutes, <f>ⓩ</f>but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side with your whorings.
Ezekiel 16-34 So you were different from other women in your whorings. No one solicited you to play the whore, and <f>ⓐ</f>you gave payment, while no payment was given to you; therefore you were different.
Ezekiel 16-35 <pb/>“Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD:
Ezekiel 16-36 Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your whorings with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, <f>ⓑ</f>and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them,
Ezekiel 16-37 therefore, behold, <f>ⓒ</f>I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and <f>ⓓ</f>all those you hated. <f>ⓔ</f>I will gather them against you from every side <f>ⓕ</f>and will uncover your nakedness to them, that <f>ⓖ</f>they may see all your nakedness.
Ezekiel 16-38 <f>ⓗ</f> And I will judge you <f>ⓘ</f>as women who commit adultery and <f>ⓙ</f>shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy.
Ezekiel 16-39 And I will give you into their hands, and they shall throw down your <f>ⓚ</f>vaulted chamber and break down <f>ⓛ</f>your lofty places. <f>ⓜ</f>They shall strip you of your clothes and take <f>ⓝ</f>your beautiful jewels and leave you <f>ⓞ</f>naked and bare.
Ezekiel 16-40 <f>ⓟ</f> They shall bring up a crowd against you, <f>ⓠ</f>and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords.
Ezekiel 16-41 <f>ⓡ</f> And they shall <f>ⓢ</f>burn your houses and <f>ⓣ</f>execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women. <f>ⓤ</f>I will make you stop playing the whore, and <f>ⓥ</f>you shall also give payment no more.
Ezekiel 16-42 <f>ⓦ</f> So will I satisfy my wrath on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you. I will be calm and will no more be angry.
Ezekiel 16-43 Because you have not remembered <f>ⓧ</f>the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things, therefore, behold, <f>ⓨ</f>I have returned your deeds upon your head, declares the Lord GOD. Have you not <f>ⓩ</f>committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations?
Ezekiel 16-44 <pb/>“Behold, everyone <f>ⓐ</f>who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you: ‘Like mother, like daughter.’
Ezekiel 16-45 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of <f>ⓑ</f>your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. <f>ⓒ</f>Your mother was a Hittite and <f>ⓓ</f>your father an Amorite.
Ezekiel 16-46 And <f>ⓔ</f>your elder sister is Samaria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and <f>ⓕ</f>your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters.
Ezekiel 16-47 <f>ⓖ</f> Not only did you walk in their ways and do according to their abominations; within a very little time <f>ⓗ</f>you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
Ezekiel 16-48 <f>ⓘ</f> As I live, declares the Lord GOD, your sister <f>ⓙ</f>Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done.
Ezekiel 16-49 Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, <f>ⓚ</f>excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy.
Ezekiel 16-50 They were haughty and <f>ⓛ</f>did an abomination before me. So <f>ⓜ</f>I removed them, when I saw it.
Ezekiel 16-51 <f>ⓝ</f> Samaria has not committed half your sins. You have committed more abominations than they, and <f>ⓞ</f>have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed.
Ezekiel 16-52 <f>ⓟ</f> Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have intervened on behalf of your sisters. Because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous.
Ezekiel 16-53 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in their midst,
Ezekiel 16-54 that you may bear your disgrace <f>ⓡ</f>and be ashamed of all that you have done, <f>ⓢ</f>becoming a consolation to them.
Ezekiel 16-55 As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former state, <f>ⓣ</f>and Samaria and her daughters shall return <f>ⓤ</f>to their former state, <f>ⓥ</f>and you and your daughters shall return <f>ⓦ</f>to your former state.
Ezekiel 16-56 Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth <f>ⓧ</f>in the day of your pride,
Ezekiel 16-57 before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become <f>ⓨ</f>an object of reproach for the daughters of Syria <f>[8]</f> and all those around her, and for <f>ⓩ</f>the daughters of the Philistines, <f>ⓐ</f>those all around who despise you.
Ezekiel 16-58 <f>ⓑ</f> You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the LORD.
Ezekiel 16-59 <pb/>“For thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, you <f>ⓒ</f>who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant,
Ezekiel 16-60 yet <f>ⓓ</f>I will remember my covenant with you <f>ⓔ</f>in the days of your youth, <f>ⓕ</f>and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant.
Ezekiel 16-61 <f>ⓖ</f> Then you will remember your ways <f>ⓗ</f>and be ashamed when you take <f>ⓘ</f>your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and I give them to you <f>ⓙ</f>as daughters, but not on account of <f>[9]</f> the covenant with you.
Ezekiel 16-62 I will establish my covenant with you, <f>ⓚ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD,
Ezekiel 16-63 that you may remember and be confounded, and <f>ⓛ</f>never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I atone for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord GOD.”
Revelation 17-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>one of the seven angels who had <f>ⓑ</f>the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of <f>ⓒ</f>the great prostitute <f>ⓓ</f>who is seated on many waters,
Revelation 17-2 <f>ⓔ</f> with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and <f>ⓕ</f>with the wine of whose sexual immorality <f>ⓖ</f>the dwellers on earth have become drunk.”
Revelation 17-3 And <f>ⓗ</f>he carried me away in the Spirit <f>ⓘ</f>into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on <f>ⓙ</f>a scarlet beast that was full of <f>ⓚ</f>blasphemous names, and <f>ⓛ</f>it had seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation 17-4 The woman <f>ⓜ</f>was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned <f>ⓝ</f>with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand <f>ⓞ</f>a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.
Revelation 17-5 And on her forehead was written a name of <f>ⓟ</f>mystery: <f>ⓠ</f>“Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth's abominations.”
Revelation 17-6 And I saw the woman, drunk <f>ⓡ</f>with the blood of the saints, the blood of <f>ⓢ</f>the martyrs of Jesus. <f>[1]</f> <pb/>When I saw her, I marveled greatly.
Revelation 17-7 But the angel said to me, “Why do you marvel? I will tell you <f>ⓣ</f>the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.
Revelation 17-8 The beast that you saw <f>ⓤ</f>was, and is not, and <f>ⓥ</f>is about to rise from <f>ⓦ</f>the bottomless pit <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓧ</f>go to destruction. And <f>ⓨ</f>the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in <f>ⓩ</f>the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because <f>ⓐ</f>it was and is not and is to come.
Revelation 17-9 <f>ⓑ</f> This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated;
Revelation 17-10 they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while.
Revelation 17-11 As for the beast <f>ⓒ</f>that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.
Revelation 17-12 And <f>ⓓ</f>the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings <f>ⓔ</f>for one hour, together with the beast.
Revelation 17-13 These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.
Revelation 17-14 They <f>ⓕ</f>will make war on the Lamb, and <f>ⓖ</f>the Lamb will conquer them, for he is <f>ⓗ</f>Lord of lords and <f>ⓘ</f>King of kings, and those with him are <f>ⓙ</f>called and chosen and faithful.”
Revelation 17-15 <pb/>And the angel <f>[3]</f> said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.
Revelation 17-16 And <f>ⓛ</f>the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast <f>ⓜ</f>will hate the prostitute. They will make her <f>ⓝ</f>desolate and <f>ⓞ</f>naked, and <f>ⓟ</f>devour her flesh and <f>ⓠ</f>burn her up with fire,
Revelation 17-17 for <f>ⓡ</f>God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and <f>ⓢ</f>handing over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
Revelation 17-18 And the woman that you saw is <f>ⓣ</f>the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.”
