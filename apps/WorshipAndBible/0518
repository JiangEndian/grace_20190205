33-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses, “Depart; go up from here, you <f>ⓐ</f>and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To <f>ⓑ</f>your offspring I will give it.’
33-2 I will send an <f>ⓒ</f>angel before you, <f>ⓓ</f>and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
33-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; <f>ⓕ</f>but I will not go up among you, <f>ⓖ</f>lest I consume you on the way, for you are a <f>ⓗ</f>stiff-necked people.”
33-4 <pb/>When the people heard this disastrous word, they <f>ⓘ</f>mourned, and <f>ⓙ</f>no one put on his ornaments.
33-5 For the LORD had said to Moses, “Say to the people of Israel, ‘You are a <f>ⓚ</f>stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would <f>ⓛ</f>consume you. So now <f>ⓜ</f>take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.’”
33-6 Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
33-7 <pb/>Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and <f>ⓝ</f>he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who <f>ⓞ</f>sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
33-8 Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up, and <f>ⓟ</f>each would stand at his tent door, and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent.
33-9 When Moses entered the tent, the <f>ⓠ</f>pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the LORD <f>[1]</f> would speak with Moses.
33-10 And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, each at his tent door.
33-11 Thus <f>ⓡ</f>the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his <f>ⓢ</f>assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.
33-12 <pb/>Moses said to the LORD, “See, <f>ⓣ</f>you say to me, ‘Bring up this people,’ but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, <f>ⓤ</f>‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’
33-13 Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please <f>ⓥ</f>show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is <f>ⓦ</f>your people.”
33-14 And he said, <f>ⓧ</f>“My presence will go with you, and <f>ⓨ</f>I will give you rest.”
33-15 And he said to him, <f>ⓩ</f>“If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here.
33-16 For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? <f>ⓐ</f>Is it not in your going with us, <f>ⓑ</f>so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?”
33-17 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “This very thing that you have spoken I will do, <f>ⓒ</f>for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.”
33-18 Moses said, “Please <f>ⓓ</f>show me your glory.”
33-19 And he said, <f>ⓔ</f>“I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name ‘The LORD.’ And <f>ⓕ</f>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
33-20 But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for <f>ⓖ</f>man shall not see me and live.”
33-21 And the LORD said, “Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock,
33-22 and while my glory passes by I will put you in a <f>ⓗ</f>cleft of the rock, and I will <f>ⓘ</f>cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
33-23 Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall <f>ⓙ</f>not be seen.”
12-1 <pb/>Then Job answered and said:
12-2 <pb/><t>“No doubt you are the people, </t><t>and wisdom will die with you.</t>
12-3 <t>But I have <f>ⓐ</f>understanding as well as you; </t><t>I am not inferior to you. </t><t>Who does not know <f>ⓑ</f>such things as these?</t>
12-4 <t>I am <f>ⓒ</f>a laughingstock to my friends; </t><t>I, who <f>ⓓ</f>called to God and he answered me, </t><t>a just and blameless man, am a laughingstock.</t>
12-5 <t>In the thought of one who is <f>ⓔ</f>at ease there is contempt for misfortune; </t><t>it is ready for those whose feet slip.</t>
12-6 <t><f>ⓕ</f> The tents of robbers are at peace, </t><t>and those who provoke God are secure, </t><t>who bring their god in their hand. <f>[1]</f> </t>
12-7 <pb/><t>“But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; </t><t>the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you;</t>
12-8 <t>or the bushes of the earth, and they will teach you; <f>[2]</f> </t><t>and the fish of the sea will declare to you.</t>
12-9 <t>Who among all these does not know </t><t>that <f>ⓖ</f>the hand of the LORD has done this?</t>
12-10 <t>In <f>ⓗ</f>his hand is the life of every living thing </t><t>and the breath of all mankind.</t>
12-11 <t>Does not <f>ⓘ</f>the ear test words </t><t>as the palate tastes food?</t>
12-12 <t>Wisdom is with <f>ⓙ</f>the aged, </t><t>and understanding in length of days. </t>
12-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> “With God <f>[3]</f> are wisdom and might; </t><t>he has counsel and understanding.</t>
12-14 <t>If he tears down, none can rebuild; </t><t>if he <f>ⓛ</f>shuts a man in, none can open.</t>
12-15 <t>If he <f>ⓜ</f>withholds the waters, they dry up; </t><t>if he <f>ⓝ</f>sends them out, they overwhelm the land.</t>
12-16 <t>With him are strength and <f>ⓞ</f>sound wisdom; </t><t>the deceived and the deceiver are his.</t>
12-17 <t>He leads <f>ⓟ</f>counselors away stripped, </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>judges he makes fools.</t>
12-18 <t>He <f>ⓡ</f>looses the bonds of kings </t><t>and binds a waistcloth on their hips.</t>
12-19 <t>He leads priests away stripped </t><t>and overthrows the mighty.</t>
12-20 <t>He deprives of speech those who are trusted </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>and takes away the discernment of the elders.</t>
12-21 <t>He <f>ⓣ</f>pours contempt on princes </t><t>and loosens the belt of the strong.</t>
12-22 <t>He <f>ⓤ</f>uncovers the deeps out of darkness </t><t>and brings <f>ⓥ</f>deep darkness to light.</t>
12-23 <t>He <f>ⓦ</f>makes nations great, and he destroys them; </t><t>he enlarges nations, and <f>ⓧ</f>leads them away.</t>
12-24 <t>He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>makes them wander in a trackless waste.</t>
12-25 <t>They <f>ⓩ</f>grope in the dark without light, </t><t>and he makes them <f>ⓐ</f>stagger like a drunken man. </t>
11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to <f>ⓑ</f>the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were <f>ⓒ</f>twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah <f>ⓓ</f>the son of Azzur, and <f>ⓔ</f>Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
11-2 And he said to me, <f>ⓕ</f>“Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;
11-3 <f>ⓖ</f> who say, <f>ⓗ</f>‘The time is not near <f>[1]</f> to build houses. <f>ⓘ</f>This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’
11-4 Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man.”
11-5 <pb/>And <f>ⓙ</f>the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, “Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel. <f>ⓚ</f>For I know the things that come into your mind.
11-6 <f>ⓛ</f> You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain.
11-7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓜ</f>Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, <f>ⓝ</f>they are the meat, and <f>ⓞ</f>this city is the cauldron, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it.
11-8 <f>ⓟ</f> You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord GOD.
11-9 And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and <f>ⓠ</f>give you into the hands of foreigners, and <f>ⓡ</f>execute judgments upon you.
11-10 <f>ⓢ</f> You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, <f>ⓣ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.
11-11 <f>ⓤ</f> This city shall not be your cauldron, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
11-12 and you shall know that I am the LORD. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, <f>ⓥ</f>but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you.”
11-13 <pb/>And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, <f>ⓦ</f>that <f>ⓧ</f>Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. <f>ⓨ</f>Then I fell down on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, <f>ⓩ</f>“Ah, Lord GOD! <f>ⓐ</f>Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?”
11-14 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
11-15 <f>ⓑ</f> “Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, your kinsmen, <f>[2]</f> the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, <f>ⓒ</f>‘Go far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession.’
11-16 Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet <f>ⓓ</f>I have been a sanctuary to them for a while <f>[3]</f> in the countries where they have gone.’
11-17 Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓔ</f>I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, <f>ⓕ</f>and I will give you the land of Israel.’
11-18 And when they come there, <f>ⓖ</f>they will remove from it all its <f>ⓗ</f>detestable things and all its abominations.
11-19 <f>ⓘ</f> And I will give them one heart, and <f>ⓙ</f>a new spirit I will put within them. <f>ⓚ</f>I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh <f>ⓛ</f>and give them a heart of flesh,
11-20 <f>ⓜ</f> that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. <f>ⓝ</f>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
11-21 <f>ⓞ</f> But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, <f>ⓟ</f>I will <f>[4]</f> bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD.”
11-22 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, <f>ⓡ</f>and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
11-23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and <f>ⓢ</f>stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city.
11-24 <f>ⓣ</f> And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me <f>ⓤ</f>in the vision by the Spirit of God <f>ⓥ</f>into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.
11-25 And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
12-1 <pb/>And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman <f>ⓐ</f>clothed with <f>ⓑ</f>the sun, with <f>ⓒ</f>the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
12-2 She was pregnant and <f>ⓓ</f>was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth.
12-3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great <f>ⓔ</f>red dragon, <f>ⓕ</f>with seven heads and <f>ⓖ</f>ten horns, and on his heads <f>ⓗ</f>seven diadems.
12-4 His tail swept down <f>ⓘ</f>a third of the stars of heaven and <f>ⓙ</f>cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child <f>ⓚ</f>he might devour it.
12-5 She gave birth to a male child, <f>ⓛ</f>one who is to rule <f>[1]</f> all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was <f>ⓜ</f>caught up to God and to his throne,
12-6 and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for <f>ⓝ</f>1,260 days.
12-7 <pb/>Now war arose in heaven, <f>ⓞ</f>Michael and <f>ⓟ</f>his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back,
12-8 but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
12-9 And <f>ⓠ</f>the great dragon was thrown down, <f>ⓡ</f>that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, <f>ⓢ</f>the deceiver of the whole world — <f>ⓣ</f>he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
12-10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now <f>ⓤ</f>the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers <f>[2]</f> has been thrown down, <f>ⓥ</f>who accuses them day and night before our God.
12-11 And <f>ⓦ</f>they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for <f>ⓧ</f>they loved not their lives <f>ⓨ</f>even unto death.
12-12 Therefore, <f>ⓩ</f>rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But <f>ⓐ</f>woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because <f>ⓑ</f>he knows that his time is short!”
12-13 <pb/>And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued <f>ⓒ</f>the woman who had given birth to the male child.
12-14 But the woman was given the two <f>ⓓ</f>wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent <f>ⓔ</f>into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished <f>ⓕ</f>for a time, and times, and half a time.
12-15 The serpent poured water <f>ⓖ</f>like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood.
12-16 But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.
12-17 Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off <f>ⓗ</f>to make war on the rest of <f>ⓘ</f>her offspring, <f>ⓙ</f>on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to <f>ⓚ</f>the testimony of Jesus. And he stood <f>[3]</f> on the sand of the sea.
