Genesis 47-1 <pb/>So Joseph <f>ⓐ</f>went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan. They are now in <f>ⓑ</f>the land of Goshen.”
Genesis 47-2 And from among his brothers he took five men and <f>ⓒ</f>presented them to Pharaoh.
Genesis 47-3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, <f>ⓓ</f>“What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, <f>ⓔ</f>“Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were.”
Genesis 47-4 They said to Pharaoh, <f>ⓕ</f>“We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell <f>ⓖ</f>in the land of Goshen.”
Genesis 47-5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
Genesis 47-6 The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers <f>ⓗ</f>in the best of the land. <f>ⓘ</f>Let them settle in the land of Goshen, and if you know any <f>ⓙ</f>able men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.”
Genesis 47-7 <pb/>Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh, <f>ⓚ</f>and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis 47-8 And Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?”
Genesis 47-9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my <f>ⓛ</f>sojourning are 130 years. <f>ⓜ</f>Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and <f>ⓝ</f>they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their <f>ⓞ</f>sojourning.”
Genesis 47-10 And Jacob <f>ⓟ</f>blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
Genesis 47-11 Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of <f>ⓠ</f>Rameses, <f>ⓡ</f>as Pharaoh had commanded.
Genesis 47-12 And Joseph <f>ⓢ</f>provided his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their dependents.
Genesis 47-13 <pb/>Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine.
Genesis 47-14 <f>ⓣ</f> And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, in exchange for the grain that they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
Genesis 47-15 And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. <f>ⓤ</f>Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone.”
Genesis 47-16 And Joseph answered, “Give your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.”
Genesis 47-17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.
Genesis 47-18 And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent. The herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land.
Genesis 47-19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? <f>ⓥ</f>Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.”
Genesis 47-20 <pb/>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe on them. The land became Pharaoh's.
Genesis 47-21 As for the people, he made servants of them <f>[1]</f> from one end of Egypt to the other.
Genesis 47-22 <f>ⓦ</f> Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.
Genesis 47-23 <pb/>Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
Genesis 47-24 And at the harvests you shall give a <f>ⓧ</f>fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones.”
Genesis 47-25 And they said, “You have saved our lives; <f>ⓨ</f>may it please my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh.”
Genesis 47-26 So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; <f>ⓩ</f>the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.
Genesis 47-27 <pb/>Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, <f>ⓐ</f>in the land of Goshen. <f>ⓑ</f>And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.
Genesis 47-28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. <f>ⓒ</f>So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years.
Genesis 47-29 <pb/>And <f>ⓓ</f>when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now <f>ⓔ</f>I have found favor in your sight, <f>ⓕ</f>put your hand under my thigh and <f>ⓖ</f>promise to deal kindly and truly with me. <f>ⓗ</f>Do not bury me in Egypt,
Genesis 47-30 but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and <f>ⓘ</f>bury me in their burying place.” He answered, “I will do as you have said.”
Genesis 47-31 And he said, “Swear to me”; and he swore to him. Then <f>ⓙ</f>Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed. <f>[2]</f>
Ezra 9-1 <pb/>After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, “The people of Israel and the priests and the <f>ⓐ</f>Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands <f>ⓑ</f>with their abominations, from the <f>ⓒ</f>Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
Ezra 9-2 <f>ⓓ</f> For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the <f>ⓔ</f>holy race <f>[1]</f> has <f>ⓕ</f>mixed itself with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost.”
Ezra 9-3 As soon as I heard this, I <f>ⓖ</f>tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and <f>ⓗ</f>sat appalled.
Ezra 9-4 Then all who <f>ⓘ</f>trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered around me while I sat <f>ⓙ</f>appalled until the evening sacrifice.
Ezra 9-5 And at the <f>ⓚ</f>evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garment <f>ⓛ</f>and my cloak torn, and fell upon my knees <f>ⓜ</f>and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
Ezra 9-6 saying: <pb/>“O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to you, my God, for our iniquities <f>ⓝ</f>have risen higher than our heads, and our <f>ⓞ</f>guilt has <f>ⓟ</f>mounted up to the heavens.
Ezra 9-7 <f>ⓠ</f> From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great <f>ⓡ</f>guilt. And for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, <f>ⓢ</f>and to utter shame, as it is today.
Ezra 9-8 But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the LORD our God, to leave us a <f>ⓣ</f>remnant and to give us a <f>ⓤ</f>secure hold <f>[2]</f> within his holy place, that our God may <f>ⓥ</f>brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our slavery.
Ezra 9-9 <f>ⓦ</f> For we are slaves. Yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, <f>ⓧ</f>but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection <f>[3]</f> in Judea and Jerusalem.
Ezra 9-10 <pb/>“And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments,
Ezra 9-11 which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land that you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land impure with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with <f>ⓨ</f>their uncleanness.
Ezra 9-12 <f>ⓩ</f> Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land <f>ⓐ</f>and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.’
Ezra 9-13 And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for <f>ⓑ</f>our great guilt, seeing that you, our <f>ⓒ</f>God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have given us such a <f>ⓓ</f>remnant as this,
Ezra 9-14 shall we break your commandments again and <f>ⓔ</f>intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would you not be angry with us <f>ⓕ</f>until you consumed us, so that there should be no <f>ⓖ</f>remnant, nor any to escape?
Ezra 9-15 O LORD, the God of Israel, you are just, for we are left a <f>ⓗ</f>remnant that has escaped, as it is today. Behold, we are before you in our <f>ⓘ</f>guilt, <f>ⓙ</f>for none can stand before you because of this.”
Jeremiah 32-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD <f>ⓐ</f>in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, <f>ⓑ</f>which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
Jeremiah 32-2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet <f>ⓒ</f>was shut up in <f>ⓓ</f>the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah.
Jeremiah 32-3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓔ</f>Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it;
Jeremiah 32-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, <f>ⓖ</f>but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye.
Jeremiah 32-5 And <f>ⓗ</f>he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I visit him, declares the LORD. <f>ⓘ</f>Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed’?”
Jeremiah 32-6 <pb/>Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah 32-7 Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, <f>ⓙ</f>‘Buy my field that is at <f>ⓚ</f>Anathoth, <f>ⓛ</f>for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.’
Jeremiah 32-8 Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in <f>ⓜ</f>the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, ‘Buy my field that is at <f>ⓝ</f>Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
Jeremiah 32-9 <pb/>“And I bought the field at <f>ⓞ</f>Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and <f>ⓟ</f>weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
Jeremiah 32-10 <f>ⓠ</f> I signed the deed, <f>ⓡ</f>sealed it, <f>ⓢ</f>got witnesses, and <f>ⓣ</f>weighed the money on scales.
Jeremiah 32-11 Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy.
Jeremiah 32-12 And I gave the deed of purchase to <f>ⓤ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of <f>ⓥ</f>the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in <f>ⓦ</f>the court of the guard.
Jeremiah 32-13 I charged <f>ⓧ</f>Baruch in their presence, saying,
Jeremiah 32-14 ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time.
Jeremiah 32-15 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and <f>ⓨ</f>fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’
Jeremiah 32-16 <pb/>“After I had given the deed of purchase to <f>ⓩ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:
Jeremiah 32-17 ‘Ah, Lord GOD! It is <f>ⓐ</f>you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by <f>ⓑ</f>your outstretched arm! <f>ⓒ</f>Nothing is too hard for you.
Jeremiah 32-18 <f>ⓓ</f> You show steadfast love to thousands, <f>ⓔ</f>but you repay the guilt of fathers <f>ⓕ</f>to their children after them, O great and <f>ⓖ</f>mighty God, whose name is the <f>ⓗ</f>LORD of hosts,
Jeremiah 32-19 <f>ⓘ</f> great in counsel and <f>ⓙ</f>mighty in deed, <f>ⓚ</f>whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of man, <f>ⓛ</f>rewarding each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.
Jeremiah 32-20 You have shown <f>ⓜ</f>signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, <f>ⓝ</f>and have made a name for yourself, as at this day.
Jeremiah 32-21 <f>ⓞ</f> You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and <f>ⓟ</f>outstretched arm, <f>ⓠ</f>and with great terror.
Jeremiah 32-22 And you gave them this land, <f>ⓡ</f>which you swore to their fathers to give them, <f>ⓢ</f>a land flowing with milk and honey.
Jeremiah 32-23 And they entered and took possession of it. <f>ⓣ</f>But they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of all you commanded them to do. Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them.
Jeremiah 32-24 Behold, <f>ⓤ</f>the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and <f>ⓥ</f>because of sword and famine and pestilence <f>ⓦ</f>the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has come to pass, and behold, you see it.
Jeremiah 32-25 Yet you, O Lord GOD, have said to me, <f>ⓧ</f>“Buy the field for money <f>ⓨ</f>and get witnesses” — though <f>ⓩ</f>the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.’”
Jeremiah 32-26 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 32-27 “Behold, I am the LORD, <f>ⓐ</f>the God of all flesh. <f>ⓑ</f>Is anything too hard for me?
Jeremiah 32-28 Therefore, thus says the LORD: <f>ⓒ</f>Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
Jeremiah 32-29 The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city <f>ⓓ</f>shall come and set this city on fire and burn it, <f>ⓔ</f>with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to Baal <f>ⓕ</f>and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, <f>ⓖ</f>to provoke me to anger.
Jeremiah 32-30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight <f>ⓗ</f>from their youth. The children of Israel have done nothing but <f>ⓘ</f>provoke me to anger <f>ⓙ</f>by the work of their hands, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 32-31 This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, <f>ⓚ</f>so that I will remove it from my sight
Jeremiah 32-32 because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger — <f>ⓛ</f>their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 32-33 <f>ⓜ</f> They have turned to me their back and not their face. And though I have taught them <f>ⓝ</f>persistently, they have not listened <f>ⓞ</f>to receive instruction.
Jeremiah 32-34 They set up <f>ⓟ</f>their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
Jeremiah 32-35 They built the high places of Baal <f>ⓠ</f>in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, <f>ⓡ</f>to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, <f>ⓢ</f>though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do <f>ⓣ</f>this abomination, <f>ⓤ</f>to cause Judah to sin.
Jeremiah 32-36 <pb/>“Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, <f>ⓥ</f>‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence’:
Jeremiah 32-37 <f>ⓦ</f> Behold, I will gather them from all the countries <f>ⓧ</f>to which I drove them in <f>ⓨ</f>my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. I will bring them back to this place, <f>ⓩ</f>and I will make them dwell in safety.
Jeremiah 32-38 <f>ⓐ</f> And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
Jeremiah 32-39 <f>ⓑ</f> I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, <f>ⓒ</f>for their own good and the good of their children after them.
Jeremiah 32-40 <f>ⓓ</f> I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. <f>ⓔ</f>And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me.
Jeremiah 32-41 <f>ⓕ</f> I will rejoice in doing them good, <f>ⓖ</f>and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.
Jeremiah 32-42 <pb/>“For thus says the LORD: <f>ⓗ</f>Just as I have brought all this great disaster upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them.
Jeremiah 32-43 <f>ⓘ</f> Fields shall be bought in this land <f>ⓙ</f>of which you are saying, ‘It is a desolation, without man or beast; <f>ⓚ</f>it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’
Jeremiah 32-44 Fields shall be bought for money, and <f>ⓛ</f>deeds shall be signed and <f>ⓜ</f>sealed and <f>ⓝ</f>witnessed, <f>ⓞ</f>in the land of Benjamin, <f>ⓟ</f>in the places about Jerusalem, <f>ⓠ</f>and in the cities of Judah, <f>ⓡ</f>in the cities of the hill country, <f>ⓢ</f>in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for <f>ⓣ</f>I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD.”
Hebrews 10-1 <pb/>For since the law has but <f>ⓐ</f>a shadow <f>ⓑ</f>of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, <f>ⓒ</f>it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.
Hebrews 10-2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
Hebrews 10-3 But <f>ⓓ</f>in these sacrifices <f>ⓔ</f>there is a reminder of sins every year.
Hebrews 10-4 For <f>ⓕ</f>it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews 10-5 <pb/>Consequently, <f>ⓖ</f>when Christ <f>[1]</f> came into the world, he said, <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f>“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, </t><t>but a body have you prepared for me;</t>
Hebrews 10-6 <t>in burnt offerings and sin offerings </t><t>you have taken no pleasure.</t>
Hebrews 10-7 <t>Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, </t><t>as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’” </t>
Hebrews 10-8 <pb/>When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in <f>ⓘ</f>sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law),
Hebrews 10-9 then he added, <f>ⓙ</f>“Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second.
Hebrews 10-10 And by that will <f>ⓚ</f>we have been sanctified through the offering of <f>ⓛ</f>the body of Jesus Christ <f>ⓜ</f>once for all.
Hebrews 10-11 <pb/>And every priest stands <f>ⓝ</f>daily at his service, <f>ⓞ</f>offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, <f>ⓟ</f>which can never take away sins.
Hebrews 10-12 But when Christ <f>[2]</f> had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he <f>ⓠ</f>sat down at the right hand of God,
Hebrews 10-13 waiting from that time <f>ⓡ</f>until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet.
Hebrews 10-14 For by a single offering <f>ⓢ</f>he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
Hebrews 10-15 <pb/>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
Hebrews 10-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> “This is the covenant that I will make with them </t><t>after those days, declares the Lord: </t><t>I will put my laws on their hearts, </t><t>and write them on their minds,” </t>
Hebrews 10-17 <pb/>then he adds, <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” </t>
Hebrews 10-18 <pb/>Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
Hebrews 10-19 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Therefore, brothers, <f>[3]</f> since we have confidence to enter <f>ⓦ</f>the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews 10-20 by <f>ⓧ</f>the new and living way that he opened for us through <f>ⓨ</f>the curtain, that is, through his flesh,
Hebrews 10-21 and since we have <f>ⓩ</f>a great priest over the house of God,
Hebrews 10-22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts <f>ⓐ</f>sprinkled clean <f>ⓑ</f>from an evil conscience and our bodies <f>ⓒ</f>washed with pure water.
Hebrews 10-23 <f>ⓓ</f> Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for <f>ⓔ</f>he who promised is faithful.
Hebrews 10-24 And <f>ⓕ</f>let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,
Hebrews 10-25 <f>ⓖ</f> not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and <f>ⓗ</f>all the more as you see <f>ⓘ</f>the Day drawing near.
Hebrews 10-26 <pb/>For <f>ⓙ</f>if we go on sinning deliberately <f>ⓚ</f>after receiving the knowledge of the truth, <f>ⓛ</f>there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
Hebrews 10-27 <f>ⓜ</f> but a fearful expectation of judgment, and <f>ⓝ</f>a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.
Hebrews 10-28 <f>ⓞ</f> Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy <f>ⓟ</f>on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews 10-29 How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one <f>ⓠ</f>who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned <f>ⓡ</f>the blood of the covenant <f>ⓢ</f>by which he was sanctified, and has <f>ⓣ</f>outraged the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews 10-30 For we know him who said, <f>ⓤ</f>“Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again, <f>ⓥ</f>“The Lord will judge his people.”
Hebrews 10-31 <f>ⓦ</f> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews 10-32 <pb/>But recall the former days when, after <f>ⓧ</f>you were enlightened, you endured <f>ⓨ</f>a hard struggle with sufferings,
Hebrews 10-33 sometimes being <f>ⓩ</f>publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
Hebrews 10-34 For <f>ⓐ</f>you had compassion on those in prison, and <f>ⓑ</f>you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had <f>ⓒ</f>a better possession and an abiding one.
Hebrews 10-35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has <f>ⓓ</f>a great reward.
Hebrews 10-36 For <f>ⓔ</f>you have need of endurance, so that <f>ⓕ</f>when you have done the will of God you may <f>ⓖ</f>receive what is promised.
Hebrews 10-37 For, <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f>“Yet a little while, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>the coming one will come and will not delay;</t>
Hebrews 10-38 <t><f>ⓙ</f> but my righteous one shall live by faith, </t><t>and if he shrinks back, </t><t>my soul has no pleasure in him.” </t>
Hebrews 10-39 <pb/>But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.
