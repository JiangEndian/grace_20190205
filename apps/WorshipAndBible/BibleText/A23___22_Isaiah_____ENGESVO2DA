Isaiah 22-1 <pb/>The <f>ⓐ</f>oracle concerning <f>ⓑ</f>the valley of vision. <pb/><t>What do you mean that you have gone up, </t><t>all of you, to the housetops,</t>
Isaiah 22-2 <t>you who are full of shoutings, </t><t>tumultuous city, <f>ⓒ</f>exultant town? </t><t>Your slain are <f>ⓓ</f>not slain with the sword </t><t>or dead in battle.</t>
Isaiah 22-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> All your leaders have fled together; </t><t>without the bow they were captured. </t><t>All of you who were found were captured, </t><t>though they had fled far away.</t>
Isaiah 22-4 <t>Therefore I said: </t><t>“Look away from me; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>let me weep bitter tears; </t><t>do not labor to comfort me </t><t>concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people.” </t>
Isaiah 22-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> For the Lord GOD of hosts has <f>ⓗ</f>a day </t><t>of tumult and <f>ⓘ</f>trampling and <f>ⓙ</f>confusion </t><t>in <f>ⓚ</f>the valley of vision, </t><t>a battering down of walls </t><t>and a shouting to the mountains.</t>
Isaiah 22-6 <t>And <f>ⓛ</f>Elam bore the quiver </t><t>with chariots and horsemen, </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>Kir uncovered the shield.</t>
Isaiah 22-7 <t>Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, </t><t>and the horsemen took their stand at the gates.</t>
Isaiah 22-8 <t>He has taken away <f>ⓝ</f>the covering of Judah. </t> <pb/>In that day you looked to <f>ⓞ</f>the weapons of the House of the Forest,
Isaiah 22-9 and you saw that <f>ⓟ</f>the breaches of the city of David were many. <f>ⓠ</f>You collected the waters of the lower pool,
Isaiah 22-10 and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.
Isaiah 22-11 <f>ⓡ</f> You made a reservoir between <f>ⓢ</f>the two walls for the water of <f>ⓣ</f>the old pool. But <f>ⓤ</f>you did not look to him who did it, or see him who planned it long ago.
Isaiah 22-12 <pb/><t>In that day <f>ⓥ</f>the Lord GOD of hosts </t><t>called for weeping and mourning, </t><t>for <f>ⓦ</f>baldness and <f>ⓧ</f>wearing sackcloth;</t>
Isaiah 22-13 <t>and behold, joy and gladness, </t><t>killing oxen and slaughtering sheep, </t><t>eating flesh and drinking wine. </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>“Let us eat and drink, </t><t>for tomorrow we die.”</t>
Isaiah 22-14 <t>The LORD of hosts <f>ⓩ</f>has revealed himself in my ears: </t><t>“Surely <f>ⓐ</f>this iniquity will not be atoned for you <f>ⓑ</f>until you die,” </t><t>says the Lord GOD of hosts. </t>
Isaiah 22-15 <pb/>Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts, “Come, go to this steward, to <f>ⓒ</f>Shebna, who is over the household, and say to him:
Isaiah 22-16 What have you to do here, and whom have you here, <f>ⓓ</f>that you have cut out here a tomb for yourself, you <f>ⓔ</f>who cut out a tomb on the height and carve a dwelling for yourself in the rock?
Isaiah 22-17 Behold, the LORD will hurl you away violently, O you strong man. <f>ⓕ</f>He will seize firm hold on you
Isaiah 22-18 and whirl you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a wide land. There you shall die, and there shall be <f>ⓖ</f>your glorious chariots, you shame of your master's house.
Isaiah 22-19 <f>ⓗ</f> I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station.
Isaiah 22-20 In that day I will call my servant <f>ⓘ</f>Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
Isaiah 22-21 and <f>ⓙ</f>I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be <f>ⓚ</f>a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
Isaiah 22-22 And I will place <f>ⓛ</f>on his shoulder <f>ⓜ</f>the key of the house of David. <f>ⓝ</f>He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
Isaiah 22-23 And I will fasten him <f>ⓞ</f>like a peg in a secure place, and he will become <f>ⓟ</f>a throne of honor to his father's house.
Isaiah 22-24 And they will hang on him the whole honor of his father's house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons.
Isaiah 22-25 In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓠ</f>the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken.”
