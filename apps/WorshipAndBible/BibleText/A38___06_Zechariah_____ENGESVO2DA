Zechariah 6-1 <pb/>Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of <f>ⓐ</f>bronze.
Zechariah 6-2 The first chariot had <f>ⓑ</f>red horses, the second <f>ⓒ</f>black horses,
Zechariah 6-3 the third <f>ⓓ</f>white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses — all of them strong. <f>[1]</f>
Zechariah 6-4 Then I answered and said to <f>ⓔ</f>the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
Zechariah 6-5 And the angel answered and said to me, <f>ⓕ</f>“These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after <f>ⓖ</f>presenting themselves before <f>ⓗ</f>the Lord of all the earth.
Zechariah 6-6 The chariot with the black horses goes toward <f>ⓘ</f>the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward <f>ⓙ</f>the south country.”
Zechariah 6-7 When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and <f>ⓚ</f>patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, <f>ⓛ</f>patrol the earth.” <f>ⓜ</f>So they patrolled the earth.
Zechariah 6-8 Then he cried to me, “Behold, those who go toward <f>ⓝ</f>the north country have set my Spirit at rest in <f>ⓞ</f>the north country.”
Zechariah 6-9 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Zechariah 6-10 “Take from the exiles <f>ⓟ</f>Heldai, Tobijah, and <f>ⓠ</f>Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of <f>ⓡ</f>Zephaniah.
Zechariah 6-11 Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, <f>ⓢ</f>and set it on the head of <f>ⓣ</f>Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
Zechariah 6-12 And say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Behold, the man whose name is <f>ⓤ</f>the Branch: for he shall branch out from his place, and <f>ⓥ</f>he shall build the temple of the LORD.
Zechariah 6-13 <f>ⓦ</f> It is he who shall build the temple of the LORD <f>ⓧ</f>and shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule on his throne. And there <f>[2]</f> shall be a <f>ⓨ</f>priest on his throne, <f>ⓩ</f>and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.”’
Zechariah 6-14 And the crown shall be in the temple of the LORD as <f>ⓐ</f>a reminder to <f>ⓑ</f>Helem, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>Tobijah, <f>ⓓ</f>Jedaiah, and Hen <f>ⓔ</f>the son of Zephaniah.
Zechariah 6-15 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> “And those who are far off shall come and <f>ⓖ</f>help to build the temple of the LORD. <f>ⓗ</f>And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. <f>ⓘ</f>And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.”
