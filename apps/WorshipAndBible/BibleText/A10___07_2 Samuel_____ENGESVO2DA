2 Samuel 7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when the king lived in his house and the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies,
2 Samuel 7-2 the king said to <f>ⓒ</f>Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell <f>ⓓ</f>in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells <f>ⓔ</f>in a tent.”
2 Samuel 7-3 And Nathan said to the king, <f>ⓕ</f>“Go, do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”
2 Samuel 7-4 <pb/>But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan,
2 Samuel 7-5 “Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓖ</f>Would you build me a house to dwell in?
2 Samuel 7-6 I have not lived in a house <f>ⓗ</f>since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about <f>ⓘ</f>in a tent for my dwelling.
2 Samuel 7-7 In all places where <f>ⓙ</f>I have moved with all the people of Israel, did I speak a word with <f>ⓚ</f>any of the judges <f>[1]</f> of Israel, whom I commanded <f>ⓛ</f>to shepherd my people Israel, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’
2 Samuel 7-8 Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓜ</f>I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince <f>[2]</f> over my people Israel.
2 Samuel 7-9 <f>ⓝ</f> And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
2 Samuel 7-10 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel <f>ⓞ</f>and will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place <f>ⓟ</f>and be disturbed no more. <f>ⓠ</f>And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly,
2 Samuel 7-11 <f>ⓡ</f> from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And <f>ⓢ</f>I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that <f>ⓣ</f>the LORD will make you a house.
2 Samuel 7-12 <f>ⓤ</f> When your days are fulfilled and <f>ⓥ</f>you lie down with your fathers, <f>ⓦ</f>I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
2 Samuel 7-13 <f>ⓧ</f> He shall build a house for my name, and <f>ⓨ</f>I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
2 Samuel 7-14 <f>ⓩ</f> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, <f>ⓐ</f>I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men,
2 Samuel 7-15 <f>ⓑ</f> but my steadfast love will not depart from him, <f>ⓒ</f>as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you.
2 Samuel 7-16 <f>ⓓ</f> And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>Your throne shall be established forever.’”
2 Samuel 7-17 In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
2 Samuel 7-18 <pb/>Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and said, <f>ⓕ</f>“Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
2 Samuel 7-19 And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord GOD. <f>ⓖ</f>You have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come, and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord GOD!
2 Samuel 7-20 And what more can David say to you? <f>ⓗ</f>For you know your servant, O Lord GOD!
2 Samuel 7-21 Because of your promise, and according to your own heart, you have brought about all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
2 Samuel 7-22 <f>ⓘ</f> Therefore you are great, O LORD God. <f>ⓙ</f>For there is none like you, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
2 Samuel 7-23 <f>ⓚ</f> And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making himself a name <f>ⓛ</f>and doing for them <f>[4]</f> great and awesome things by driving out before your people, <f>[5]</f> whom <f>ⓜ</f>you redeemed for yourself from Egypt, a nation and its gods?
2 Samuel 7-24 <f>ⓝ</f> And you established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever. And you, O LORD, became their God.
2 Samuel 7-25 And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, and do as you have spoken.
2 Samuel 7-26 And your name will be magnified forever, saying, ‘The LORD of hosts is God over Israel,’ and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
2 Samuel 7-27 For you, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made this revelation to your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house.’ Therefore your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you.
2 Samuel 7-28 And now, O Lord GOD, you are God, and <f>ⓞ</f>your words are true, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
2 Samuel 7-29 Now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you, O Lord GOD, have spoken, <f>ⓟ</f>and with your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever.”
