Genesis 21-1 <pb/>The LORD <f>ⓐ</f>visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah <f>ⓑ</f>as he had promised.
Genesis 21-2 And Sarah <f>ⓒ</f>conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age <f>ⓓ</f>at the time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis 21-3 Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, <f>ⓔ</f>Isaac. <f>[1]</f>
Genesis 21-4 And Abraham <f>ⓕ</f>circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, <f>ⓖ</f>as God had commanded him.
Genesis 21-5 <f>ⓗ</f> Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis 21-6 And Sarah said, <f>ⓘ</f>“God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.”
Genesis 21-7 And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? <f>ⓙ</f>Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
Genesis 21-8 <pb/>And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis 21-9 But Sarah <f>ⓚ</f>saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, <f>ⓛ</f>laughing. <f>[2]</f>
Genesis 21-10 So she said to Abraham, <f>ⓜ</f>“Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.”
Genesis 21-11 And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
Genesis 21-12 But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for <f>ⓝ</f>through Isaac shall your offspring be named.
Genesis 21-13 And I will make <f>ⓞ</f>a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.”
Genesis 21-14 So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of <f>ⓟ</f>Beersheba.
Genesis 21-15 <pb/>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes.
Genesis 21-16 Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, “Let me not look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
Genesis 21-17 And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
Genesis 21-18 Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”
Genesis 21-19 Then <f>ⓠ</f>God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
Genesis 21-20 And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness <f>ⓡ</f>and became an expert with the bow.
Genesis 21-21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
Genesis 21-22 <pb/>At that time <f>ⓢ</f>Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, <f>ⓣ</f>“God is with you in all that you do.
Genesis 21-23 Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but <f>ⓤ</f>as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.”
Genesis 21-24 And Abraham said, “I will swear.”
Genesis 21-25 <pb/>When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants <f>ⓥ</f>had seized,
Genesis 21-26 Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.”
Genesis 21-27 So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men <f>ⓦ</f>made a covenant.
Genesis 21-28 Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.
Genesis 21-29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?”
Genesis 21-30 He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this <f>[3]</f> may be a witness for me that I dug this well.”
Genesis 21-31 Therefore <f>ⓧ</f>that place was called Beersheba, <f>[4]</f> because there both of them swore an oath.
Genesis 21-32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
Genesis 21-33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and <f>ⓨ</f>called there on the name of the LORD, <f>ⓩ</f>the Everlasting God.
Genesis 21-34 And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.
