2 Kings 14-10 You have indeed <f>ⓟ</f>struck down Edom, <f>ⓠ</f>and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home, for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?”
2 Kings 14-11 <pb/>But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah <f>ⓡ</f>faced one another in battle at <f>ⓢ</f>Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
