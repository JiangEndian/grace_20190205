2 Timothy 2-1 <pb/>You then, <f>ⓐ</f>my child, <f>ⓑ</f>be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus,
2 Timothy 2-2 and <f>ⓒ</f>what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses <f>ⓓ</f>entrust to faithful men, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>who will be able to teach others also.
2 Timothy 2-3 <f>ⓕ</f> Share in suffering as <f>ⓖ</f>a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy 2-4 No soldier <f>ⓗ</f>gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.
2 Timothy 2-5 <f>ⓘ</f> An athlete is not <f>ⓙ</f>crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
2 Timothy 2-6 It is <f>ⓚ</f>the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.
2 Timothy 2-7 Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
2 Timothy 2-8 <pb/>Remember Jesus Christ, <f>ⓛ</f>risen from the dead, the <f>ⓜ</f>offspring of David, <f>ⓝ</f>as preached in my gospel,
2 Timothy 2-9 <f>ⓞ</f> for which I am suffering, <f>ⓟ</f>bound with chains as a criminal. But <f>ⓠ</f>the word of God is not bound!
2 Timothy 2-10 Therefore <f>ⓡ</f>I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain <f>ⓢ</f>the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with <f>ⓣ</f>eternal glory.
2 Timothy 2-11 The saying is <f>ⓤ</f>trustworthy, for: <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f>If we have died with him, we will also <f>ⓦ</f>live with him;</t>
2 Timothy 2-12 <t><f>ⓧ</f> if we endure, we will also reign with him; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>if we deny him, he also will deny us;</t>
2 Timothy 2-13 <t><f>ⓩ</f> if we are faithless, <f>ⓐ</f>he remains faithful — </t> <pb/>for <f>ⓑ</f>he cannot deny himself.
2 Timothy 2-14 <pb/>Remind them of these things, and <f>ⓒ</f>charge them before God <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>not to quarrel about words, <f>ⓔ</f>which does no good, but only ruins the hearers.
2 Timothy 2-15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, <f>[3]</f> a worker <f>ⓕ</f>who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
2 Timothy 2-16 But <f>ⓖ</f>avoid <f>ⓗ</f>irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,
2 Timothy 2-17 and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are <f>ⓘ</f>Hymenaeus and Philetus,
2 Timothy 2-18 who have swerved from the truth, <f>ⓙ</f>saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.
2 Timothy 2-19 But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: <f>ⓚ</f>“The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let everyone <f>ⓛ</f>who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”
2 Timothy 2-20 <pb/>Now in <f>ⓜ</f>a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, <f>ⓝ</f>some for honorable use, some for dishonorable.
2 Timothy 2-21 Therefore, <f>ⓞ</f>if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, <f>[4]</f> he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, <f>ⓟ</f>ready for every good work.
2 Timothy 2-22 <pb/>So <f>ⓠ</f>flee <f>ⓡ</f>youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with <f>ⓢ</f>those who call on the Lord <f>ⓣ</f>from a pure heart.
2 Timothy 2-23 Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant <f>ⓤ</f>controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.
2 Timothy 2-24 And <f>ⓥ</f>the Lord's servant <f>[5]</f> must not be quarrelsome but <f>ⓦ</f>kind to everyone, <f>ⓧ</f>able to teach, patiently enduring evil,
2 Timothy 2-25 correcting his opponents <f>ⓨ</f>with gentleness. God <f>ⓩ</f>may perhaps grant them repentance <f>ⓐ</f>leading to a knowledge of the truth,
2 Timothy 2-26 and they may come to their senses and escape from <f>ⓑ</f>the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.
