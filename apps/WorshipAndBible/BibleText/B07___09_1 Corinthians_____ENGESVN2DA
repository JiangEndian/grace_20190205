1 Corinthians 9-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Am I not free? <f>ⓑ</f>Am I not an apostle? <f>ⓒ</f>Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? <f>ⓓ</f>Are not you my workmanship in the Lord?
1 Corinthians 9-2 If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you, for you are <f>ⓔ</f>the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 9-3 <pb/>This is my defense to those who would examine me.
1 Corinthians 9-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
1 Corinthians 9-5 <f>ⓖ</f> Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, <f>[1]</f> as do the other apostles and <f>ⓗ</f>the brothers of the Lord and <f>ⓘ</f>Cephas?
1 Corinthians 9-6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?
1 Corinthians 9-7 <f>ⓙ</f> Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? <f>ⓚ</f>Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
1 Corinthians 9-8 <pb/>Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same?
1 Corinthians 9-9 For it is written in the Law of Moses, <f>ⓛ</f>“You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
1 Corinthians 9-10 Does he not certainly speak for our sake? It was written <f>ⓜ</f>for our sake, because <f>ⓝ</f>the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.
1 Corinthians 9-11 <f>ⓞ</f> If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
1 Corinthians 9-12 If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more? <pb/>Nevertheless, <f>ⓟ</f>we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything <f>ⓠ</f>rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.
1 Corinthians 9-13 Do you not know that <f>ⓡ</f>those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings?
1 Corinthians 9-14 In the same way, the Lord commanded that <f>ⓢ</f>those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
1 Corinthians 9-15 <pb/>But <f>ⓣ</f>I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone <f>ⓤ</f>deprive me of my ground for boasting.
1 Corinthians 9-16 For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For <f>ⓥ</f>necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
1 Corinthians 9-17 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with <f>ⓦ</f>a stewardship.
1 Corinthians 9-18 What then is my reward? That in my preaching <f>ⓧ</f>I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
1 Corinthians 9-19 <pb/>For <f>ⓨ</f>though I am free from all, <f>ⓩ</f>I have made myself a servant to all, that I might <f>ⓐ</f>win more of them.
1 Corinthians 9-20 <f>ⓑ</f> To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law.
1 Corinthians 9-21 To <f>ⓒ</f>those outside the law I became <f>ⓓ</f>as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but <f>ⓔ</f>under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.
1 Corinthians 9-22 <f>ⓕ</f> To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. <f>ⓖ</f>I have become all things to all people, that <f>ⓗ</f>by all means I might save some.
1 Corinthians 9-23 I do it all for the sake of the gospel, <f>ⓘ</f>that I may share with them in its blessings.
1 Corinthians 9-24 <pb/>Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives <f>ⓙ</f>the prize? So <f>ⓚ</f>run that you may obtain it.
1 Corinthians 9-25 Every <f>ⓛ</f>athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we <f>ⓜ</f>an imperishable.
1 Corinthians 9-26 So I do not run aimlessly; I <f>ⓝ</f>do not box as one <f>ⓞ</f>beating the air.
1 Corinthians 9-27 But I discipline my body and <f>ⓟ</f>keep it under control, <f>[2]</f> lest after preaching to others <f>ⓠ</f>I myself should be <f>ⓡ</f>disqualified.
