Ecclesiastes 3-1 <pb/>For everything there is a season, and <f>ⓐ</f>a time for every matter under heaven:
Ecclesiastes 3-2 <pb/><t>a time to be born, and a time to <f>ⓑ</f>die; </t><t>a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-3 <t>a time to kill, and a time to heal; </t><t>a time to break down, and a time to build up;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-4 <t>a time to <f>ⓒ</f>weep, and a time to laugh; </t><t>a time to mourn, and a time to <f>ⓓ</f>dance;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-5 <t>a time to <f>ⓔ</f>cast away stones, and a time to <f>ⓕ</f>gather stones together; </t><t>a time to embrace, and a time to <f>ⓖ</f>refrain from embracing;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-6 <t>a time to seek, and a time to <f>ⓗ</f>lose; </t><t>a time to keep, and a time to <f>ⓘ</f>cast away;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-7 <t>a time to <f>ⓙ</f>tear, and a time to sew; </t><t>a time to <f>ⓚ</f>keep silence, and a time to speak;</t>
Ecclesiastes 3-8 <t>a time to love, and a time to <f>ⓛ</f>hate; </t><t>a time for war, and a time for peace. </t>
Ecclesiastes 3-9 <pb/>What <f>ⓜ</f>gain has the worker from his toil?
Ecclesiastes 3-10 I have seen <f>ⓝ</f>the business that <f>ⓞ</f>God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
Ecclesiastes 3-11 He has <f>ⓟ</f>made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot <f>ⓠ</f>find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
Ecclesiastes 3-12 I perceived that there is <f>ⓡ</f>nothing better for them than to be joyful and to <f>ⓢ</f>do good as long as they live;
Ecclesiastes 3-13 also <f>ⓣ</f>that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil — this is <f>ⓤ</f>God's gift to man.
Ecclesiastes 3-14 <pb/>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; <f>ⓥ</f>nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.
Ecclesiastes 3-15 That which is, <f>ⓦ</f>already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God <f>ⓧ</f>seeks what has been driven away. <f>[1]</f>
Ecclesiastes 3-16 <pb/>Moreover, <f>ⓨ</f>I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even <f>ⓩ</f>there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.
Ecclesiastes 3-17 I said in my heart, <f>ⓐ</f>God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is <f>ⓑ</f>a time for every matter and for every work.
Ecclesiastes 3-18 I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but <f>ⓒ</f>beasts.
Ecclesiastes 3-19 <f>ⓓ</f> For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity. <f>[2]</f>
Ecclesiastes 3-20 All go to one place. All are from <f>ⓔ</f>the dust, and to dust all return.
Ecclesiastes 3-21 Who knows whether <f>ⓕ</f>the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?
Ecclesiastes 3-22 So I saw that there is <f>ⓖ</f>nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for <f>ⓗ</f>that is his lot. Who can bring him to see <f>ⓘ</f>what will be after him?
