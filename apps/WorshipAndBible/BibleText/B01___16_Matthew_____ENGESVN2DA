Matthew 16-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and <f>ⓑ</f>to test him <f>ⓒ</f>they asked him to show them <f>ⓓ</f>a sign from heaven.
Matthew 16-2 He answered them, <f>[1]</f> <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’</J>
Matthew 16-3 <J>And in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ <f>ⓕ</f>You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret <f>ⓖ</f>the signs of the times.</J>
Matthew 16-4 <J><f>ⓗ</f> An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.”</J> So <f>ⓘ</f>he left them and departed.
Matthew 16-5 <pb/>When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread.
Matthew 16-6 Jesus said to them, <J>“Watch and <f>ⓙ</f>beware of <f>ⓚ</f>the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</J>
Matthew 16-7 And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”
Matthew 16-8 But <f>ⓛ</f>Jesus, aware of this, said, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?</J>
Matthew 16-9 <J><f>ⓝ</f> Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember <f>ⓞ</f>the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</J>
Matthew 16-10 <J>Or <f>ⓟ</f>the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</J>
Matthew 16-11 <J>How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? <f>ⓠ</f>Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</J>
Matthew 16-12 <f>ⓡ</f> Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of <f>ⓢ</f>the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew 16-13 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, <J>“Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”</J>
Matthew 16-14 And they said, “Some say <f>ⓤ</f>John the Baptist, others say <f>ⓥ</f>Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
Matthew 16-15 He said to them, <J>“But who do you say that I am?”</J>
Matthew 16-16 Simon Peter replied, <f>ⓦ</f>“You are <f>ⓧ</f>the Christ, <f>ⓨ</f>the Son of <f>ⓩ</f>the living God.”
Matthew 16-17 And Jesus answered him, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“Blessed are you, <f>ⓑ</f>Simon Bar-Jonah! For <f>ⓒ</f>flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, <f>ⓓ</f>but my Father who is in heaven.</J>
Matthew 16-18 <J>And I tell you, <f>ⓔ</f>you are Peter, and <f>ⓕ</f>on this rock <f>[2]</f> I will build my church, and <f>ⓖ</f>the gates of <f>ⓗ</f>hell <f>[3]</f> shall not prevail against it.</J>
Matthew 16-19 <J>I will give you <f>ⓘ</f>the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and <f>ⓙ</f>whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed <f>[4]</f> in heaven.”</J>
Matthew 16-20 <f>ⓚ</f> Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
Matthew 16-21 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that <f>ⓜ</f>he must go to Jerusalem and <f>ⓝ</f>suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on <f>ⓞ</f>the third day be raised.
Matthew 16-22 And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! <f>[5]</f> This shall never happen to you.”
Matthew 16-23 But he turned and said to Peter, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Get behind me, Satan! You are <f>ⓠ</f>a hindrance <f>[6]</f> to me. For you <f>ⓡ</f>are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”</J>
Matthew 16-24 <pb/>Then Jesus told his disciples, <J>“If anyone would come after me, let him <f>ⓢ</f>deny himself and <f>ⓣ</f>take up his cross and follow me.</J>
Matthew 16-25 <J>For <f>ⓤ</f>whoever would save his life <f>[7]</f> will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</J>
Matthew 16-26 <J>For <f>ⓥ</f>what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or <f>ⓦ</f>what shall a man give in return for his soul?</J>
Matthew 16-27 <J><f>ⓧ</f> For the Son of Man is going to come with <f>ⓨ</f>his angels in the glory of his Father, and <f>ⓩ</f>then he will repay each person according to what he has done.</J>
Matthew 16-28 <J>Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not <f>ⓐ</f>taste death <f>ⓑ</f>until they see the Son of Man <f>ⓒ</f>coming in his kingdom.”</J>
