Job 42-1 <pb/>Then Job answered the LORD and said:
Job 42-2 <pb/><t>“I know that you can <f>ⓐ</f>do all things, </t><t>and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.</t>
Job 42-3 <t><f>ⓑ</f> ‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’ </t><t>Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, </t><t>things <f>ⓒ</f>too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</t>
Job 42-4 <t>‘Hear, and I will speak; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>I will question you, and you make it known to me.’</t>
Job 42-5 <t>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, </t><t>but now my eye sees you;</t>
Job 42-6 <t>therefore I despise myself, </t><t>and repent <f>[1]</f> in <f>ⓔ</f>dust and ashes.” </t>
Job 42-7 <pb/>After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz <f>ⓕ</f>the Temanite: “My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
Job 42-8 Now therefore take <f>ⓖ</f>seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and <f>ⓗ</f>offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall <f>ⓘ</f>pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.”
Job 42-9 <f>ⓙ</f> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.
Job 42-10 <pb/>And the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job <f>ⓛ</f>twice as much as he had before.
Job 42-11 Then came to him all his <f>ⓜ</f>brothers and sisters and all who had <f>ⓝ</f>known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they <f>ⓞ</f>showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil <f>[2]</f> that the LORD had brought upon him. And each of them gave him <f>ⓟ</f>a piece of money <f>[3]</f> and <f>ⓠ</f>a ring of gold.
Job 42-12 <pb/>And the LORD blessed <f>ⓡ</f>the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had <f>ⓢ</f>14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
Job 42-13 He had also <f>ⓣ</f>seven sons and three daughters.
Job 42-14 And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch.
Job 42-15 And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance <f>ⓤ</f>among their brothers.
Job 42-16 And after this Job lived 140 years, and <f>ⓥ</f>saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.
Job 42-17 And Job died, an old man, and <f>ⓦ</f>full of days.
