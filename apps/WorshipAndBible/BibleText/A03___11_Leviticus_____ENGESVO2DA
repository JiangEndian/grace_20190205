Leviticus 11-29 <pb/>“And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the ground: the mole rat, <f>ⓟ</f>the mouse, the great lizard of any kind,
Leviticus 11-30 the gecko, the monitor lizard, the lizard, the sand lizard, and the chameleon.
Leviticus 11-31 These are unclean to you among all that swarm. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.
Leviticus 11-32 And anything on which any of them falls when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is an article of wood or a garment or a skin or a sack, any article that is used for any purpose. <f>ⓠ</f>It must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be clean.
Leviticus 11-33 And if any of them falls into any earthenware vessel, all that is in it shall be unclean, and you <f>ⓡ</f>shall break it.
Leviticus 11-34 Any food in it that could be eaten, on which water comes, shall be unclean. And all drink that could be drunk from every such vessel shall be unclean.

Leviticus 11-36 Nevertheless, a spring or a cistern holding water shall be clean, but whoever touches a carcass in them shall be unclean.
Leviticus 11-37 And if any part of their carcass falls upon any seed grain that is to be sown, it is clean,

Leviticus 11-42 Whatever goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, any swarming thing that swarms on the ground, you shall not eat, for they are detestable.
Leviticus 11-43 <f>ⓤ</f> You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms, and you shall not defile yourselves with them, and become unclean through them.
Leviticus 11-44 For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and <f>ⓥ</f>be holy, for I am holy. <f>ⓦ</f>You shall not defile yourselves with any swarming thing that crawls on the ground.
Leviticus 11-45 <f>ⓧ</f> For I am the LORD who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God. <f>ⓨ</f>You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.”
Leviticus 11-46 <pb/>This is the law about beast and bird and every living creature that moves through the waters and every creature that swarms on the ground,
Leviticus 11-47 <f>ⓩ</f> to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten.
