Leviticus 21-1 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, <f>ⓐ</f>No one shall make himself unclean for the dead among his people,
Leviticus 21-2 except for his closest relatives, his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, his brother,
Leviticus 21-3 or his virgin sister (who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may make himself unclean).
Leviticus 21-4 He shall not make himself unclean as a husband among his people and so profane himself.
Leviticus 21-5 <f>ⓑ</f> They shall not make bald patches on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts on their body.
Leviticus 21-6 They shall be holy to their God and <f>ⓒ</f>not profane the name of their God. For they offer the LORD's food offerings, <f>ⓓ</f>the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
Leviticus 21-7 <f>ⓔ</f> They shall not marry a prostitute or a woman who has been defiled, neither shall they marry a woman <f>ⓕ</f>divorced from her husband, for the priest is holy to his God.
Leviticus 21-8 You shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for <f>ⓖ</f>I, the LORD, who sanctify you, <f>ⓗ</f>am holy.
Leviticus 21-9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by whoring, profanes her father; <f>ⓘ</f>she shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus 21-10 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> “The priest who is chief among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, <f>ⓚ</f>shall not let the hair of his head hang loose nor tear his clothes.
Leviticus 21-11 He shall not <f>ⓛ</f>go in to any dead bodies nor make himself unclean, even for his father or for his mother.
Leviticus 21-12 <f>ⓜ</f> He shall not go out of the sanctuary, lest he <f>ⓝ</f>profane the sanctuary of his God, for the <f>ⓞ</f>consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 21-13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity. <f>[1]</f>
Leviticus 21-14 A widow, <f>ⓟ</f>or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute, these he shall not marry. But he shall take as his wife a virgin <f>[2]</f> of his own people,
Leviticus 21-15 that he may not profane his offspring among his people, for <f>ⓠ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies him.”
Leviticus 21-16 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 21-17 “Speak to Aaron, saying, None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a blemish may <f>ⓡ</f>approach to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus 21-18 For no one who has a blemish shall draw near, a man <f>ⓢ</f>blind or lame, or one who has a mutilated face <f>ⓣ</f>or a limb too long,
Leviticus 21-19 or a man who has an injured foot or an injured hand,
Leviticus 21-20 or a hunchback or a dwarf or a man with a <f>ⓤ</f>defect in his sight or an itching disease or scabs or <f>ⓥ</f>crushed testicles.
Leviticus 21-21 No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall come near to <f>ⓦ</f>offer the LORD's food offerings; since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus 21-22 He may eat the bread of his God, both of <f>ⓧ</f>the most holy and of the <f>ⓨ</f>holy things,
Leviticus 21-23 but he shall not go through the veil or approach the altar, because he has a blemish, that he may not <f>ⓩ</f>profane my sanctuaries, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”
Leviticus 21-24 So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the people of Israel.
