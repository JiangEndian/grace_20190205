1 Thessalonians 4-1 <pb/>Finally, then, brothers, <f>[1]</f> we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you <f>ⓐ</f>received from us <f>ⓑ</f>how you ought to walk and <f>ⓒ</f>to please God, just as you are doing, that you <f>ⓓ</f>do so more and more.
1 Thessalonians 4-2 For <f>ⓔ</f>you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians 4-3 For this is the will of God, <f>ⓕ</f>your sanctification: <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>that you abstain from sexual immorality;
1 Thessalonians 4-4 that each one of you know how to control his own <f>ⓗ</f>body <f>[3]</f> in holiness and <f>ⓘ</f>honor,
1 Thessalonians 4-5 not in <f>ⓙ</f>the passion of lust <f>ⓚ</f>like the Gentiles <f>ⓛ</f>who do not know God;
1 Thessalonians 4-6 that no one transgress and <f>ⓜ</f>wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is <f>ⓝ</f>an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you.
1 Thessalonians 4-7 For <f>ⓞ</f>God has not called us for <f>ⓟ</f>impurity, but in holiness.
1 Thessalonians 4-8 Therefore <f>ⓠ</f>whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, <f>ⓡ</f>who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
1 Thessalonians 4-9 <pb/>Now concerning <f>ⓢ</f>brotherly love <f>ⓣ</f>you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been <f>ⓤ</f>taught by God <f>ⓥ</f>to love one another,
1 Thessalonians 4-10 for that indeed is what <f>ⓦ</f>you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to <f>ⓧ</f>do this more and more,
1 Thessalonians 4-11 and to aspire <f>ⓨ</f>to live quietly, and <f>ⓩ</f>to mind your own affairs, and <f>ⓐ</f>to work with your hands, as we instructed you,
1 Thessalonians 4-12 so that you may <f>ⓑ</f>walk properly before <f>ⓒ</f>outsiders and be dependent on no one.
1 Thessalonians 4-13 <pb/>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, <f>ⓓ</f>that you may not grieve as others do <f>ⓔ</f>who have no hope.
1 Thessalonians 4-14 For <f>ⓕ</f>since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him <f>ⓖ</f>those who have fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians 4-15 For this we declare to you <f>ⓗ</f>by a word from the Lord, <f>[4]</f> that <f>ⓘ</f>we who are alive, who are left until <f>ⓙ</f>the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians 4-16 For <f>ⓚ</f>the Lord himself will descend <f>ⓛ</f>from heaven <f>ⓜ</f>with a cry of command, with the voice of <f>ⓝ</f>an archangel, and <f>ⓞ</f>with the sound of the trumpet of God. And <f>ⓟ</f>the dead in Christ will rise first.
1 Thessalonians 4-17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be <f>ⓠ</f>caught up together with them <f>ⓡ</f>in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so <f>ⓢ</f>we will always be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 4-18 Therefore encourage one another with these words.
