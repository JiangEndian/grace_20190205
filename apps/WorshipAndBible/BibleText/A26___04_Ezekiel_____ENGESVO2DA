Ezekiel 4-1 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>take a brick and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem.
Ezekiel 4-2 <f>ⓒ</f> And put siegeworks against it, <f>ⓓ</f>and build a siege wall against it, <f>ⓔ</f>and cast up a mound against it. Set camps also against it, <f>ⓕ</f>and plant battering rams against it all around.
Ezekiel 4-3 And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; <f>ⓖ</f>and set your face toward it, <f>ⓗ</f>and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is <f>ⓘ</f>a sign for the house of Israel.
Ezekiel 4-4 <pb/>“Then lie on your left side, and place the punishment <f>[1]</f> of the house of Israel upon it. For the number of the days that you lie on it, <f>ⓙ</f>you shall bear their punishment.
Ezekiel 4-5 For I assign to you a number of days, <f>ⓚ</f>390 days, <f>ⓛ</f>equal to the number of the years of their punishment. <f>ⓜ</f>So long shall you bear <f>ⓝ</f>the punishment of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel 4-6 And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and <f>ⓞ</f>bear <f>ⓟ</f>the punishment of the house of Judah. <f>ⓠ</f>Forty days I assign you, a day for each year.
Ezekiel 4-7 <f>ⓡ</f> And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, <f>ⓢ</f>with your arm bared, and you shall prophesy against the city.
Ezekiel 4-8 And behold, <f>ⓣ</f>I will place cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed <f>ⓤ</f>the days of your siege.
Ezekiel 4-9 <pb/>“And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and emmer, <f>[2]</f> and put them into a single vessel and make your <f>ⓥ</f>bread from them. <f>ⓦ</f>During the number of days that you lie on your side, <f>ⓧ</f>390 days, you shall eat it.
Ezekiel 4-10 And your food that you eat shall be <f>ⓨ</f>by weight, <f>ⓩ</f>twenty shekels <f>[3]</f> a day; from day to day <f>[4]</f> you shall eat it.
Ezekiel 4-11 And water you shall drink <f>ⓐ</f>by measure, the sixth part of a hin; <f>[5]</f> from day to day you shall drink.
Ezekiel 4-12 And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it <f>ⓑ</f>in their sight on human dung.”
Ezekiel 4-13 And the LORD said, “Thus shall the people of Israel eat <f>ⓒ</f>their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.”
Ezekiel 4-14 Then I said, <f>ⓓ</f>“Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I have never defiled myself. <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>From my youth up till now I have never eaten <f>ⓕ</f>what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has <f>ⓖ</f>tainted meat come into my mouth.”
Ezekiel 4-15 Then he said to me, “See, I assign to you cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread.”
Ezekiel 4-16 Moreover, he said to me, <f>ⓗ</f>“Son of man, behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I will break the supply <f>[7]</f> of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread <f>ⓙ</f>by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water <f>ⓚ</f>by measure and in dismay.
Ezekiel 4-17 I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and <f>ⓛ</f>look at one another in dismay, and <f>ⓜ</f>rot away because of their punishment.
