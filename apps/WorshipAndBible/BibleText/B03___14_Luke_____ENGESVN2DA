Luke 14-1 <pb/>One Sabbath, <f>ⓐ</f>when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were <f>ⓑ</f>watching him carefully.
Luke 14-2 And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy.
Luke 14-3 And Jesus responded to <f>ⓒ</f>the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?”</J>
Luke 14-4 But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away.
Luke 14-5 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Which of you, having a son <f>[1]</f> or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?”</J>
Luke 14-6 <f>ⓕ</f> And they could not reply to these things.
Luke 14-7 <pb/>Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed <f>ⓖ</f>how they chose the places of honor, saying to them,
Luke 14-8 <J>“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him,</J>
Luke 14-9 <J>and he who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Give your place to this person,’ and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.</J>
Luke 14-10 <J>But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, <f>ⓗ</f>so that when your host comes he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you.</J>
Luke 14-11 <J>For <f>ⓘ</f>everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</J>
Luke 14-12 <pb/>He said also to the man who had invited him, <J>“When you give <f>ⓙ</f>a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers <f>[2]</f> or your relatives or rich neighbors, <f>ⓚ</f>lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid.</J>
Luke 14-13 <J>But when you give a feast, <f>ⓛ</f>invite <f>ⓜ</f>the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</J>
Luke 14-14 <J>and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid <f>ⓝ</f>at <f>ⓞ</f>the resurrection of the just.”</J>
Luke 14-15 <pb/>When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, <f>ⓟ</f>“Blessed is everyone who will <f>ⓠ</f>eat bread in the kingdom of God!”
Luke 14-16 But he said to him, <J> <f>ⓡ</f>“A man once <f>ⓢ</f>gave a great banquet and invited many.</J>
Luke 14-17 <J>And at the time for the banquet he <f>ⓣ</f>sent his servant <f>[3]</f> to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’</J>
Luke 14-18 <J>But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.’</J>
Luke 14-19 <J>And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. Please have me excused.’</J>
Luke 14-20 <J>And another said, <f>ⓤ</f>‘I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’</J>
Luke 14-21 <J>So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in <f>ⓥ</f>the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’</J>
Luke 14-22 <J>And the servant said, ‘Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’</J>
Luke 14-23 <J>And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.</J>
Luke 14-24 <J>For I tell you, <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓦ</f>none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.’”</J>
Luke 14-25 <pb/>Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them,
Luke 14-26 <J><f>ⓧ</f> “If anyone comes to me and <f>ⓨ</f>does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, <f>ⓩ</f>yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</J>
Luke 14-27 <J><f>ⓐ</f> Whoever does not <f>ⓑ</f>bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.</J>
Luke 14-28 <J>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not <f>ⓒ</f>first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?</J>
Luke 14-29 <J>Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,</J>
Luke 14-30 <J>saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’</J>
Luke 14-31 <J>Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not <f>ⓓ</f>sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</J>
Luke 14-32 <J>And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.</J>
Luke 14-33 <J><f>ⓔ</f> So therefore, any one of you who <f>ⓕ</f>does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.</J>
Luke 14-34 <pb/><J><f>ⓖ</f> “Salt is good, <f>ⓗ</f>but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?</J>
Luke 14-35 <J>It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile. It is thrown away. <f>ⓘ</f>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</J>
