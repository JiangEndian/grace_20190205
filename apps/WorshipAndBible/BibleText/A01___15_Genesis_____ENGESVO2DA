Genesis 15-1 <pb/>After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: <f>ⓐ</f>“Fear not, Abram, I am <f>ⓑ</f>your shield; your reward shall be very great.”
Genesis 15-2 But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue <f>[1]</f> childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”
Genesis 15-3 And Abram said, “Behold, you have given me no offspring, and <f>ⓒ</f>a member of my household will be my heir.”
Genesis 15-4 And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: “This man shall not be your heir; <f>ⓓ</f>your very own son <f>[2]</f> shall be your heir.”
Genesis 15-5 And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and <f>ⓔ</f>number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, <f>ⓕ</f>“So shall your offspring be.”
Genesis 15-6 And <f>ⓖ</f>he believed the LORD, and <f>ⓗ</f>he counted it to him as righteousness.
Genesis 15-7 <pb/>And he said to him, “I am the LORD who <f>ⓘ</f>brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans <f>ⓙ</f>to give you this land to possess.”
Genesis 15-8 But he said, “O Lord GOD, <f>ⓚ</f>how am I to know that I shall possess it?”
Genesis 15-9 He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”
Genesis 15-10 And he brought him all these, <f>ⓛ</f>cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But <f>ⓜ</f>he did not cut the birds in half.
Genesis 15-11 And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
Genesis 15-12 <pb/>As the sun was going down, a <f>ⓝ</f>deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him.
Genesis 15-13 Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain <f>ⓞ</f>that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and <f>ⓟ</f>they will be afflicted for <f>ⓠ</f>four hundred years.
Genesis 15-14 But <f>ⓡ</f>I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward <f>ⓢ</f>they shall come out with great possessions.
Genesis 15-15 As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; <f>ⓣ</f>you shall be buried in a good old age.
Genesis 15-16 And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for <f>ⓤ</f>the iniquity of the Amorites <f>ⓥ</f>is not yet complete.”
Genesis 15-17 <pb/>When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
Genesis 15-18 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, <f>ⓦ</f>“To your offspring I give <f>[3]</f> this land, from <f>ⓧ</f>the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
Genesis 15-19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
Genesis 15-20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
Genesis 15-21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites.”
