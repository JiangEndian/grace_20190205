John 9-1 <pb/>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
John 9-2 And his disciples asked him, <f>ⓐ</f>“Rabbi, <f>ⓑ</f>who sinned, <f>ⓒ</f>this man or <f>ⓓ</f>his parents, that he was born blind?”
John 9-3 Jesus answered, <J>“It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but <f>ⓔ</f>that the works of God might be displayed in him.</J>
John 9-4 <J>We must <f>ⓕ</f>work the works of him who sent me <f>ⓖ</f>while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.</J>
John 9-5 <J>As long as I am in the world, <f>ⓗ</f>I am the light of the world.”</J>
John 9-6 Having said these things, <f>ⓘ</f>he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. <f>ⓙ</f>Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud
John 9-7 and said to him, <J>“Go, wash in <f>ⓚ</f>the pool of Siloam”</J> (which means Sent). So he went and washed and <f>ⓛ</f>came back seeing.
John 9-8 <pb/>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, <f>ⓜ</f>“Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?”
John 9-9 Some said, “It is he.” Others said, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I am the man.”
John 9-10 So they said to him, “Then how were your eyes opened?”
John 9-11 He answered, <f>ⓝ</f>“The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, <J>‘Go to Siloam and wash.’</J> So I went and washed and received my sight.”
John 9-12 They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”
John 9-13 <pb/>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.
John 9-14 <f>ⓞ</f> Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
John 9-15 <f>ⓟ</f> So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”
John 9-16 Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not <f>ⓠ</f>from God, <f>ⓡ</f>for he does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, <f>ⓢ</f>“How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And <f>ⓣ</f>there was a division among them.
John 9-17 So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?” He said, <f>ⓤ</f>“He is a prophet.”
John 9-18 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> The Jews <f>[1]</f> did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight
John 9-19 and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
John 9-20 His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
John 9-21 But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.”
John 9-22 (His parents said these things <f>ⓦ</f>because they feared the Jews, for <f>ⓧ</f>the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should <f>ⓨ</f>confess Jesus <f>[2]</f> to be Christ, <f>ⓩ</f>he was to be put out of the synagogue.)
John 9-23 Therefore his parents said, <f>ⓐ</f>“He is of age; ask him.”
John 9-24 <pb/>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, <f>ⓑ</f>“Give glory to God. We know that <f>ⓒ</f>this man is a sinner.”
John 9-25 He answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I <f>ⓓ</f>was blind, now I see.”
John 9-26 They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
John 9-27 He answered them, <f>ⓔ</f>“I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?”
John 9-28 And they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but <f>ⓕ</f>we are disciples of Moses.
John 9-29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, <f>ⓖ</f>we do not know where he comes from.”
John 9-30 The man answered, “Why, this is <f>ⓗ</f>an amazing thing! <f>ⓘ</f>You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.
John 9-31 We know that <f>ⓙ</f>God does not listen to sinners, but <f>ⓚ</f>if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.
John 9-32 Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
John 9-33 <f>ⓛ</f> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
John 9-34 They answered him, <f>ⓜ</f>“You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?” And they <f>ⓝ</f>cast him out.
John 9-35 <pb/>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <J>“Do you believe in <f>ⓞ</f>the Son of Man?” <f>[3]</f></J>
John 9-36 He answered, <f>ⓟ</f>“And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?”
John 9-37 Jesus said to him, <J>“You have seen him, and <f>ⓠ</f>it is he who is speaking to you.”</J>
John 9-38 He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
John 9-39 Jesus said, <J> <f>ⓡ</f>“For judgment I came into this world, <f>ⓢ</f>that those who do not see may see, and <f>ⓣ</f>those who see may become blind.”</J>
John 9-40 Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, <f>ⓤ</f>“Are we also blind?”
John 9-41 Jesus said to them, <J>“If you were blind, <f>ⓥ</f>you would have no guilt; <f>[4]</f> but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your guilt remains.</J>
