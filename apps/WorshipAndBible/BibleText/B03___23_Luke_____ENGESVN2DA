Luke 23-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate.
Luke 23-2 And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man <f>ⓑ</f>misleading our nation and <f>ⓒ</f>forbidding us to give tribute to <f>ⓓ</f>Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, <f>ⓔ</f>a king.”
Luke 23-3 <f>ⓕ</f> And Pilate asked him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“You have said so.”</J>
Luke 23-4 Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, <f>ⓘ</f>“I find no guilt in this man.”
Luke 23-5 But they were urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, <f>ⓙ</f>from Galilee even to this place.”
Luke 23-6 <pb/>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
Luke 23-7 And when he learned that he belonged to <f>ⓚ</f>Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.
Luke 23-8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, <f>ⓛ</f>for he had long desired to see him, <f>ⓜ</f>because he had heard about him, and he was hoping <f>ⓝ</f>to see some sign done by him.
Luke 23-9 So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer.
Luke 23-10 The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.
Luke 23-11 And Herod with his soldiers <f>ⓞ</f>treated him with contempt and <f>ⓟ</f>mocked him. Then, <f>ⓠ</f>arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.
Luke 23-12 And <f>ⓡ</f>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.
Luke 23-13 <pb/>Pilate then called together the chief priests and <f>ⓢ</f>the rulers and the people,
Luke 23-14 and said to them, “You brought me this man <f>ⓣ</f>as one who was misleading the people. And <f>ⓤ</f>after examining him before you, behold, I <f>ⓥ</f>did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him.
Luke 23-15 Neither did Herod, for <f>ⓦ</f>he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him.
Luke 23-16 <f>ⓧ</f> I will therefore punish and release him.” <f>[1]</f>
Luke 23-17 
Luke 23-18 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> But they all cried out together, <f>ⓩ</f>“Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas” —
Luke 23-19 a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and <f>ⓐ</f>for murder.
Luke 23-20 Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus,
Luke 23-21 but they kept shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!”
Luke 23-22 A third time he said to them, “Why? <f>ⓑ</f>What evil has he done? <f>ⓒ</f>I have found in him no guilt deserving death. <f>ⓓ</f>I will therefore punish and release him.”
Luke 23-23 But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
Luke 23-24 So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.
Luke 23-25 He released the man who had been thrown into prison <f>ⓔ</f>for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, <f>ⓕ</f>but he delivered Jesus over to their will.
Luke 23-26 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.
Luke 23-27 And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were <f>ⓗ</f>mourning and lamenting for him.
Luke 23-28 But turning to them Jesus said, <J>“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</J>
Luke 23-29 <J>For behold, <f>ⓘ</f>the days are coming when they will say, <f>ⓙ</f>‘Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’</J>
Luke 23-30 <J><f>ⓚ</f> Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’</J>
Luke 23-31 <J>For <f>ⓛ</f>if they do these things when <f>ⓜ</f>the wood is green, what will happen <f>ⓝ</f>when it is dry?”</J>
Luke 23-32 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.
Luke 23-33 <f>ⓟ</f> And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, <f>ⓠ</f>one on his right and one on his left.
Luke 23-34 And Jesus said, <J>“Father, <f>ⓡ</f>forgive them, <f>ⓢ</f>for they know not what they do.” <f>[2]</f></J> And they cast lots <f>ⓣ</f>to divide his garments.
Luke 23-35 And <f>ⓤ</f>the people stood by, watching, <f>ⓥ</f>but <f>ⓦ</f>the rulers <f>ⓧ</f>scoffed at him, saying, <f>ⓨ</f>“He saved others; <f>ⓩ</f>let him save himself, <f>ⓐ</f>if he is <f>ⓑ</f>the Christ of God, <f>ⓒ</f>his Chosen One!”
Luke 23-36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and <f>ⓓ</f>offering him sour wine
Luke 23-37 and saying, <f>ⓔ</f>“If you are <f>ⓕ</f>the King of the Jews, save yourself!”
Luke 23-38 <f>ⓖ</f> There was also an inscription over him, <f>[3]</f> “This is <f>ⓗ</f>the King of the Jews.”
Luke 23-39 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> One of the criminals who were hanged <f>ⓙ</f>railed at him, <f>[4]</f> saying, “Are you not <f>ⓚ</f>the Christ? Save yourself and us!”
Luke 23-40 But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
Luke 23-41 And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.”
Luke 23-42 And he said, “Jesus, remember me <f>ⓛ</f>when you come into your kingdom.”
Luke 23-43 And he said to him, <J>“Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in <f>ⓜ</f>paradise.”</J>
Luke 23-44 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> It was now about the sixth hour, <f>[5]</f> and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, <f>[6]</f>
Luke 23-45 while the sun's light failed. And <f>ⓞ</f>the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
Luke 23-46 Then Jesus, <f>ⓟ</f>calling out with a loud voice, said, <J>“Father, <f>ⓠ</f>into your hands I <f>ⓡ</f>commit my spirit!”</J> And having said this <f>ⓢ</f>he breathed his last.
Luke 23-47 Now <f>ⓣ</f>when the centurion saw what had taken place, <f>ⓤ</f>he praised God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent!”
Luke 23-48 And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home <f>ⓥ</f>beating their breasts.
Luke 23-49 And all <f>ⓦ</f>his acquaintances and <f>ⓧ</f>the women who had followed him from Galilee <f>ⓨ</f>stood at a distance watching these things.
Luke 23-50 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,
Luke 23-51 who had not consented to their decision and action; and he <f>ⓐ</f>was looking for the kingdom of God.
Luke 23-52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke 23-53 Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and <f>ⓑ</f>laid him in a tomb cut in stone, <f>ⓒ</f>where no one had ever yet been laid.
Luke 23-54 It was the day of <f>ⓓ</f>Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning. <f>[7]</f>
Luke 23-55 <f>ⓔ</f> The women <f>ⓕ</f>who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
Luke 23-56 Then they returned and <f>ⓖ</f>prepared spices and ointments. <pb/>On the Sabbath they rested <f>ⓗ</f>according to the commandment.
