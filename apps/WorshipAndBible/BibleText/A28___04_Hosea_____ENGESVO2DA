Hosea 4-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Hear the word of the LORD, O children of Israel, </t><t>for <f>ⓑ</f>the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land. </t><t>There is no faithfulness or steadfast love, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>no knowledge of God in the land;</t>
Hosea 4-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> there is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery; </t><t>they break all bounds, and <f>ⓔ</f>bloodshed follows bloodshed.</t>
Hosea 4-3 <t>Therefore <f>ⓕ</f>the land mourns, </t><t>and all who dwell in it languish, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>and also the beasts of the field </t><t>and the birds of the heavens, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and even the fish of the sea are taken away. </t>
Hosea 4-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Yet let no one contend, </t><t>and let none accuse, </t><t>for with you is <f>ⓙ</f>my contention, O priest. <f>[1]</f></t>
Hosea 4-5 <t>You shall stumble by day; </t><t>the prophet also shall stumble with you by night; </t><t>and I will destroy <f>ⓚ</f>your mother.</t>
Hosea 4-6 <t>My people are destroyed <f>ⓛ</f>for lack of knowledge; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>because you have rejected knowledge, </t><t>I reject you <f>ⓝ</f>from being a priest to me. </t><t>And since you have forgotten the law of your God, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>I also will forget your children. </t>
Hosea 4-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> The more they increased, </t><t>the more they sinned against me; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>I will change their glory into shame.</t>
Hosea 4-8 <t><f>ⓡ</f> They feed on the sin <f>[2]</f> of my people; </t><t>they are greedy for their iniquity.</t>
Hosea 4-9 <t><f>ⓢ</f> And it shall be like people, like priest; </t><t>I will punish them for their ways </t><t>and repay them for their deeds.</t>
Hosea 4-10 <t><f>ⓣ</f> They shall eat, but not be satisfied; </t><t>they shall play the whore, but not multiply, </t><t>because they have forsaken the LORD </t><t>to cherish </t>
Hosea 4-11 <t>whoredom, wine, and new wine, </t><t>which <f>ⓤ</f>take away the understanding.</t>
Hosea 4-12 <t>My people <f>ⓥ</f>inquire of a piece of wood, </t><t>and their walking staff gives them oracles. </t><t>For <f>ⓦ</f>a spirit of whoredom has led them astray, </t><t>and they have left their God to play the whore.</t>
Hosea 4-13 <t><f>ⓧ</f> They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains </t><t>and burn offerings on the hills, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>under oak, poplar, and terebinth, </t><t>because their shade is good. </t><t>Therefore your daughters play the whore, </t><t>and your brides commit adultery.</t>
Hosea 4-14 <t>I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore, </t><t>nor your brides when they commit adultery; </t><t>for <f>ⓩ</f>the men themselves go aside with prostitutes </t><t>and sacrifice with <f>ⓐ</f>cult prostitutes, </t><t>and a people <f>ⓑ</f>without understanding shall come to ruin. </t>
Hosea 4-15 <pb/><t>Though you play the whore, O <f>ⓒ</f>Israel, </t><t>let not <f>ⓓ</f>Judah become guilty. </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>Enter not into <f>ⓕ</f>Gilgal, </t><t>nor go up to <f>ⓖ</f>Beth-aven, </t><t>and swear not, “As the LORD lives.”</t>
Hosea 4-16 <t>Like a stubborn heifer, </t><t>Israel is stubborn; </t><t>can the LORD now feed them </t><t>like a lamb in a broad pasture? </t>
Hosea 4-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> Ephraim is joined to idols; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>leave him alone.</t>
Hosea 4-18 <t>When their drink is gone, they give themselves to whoring; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>their rulers <f>[3]</f> dearly love shame.</t>
Hosea 4-19 <t><f>ⓚ</f> A wind has wrapped them <f>[4]</f> in its wings, </t><t>and they shall <f>ⓛ</f>be ashamed because of their sacrifices. </t>
