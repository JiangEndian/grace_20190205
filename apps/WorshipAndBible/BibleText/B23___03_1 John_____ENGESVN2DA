1 John 3-1 <pb/>See <f>ⓐ</f>what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called <f>ⓑ</f>children of God; and so we are. The reason why <f>ⓒ</f>the world does not know us is that <f>ⓓ</f>it did not know him.
1 John 3-2 Beloved, we are <f>ⓔ</f>God's children <f>ⓕ</f>now, and what we will be <f>ⓖ</f>has not yet appeared; but we know that <f>ⓗ</f>when he appears <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>we shall be like him, because <f>ⓙ</f>we shall see him as he is.
1 John 3-3 And everyone who <f>ⓚ</f>thus hopes in him <f>ⓛ</f>purifies himself as he is pure.
1 John 3-4 <pb/>Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; <f>ⓜ</f>sin is lawlessness.
1 John 3-5 You know that <f>ⓝ</f>he appeared in order to <f>ⓞ</f>take away sins, and <f>ⓟ</f>in him there is no sin.
1 John 3-6 No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; <f>ⓠ</f>no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.
1 John 3-7 Little children, <f>ⓡ</f>let no one deceive you. <f>ⓢ</f>Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.
1 John 3-8 <f>ⓣ</f> Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was <f>ⓤ</f>to destroy the works of the devil.
1 John 3-9 <f>ⓥ</f> No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's <f>[2]</f> seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God.
1 John 3-10 By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, <f>ⓦ</f>nor is the one who <f>ⓧ</f>does not love his brother.
1 John 3-11 <pb/>For <f>ⓨ</f>this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, <f>ⓩ</f>that we should love one another.
1 John 3-12 We should not be like <f>ⓐ</f>Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? <f>ⓑ</f>Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous.
1 John 3-13 Do not be surprised, brothers, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>that the world hates you.
1 John 3-14 We know that <f>ⓓ</f>we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death.
1 John 3-15 <f>ⓔ</f> Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that <f>ⓕ</f>no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
1 John 3-16 <pb/>By this we know love, that <f>ⓖ</f>he laid down his life for us, and <f>ⓗ</f>we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
1 John 3-17 But <f>ⓘ</f>if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet <f>ⓙ</f>closes his heart against him, <f>ⓚ</f>how does God's love abide in him?
1 John 3-18 Little children, let us not <f>ⓛ</f>love in word or talk but in deed and <f>ⓜ</f>in truth.
1 John 3-19 <pb/>By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him;
1 John 3-20 for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything.
1 John 3-21 Beloved, <f>ⓝ</f>if our heart does not condemn us, <f>ⓞ</f>we have confidence before God;
1 John 3-22 and <f>ⓟ</f>whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and <f>ⓠ</f>do what pleases him.
1 John 3-23 And this is his commandment, <f>ⓡ</f>that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and <f>ⓢ</f>love one another, <f>ⓣ</f>just as he has commanded us.
1 John 3-24 <f>ⓤ</f> Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, <f>[4]</f> and God <f>[5]</f> in him. And <f>ⓥ</f>by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.
