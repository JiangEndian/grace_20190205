Amos 2-7 <t>those who trample the head of the poor <f>ⓝ</f>into the dust of the earth </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>turn aside the way of the afflicted; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>a man and his father go in to the same girl, </t><t>so that my holy name is profaned;</t>
Amos 2-8 <t>they lay themselves down beside every altar </t><t>on garments <f>ⓠ</f>taken in pledge, </t><t>and in the house of their God they drink </t><t>the wine of those who have been fined. </t>

Amos 2-14 <t><f>ⓐ</f> Flight shall perish from the swift, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>and the strong shall not retain his strength, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>nor shall the mighty save his life;</t>
Amos 2-15 <t>he who handles the bow shall not stand, </t><t>and he who is <f>ⓓ</f>swift of foot shall not save himself, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>nor shall he who rides the horse save his life;</t>
Amos 2-16 <t>and he who is stout of heart among the mighty </t><t>shall flee away naked in that day,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
