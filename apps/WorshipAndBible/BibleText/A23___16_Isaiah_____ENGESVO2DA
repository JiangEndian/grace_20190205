Isaiah 16-1 <pb/><t><pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Send the lamb to the ruler of the land, </t><t>from <f>ⓑ</f>Sela, by way of the desert, </t><t>to the mount of the daughter of Zion.</t>
Isaiah 16-2 <t>Like fleeing birds, </t><t>like a scattered nest, </t><t>so are the daughters of Moab </t><t>at <f>ⓒ</f>the fords of the Arnon. </t>
Isaiah 16-3 <pb/><t>“Give counsel; </t><t>grant justice; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>make your shade like night </t><t>at the height of noon; </t><t>shelter the outcasts; </t><t>do not reveal the fugitive;</t>
Isaiah 16-4 <t>let <f>ⓔ</f>the outcasts of Moab </t><t>sojourn among you; </t><t>be a shelter to them <f>[1]</f> </t><t>from the destroyer. </t><t>When the oppressor is no more, </t><t>and destruction has ceased, </t><t>and he who tramples underfoot has vanished from the land,</t>
Isaiah 16-5 <t><f>ⓕ</f> then a throne will be established in steadfast love, </t><t>and on it will sit in faithfulness </t><t>in the tent of David </t><t>one who judges and seeks justice </t><t>and is swift to do righteousness.” </t>
Isaiah 16-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> We have heard of the pride of Moab — </t><t>how proud he is! — </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>of his arrogance, his pride, and his insolence; </t><t>in his idle boasting he is not right.</t>
Isaiah 16-7 <t>Therefore let Moab wail for Moab, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>let everyone wail. </t><t>Mourn, utterly stricken, </t><t>for the <f>ⓙ</f>raisin cakes of <f>ⓚ</f>Kir-hareseth. </t>
Isaiah 16-8 <pb/><t>For the fields of Heshbon languish, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>the vine of Sibmah; </t><t>the lords of the nations </t><t>have struck down its branches, </t><t>which reached to Jazer </t><t>and strayed to the desert; </t><t>its shoots spread abroad </t><t>and passed over the sea.</t>
Isaiah 16-9 <t>Therefore <f>ⓜ</f>I weep with <f>ⓝ</f>the weeping of Jazer </t><t>for the vine of Sibmah; </t><t>I drench you with my tears, </t><t>O Heshbon and Elealeh; </t><t>for over <f>ⓞ</f>your summer fruit and your harvest </t><t>the shout has ceased.</t>
Isaiah 16-10 <t><f>ⓟ</f> And joy and gladness are taken away from <f>ⓠ</f>the fruitful field, </t><t>and in the vineyards no <f>ⓡ</f>songs are sung, </t><t>no cheers are raised; </t><t>no <f>ⓢ</f>treader treads out wine <f>ⓣ</f>in the presses; </t><t>I have put an end to the shouting.</t>
Isaiah 16-11 <t>Therefore <f>ⓤ</f>my inner parts moan like a lyre for Moab, </t><t>and my inmost self for Kir-hareseth. </t>
Isaiah 16-12 <pb/>And when Moab presents himself, when <f>ⓥ</f>he wearies himself on <f>ⓦ</f>the high place, when he comes to his sanctuary to pray, he will not prevail.
Isaiah 16-13 <pb/>This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab <f>ⓧ</f>in the past.
Isaiah 16-14 But now the LORD has spoken, saying, “In three years, <f>ⓨ</f>like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, in spite of all his great multitude, and those who remain will be <f>ⓩ</f>very few and feeble.”
