Matthew 20-1 <pb/><J>“For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</J>
Matthew 20-2 <J>After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius <f>[1]</f> a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</J>
Matthew 20-3 <J>And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</J>
Matthew 20-4 <J>and to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.’</J>
Matthew 20-5 <J>So they went.</J> <J>Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same.</J>
Matthew 20-6 <J>And <f>ⓐ</f>about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, ‘Why do you stand here idle all day?’</J>
Matthew 20-7 <J>They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’</J>
Matthew 20-8 <J>And <f>ⓑ</f>when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his <f>ⓒ</f>foreman, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.’</J>
Matthew 20-9 <J>And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius.</J>
Matthew 20-10 <J>Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.</J>
Matthew 20-11 <J>And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house,</J>
Matthew 20-12 <J>saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and <f>ⓓ</f>the scorching heat.’</J>
Matthew 20-13 <J>But he replied to one of them, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</J>
Matthew 20-14 <J>Take <f>ⓕ</f>what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you.</J>
Matthew 20-15 <J><f>ⓖ</f> Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or <f>ⓗ</f>do you begrudge my generosity?’ <f>[2]</f></J>
Matthew 20-16 <J>So <f>ⓘ</f>the last will be first, and the first last.”</J>
Matthew 20-17 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
Matthew 20-18 <J>“See, <f>ⓚ</f>we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will <f>ⓛ</f>condemn him to death</J>
Matthew 20-19 <J>and <f>ⓜ</f>deliver him over to the Gentiles <f>ⓝ</f>to be mocked and flogged and <f>ⓞ</f>crucified, and he will be raised on <f>ⓟ</f>the third day.”</J>
Matthew 20-20 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then <f>ⓡ</f>the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and <f>ⓢ</f>kneeling before him she asked him for something.
Matthew 20-21 And he said to her, <J>“What do you want?”</J> She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine <f>ⓣ</f>are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, <f>ⓤ</f>in your kingdom.”
Matthew 20-22 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“You do not know what you are asking. Are you able <f>ⓦ</f>to drink the cup that I am to drink?”</J> They said to him, “We are able.”
Matthew 20-23 He said to them, <J> <f>ⓧ</f>“You will drink <f>ⓨ</f>my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, <f>ⓩ</f>but it is for those for whom it has been <f>ⓐ</f>prepared by my Father.”</J>
Matthew 20-24 And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers.
Matthew 20-25 But Jesus called them to him and said, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles <f>ⓒ</f>lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</J>
Matthew 20-26 <J><f>ⓓ</f> It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, <f>[3]</f></J>
Matthew 20-27 <J>and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, <f>[4]</f></J>
Matthew 20-28 <J>even as the Son of Man came not to be served but <f>ⓔ</f>to serve, and <f>ⓕ</f>to give his life as a ransom for <f>ⓖ</f>many.”</J>
Matthew 20-29 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
Matthew 20-30 And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, <f>[5]</f> have mercy on us, <f>ⓘ</f>Son of David!”
Matthew 20-31 The crowd <f>ⓙ</f>rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
Matthew 20-32 And stopping, Jesus called them and said, <J>“What do you want me to do for you?”</J>
Matthew 20-33 They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”
Matthew 20-34 And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him.
