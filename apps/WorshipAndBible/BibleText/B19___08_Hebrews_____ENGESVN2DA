Hebrews 8-1 <pb/>Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, <f>ⓐ</f>one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
Hebrews 8-2 a minister in the holy places, in <f>ⓑ</f>the true tent <f>[1]</f> that the Lord <f>ⓒ</f>set up, not man.
Hebrews 8-3 For <f>ⓓ</f>every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus <f>ⓔ</f>it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
Hebrews 8-4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.
Hebrews 8-5 They serve <f>ⓕ</f>a copy and <f>ⓖ</f>shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, <f>ⓗ</f>“See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”
Hebrews 8-6 But as it is, Christ <f>[2]</f> has obtained a ministry that is <f>ⓘ</f>as much more excellent than the old as <f>ⓙ</f>the covenant <f>ⓚ</f>he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.
Hebrews 8-7 <f>ⓛ</f> For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.
Hebrews 8-8 <pb/>For he finds fault with them when he says: <f>[3]</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, </t><t>when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel </t><t>and with the house of Judah,</t>
Hebrews 8-9 <t>not like the covenant that I made with their fathers </t><t>on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. </t><t>For they did not continue in my covenant, </t><t>and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.</t>
Hebrews 8-10 <t><f>ⓝ</f> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel </t><t>after those days, declares the Lord: </t><t>I will put my laws into their minds, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>write them on their hearts, </t><t>and I will be their God, </t><t>and they shall be my people.</t>
Hebrews 8-11 <t>And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor </t><t>and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ </t><t>for they shall <f>ⓟ</f>all know me, </t><t>from the least of them to the greatest.</t>
Hebrews 8-12 <t>For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and I will remember their sins no more.” </t>
Hebrews 8-13 <pb/>In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And <f>ⓡ</f>what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
