James 4-1 <pb/>What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions <f>[1]</f> are <f>ⓐ</f>at war within you? <f>[2]</f>
James 4-2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.
James 4-3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask <f>ⓑ</f>wrongly, to spend it on your passions.
James 4-4 <f>ⓒ</f> You adulterous people! <f>[3]</f> Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? <f>ⓓ</f>Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
James 4-5 Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit <f>ⓔ</f>that he has made to dwell in us”?
James 4-6 But <f>ⓕ</f>he gives more grace. Therefore it says, <f>ⓖ</f>“God opposes the proud but <f>ⓗ</f>gives grace to the humble.”
James 4-7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. <f>ⓘ</f>Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
James 4-8 <f>ⓙ</f> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. <f>ⓚ</f>Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and <f>ⓛ</f>purify your hearts, <f>ⓜ</f>you double-minded.
James 4-9 <f>ⓝ</f> Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
James 4-10 <f>ⓞ</f> Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
James 4-11 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. <f>[4]</f> The one who speaks against a brother or <f>ⓠ</f>judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
James 4-12 There is only <f>ⓡ</f>one lawgiver and <f>ⓢ</f>judge, he who is able to save and <f>ⓣ</f>to destroy. But <f>ⓤ</f>who are you to judge your neighbor?
James 4-13 <pb/>Come now, you who say, <f>ⓥ</f>“Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit” —
James 4-14 yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For <f>ⓦ</f>you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.
James 4-15 Instead you ought to say, <f>ⓧ</f>“If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”
James 4-16 As it is, you boast in your arrogance. <f>ⓨ</f>All such boasting is evil.
James 4-17 <f>ⓩ</f> So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.
