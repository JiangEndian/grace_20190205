Matthew 14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> At that time <f>ⓑ</f>Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus,
Matthew 14-2 and he said to his servants, <f>ⓒ</f>“This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.”
Matthew 14-3 For <f>ⓓ</f>Herod had seized John and bound him and <f>ⓔ</f>put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, <f>[1]</f>
Matthew 14-4 because John had been saying to him, <f>ⓕ</f>“It is not lawful for you to have her.”
Matthew 14-5 And though he wanted to put him to death, <f>ⓖ</f>he feared the people, because they held him to be <f>ⓗ</f>a prophet.
Matthew 14-6 But when Herod's <f>ⓘ</f>birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod,
Matthew 14-7 so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
Matthew 14-8 Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”
Matthew 14-9 And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given.
Matthew 14-10 He sent and had John beheaded in the prison,
Matthew 14-11 and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew 14-12 And <f>ⓙ</f>his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.
Matthew 14-13 <pb/>Now when Jesus heard this, <f>ⓚ</f>he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
Matthew 14-14 When he went ashore he <f>ⓛ</f>saw a great crowd, and <f>ⓜ</f>he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
Matthew 14-15 Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; <f>ⓝ</f>send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”
Matthew 14-16 But Jesus said, <J>“They need not go away; <f>ⓞ</f>you give them something to eat.”</J>
Matthew 14-17 They said to him, “We have only five loaves here and two fish.”
Matthew 14-18 And he said, <J>“Bring them here to me.”</J>
Matthew 14-19 Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, <f>ⓟ</f>he looked up to heaven and <f>ⓠ</f>said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
Matthew 14-20 And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
Matthew 14-21 And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew 14-22 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Immediately he <f>ⓢ</f>made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
Matthew 14-23 And after he had dismissed the crowds, <f>ⓣ</f>he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When <f>ⓤ</f>evening came, he was there alone,
Matthew 14-24 but the boat by this time was a long way <f>[2]</f> from the land, <f>[3]</f> beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.
Matthew 14-25 And <f>ⓥ</f>in the fourth watch of the night <f>[4]</f> he came to them, walking on the sea.
Matthew 14-26 But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, <f>ⓦ</f>they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear.
Matthew 14-27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <J> <f>ⓧ</f>“Take heart; it is I. <f>ⓨ</f>Do not be afraid.”</J>
Matthew 14-28 <pb/>And Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”
Matthew 14-29 He said, <J>“Come.”</J> So Peter got out of the boat and <f>ⓩ</f>walked on the water and came to Jesus.
Matthew 14-30 But when he saw the wind, <f>[5]</f> he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, <f>ⓐ</f>“Lord, save me.”
Matthew 14-31 Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“O you of little faith, why did you <f>ⓒ</f>doubt?”</J>
Matthew 14-32 And when they got into the boat, <f>ⓓ</f>the wind ceased.
Matthew 14-33 And <f>ⓔ</f>those in the boat <f>ⓕ</f>worshiped him, saying, <f>ⓖ</f>“Truly you are <f>ⓗ</f>the Son of God.”
Matthew 14-34 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> And when they had crossed over, they came to land at <f>ⓙ</f>Gennesaret.
Matthew 14-35 And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and <f>ⓚ</f>brought to him all who were sick
Matthew 14-36 and implored him that they might only touch <f>ⓛ</f>the fringe of his garment. And <f>ⓜ</f>as many as touched it were made well.
