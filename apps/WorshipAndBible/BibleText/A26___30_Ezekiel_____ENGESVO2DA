Ezekiel 30-5 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Cush, and <f>ⓛ</f>Put, and Lud, and <f>ⓜ</f>all Arabia, and Libya, <f>[3]</f> and the people of the land that is in league, <f>[4]</f> shall fall with them by the sword.
Ezekiel 30-6 <pb/><t>“Thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>Those who support Egypt shall fall, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>her proud might shall come down; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>from Migdol to Syene </t><t>they shall fall within her by the sword, </t><t>declares the Lord GOD.</t>

Ezekiel 30-8 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Then they will know that I am the LORD, </t><t>when <f>ⓢ</f>I have set fire to Egypt, </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>all her helpers are broken. </t>
Ezekiel 30-9 <pb/>“On that day <f>ⓤ</f>messengers shall go out from me in ships to terrify the unsuspecting <f>ⓥ</f>people of Cush, and <f>ⓦ</f>anguish shall come upon them on the day of Egypt's doom; <f>[5]</f> for, behold, it comes!
Ezekiel 30-10 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f>“I will put an end to the wealth of Egypt, </t><t>by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.</t>
Ezekiel 30-11 <t>He and his people with him, <f>ⓨ</f>the most ruthless of nations, </t><t>shall be brought in to destroy the land, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>and they shall draw their swords against Egypt </t><t>and fill the land with the slain.</t>
Ezekiel 30-12 <t>And <f>ⓐ</f>I will <f>ⓑ</f>dry up the Nile </t><t>and will sell the land into the hand of <f>ⓒ</f>evildoers; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it, </t><t>by the hand of <f>ⓔ</f>foreigners; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>I am the LORD; I have spoken. </t>
Ezekiel 30-13 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“I will destroy the idols </t><t>and put an end to the images in <f>ⓗ</f>Memphis; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>there shall no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt; </t><t>so <f>ⓙ</f>I will put fear in the land of Egypt.</t>

Ezekiel 30-19 <t>Thus <f>ⓢ</f>I will execute judgments on Egypt. </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>Then they will know that I am the LORD.” </t>
Ezekiel 30-20 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 30-21 <f>ⓥ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓦ</f>I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and behold, <f>ⓧ</f>it has not been bound up, to heal it by binding it with a bandage, so that it may become strong to wield the sword.
Ezekiel 30-22 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and <f>ⓨ</f>will break his arms, both the strong arm and the one that was broken, and I will make the sword fall from his hand.
Ezekiel 30-23 <f>ⓩ</f> I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel 30-24 And <f>ⓐ</f>I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put <f>ⓑ</f>my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him <f>ⓒ</f>like a man mortally wounded.
Ezekiel 30-25 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall. <f>ⓓ</f>Then they shall know that I am the LORD, <f>ⓔ</f>when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel 30-26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
