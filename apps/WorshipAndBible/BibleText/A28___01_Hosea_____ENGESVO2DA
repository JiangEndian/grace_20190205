Hosea 1-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, <f>ⓐ</f>in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of <f>ⓑ</f>Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
Hosea 1-2 <pb/>When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, <f>ⓒ</f>“Go, take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have <f>ⓓ</f>children of whoredom, for <f>ⓔ</f>the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD.”
Hosea 1-3 So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
Hosea 1-4 <pb/>And the LORD said to him, “Call his name Jezreel, for in just a little while <f>ⓕ</f>I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and <f>ⓖ</f>I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
Hosea 1-5 And on that day <f>ⓗ</f>I will break the bow of Israel <f>ⓘ</f>in the Valley of Jezreel.”
Hosea 1-6 <pb/>She conceived again and bore a daughter. And the LORD said to him, <f>ⓙ</f>“Call her name No Mercy, <f>[1]</f> for <f>ⓚ</f>I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, to forgive them at all.
Hosea 1-7 But <f>ⓛ</f>I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the LORD their God. I <f>ⓜ</f>will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen.”
Hosea 1-8 <pb/>When she had weaned No Mercy, she conceived and bore a son.
Hosea 1-9 And the LORD said, <f>ⓝ</f>“Call his name Not My People, <f>[2]</f> for <f>ⓞ</f>you are not my people, and I am not your God.” <f>[3]</f>
Hosea 1-10 <pb/><f>[4]</f> Yet <f>ⓟ</f>the number of the children of Israel shall be <f>ⓠ</f>like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. <f>ⓡ</f>And <f>ⓢ</f>in the place where it was said to them, <f>ⓣ</f>“You are not my people,” it shall be said to them, <f>ⓤ</f>“Children <f>[5]</f> of <f>ⓥ</f>the living God.”
Hosea 1-11 And <f>ⓦ</f>the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and <f>ⓧ</f>they shall appoint for themselves one head. And they shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
