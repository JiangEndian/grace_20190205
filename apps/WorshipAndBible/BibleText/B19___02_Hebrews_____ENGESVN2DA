Hebrews 2-1 <pb/>Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.
Hebrews 2-2 For since <f>ⓐ</f>the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and <f>ⓑ</f>every transgression or disobedience received a just <f>ⓒ</f>retribution,
Hebrews 2-3 <f>ⓓ</f> how shall we escape if we <f>ⓔ</f>neglect such a great salvation? It was <f>ⓕ</f>declared at first by the Lord, and it was <f>ⓖ</f>attested to us <f>ⓗ</f>by those who heard,
Hebrews 2-4 <f>ⓘ</f> while God also bore witness <f>ⓙ</f>by signs and wonders and various miracles and by <f>ⓚ</f>gifts of the Holy Spirit <f>ⓛ</f>distributed according to his will.
Hebrews 2-5 <pb/>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world <f>ⓜ</f>to come, of which we are speaking.
Hebrews 2-6 It has been testified somewhere, <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“What is man, that you are mindful of him, </t><t>or the son of man, that you care for him?</t>
Hebrews 2-7 <t>You made him for a little while lower than the angels; </t><t>you have crowned him with glory and honor, <f>[1]</f></t>
Hebrews 2-8 <t>putting everything in subjection under his feet.” </t> <pb/>Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, <f>ⓞ</f>we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.
Hebrews 2-9 But we see him <f>ⓟ</f>who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, <f>ⓠ</f>crowned with glory and honor <f>ⓡ</f>because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might <f>ⓢ</f>taste death <f>ⓣ</f>for everyone.
Hebrews 2-10 <pb/>For it <f>ⓤ</f>was fitting that he, <f>ⓥ</f>for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons <f>ⓦ</f>to glory, should make the <f>ⓧ</f>founder of their salvation <f>ⓨ</f>perfect through suffering.
Hebrews 2-11 For <f>ⓩ</f>he who sanctifies and <f>ⓐ</f>those who are sanctified <f>ⓑ</f>all have one source. <f>[2]</f> That is why he is not ashamed to call them <f>ⓒ</f>brothers, <f>[3]</f>
Hebrews 2-12 saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“I will tell of your name to my brothers; </t><t>in the midst of the <f>ⓔ</f>congregation I will sing your praise.” </t>
Hebrews 2-13 <pb/>And again, <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f>“I will put my trust in him.” </t> <pb/>And again, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“Behold, I and the children <f>ⓗ</f>God has given me.” </t>
Hebrews 2-14 <pb/>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise <f>ⓘ</f>partook of the same things, that <f>ⓙ</f>through death he might <f>ⓚ</f>destroy <f>ⓛ</f>the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
Hebrews 2-15 and deliver all those who <f>ⓜ</f>through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
Hebrews 2-16 For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he <f>ⓝ</f>helps the offspring of Abraham.
Hebrews 2-17 Therefore he had <f>ⓞ</f>to be made like his brothers in every respect, <f>ⓟ</f>so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest <f>ⓠ</f>in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
Hebrews 2-18 For because he himself has suffered <f>ⓡ</f>when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
