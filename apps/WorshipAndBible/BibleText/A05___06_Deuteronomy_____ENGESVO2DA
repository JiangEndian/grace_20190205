Deuteronomy 6-11 and houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant — and when you eat and are full,
Deuteronomy 6-12 <f>ⓛ</f> then take care lest you forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

Deuteronomy 6-15 for <f>ⓠ</f>the LORD your God in your midst <f>ⓡ</f>is a jealous God — <f>ⓢ</f>lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.

Deuteronomy 6-22 And <f>ⓐ</f>the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and grievous, against Egypt and against Pharaoh and all his household, before our eyes.
Deuteronomy 6-23 And he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in and give us the land that he swore to give to our fathers.
Deuteronomy 6-24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, <f>ⓑ</f>to fear the LORD our God, <f>ⓒ</f>for our good always, that <f>ⓓ</f>he might preserve us alive, as we are this day.
Deuteronomy 6-25 And <f>ⓔ</f>it will be righteousness for us, if we are careful to do all this commandment before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.’
