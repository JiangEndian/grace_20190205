Daniel 12-1 <pb/>“At that time shall arise <f>ⓐ</f>Michael, the great prince who has charge of your people. And <f>ⓑ</f>there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time. But at that time your people shall be delivered, <f>ⓒ</f>everyone whose name shall be found written in the book.
Daniel 12-2 And many of those who <f>ⓓ</f>sleep in <f>ⓔ</f>the dust of the earth shall <f>ⓕ</f>awake, <f>ⓖ</f>some to everlasting life, and <f>ⓗ</f>some to shame and everlasting contempt.
Daniel 12-3 <f>ⓘ</f> And those who are wise <f>ⓙ</f>shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓚ</f>those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.
Daniel 12-4 But you, Daniel, <f>ⓛ</f>shut up the words and <f>ⓜ</f>seal the book, until <f>ⓝ</f>the time of the end. <f>ⓞ</f>Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.”
Daniel 12-5 <pb/>Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others stood, one on <f>ⓟ</f>this bank of the stream and one on that bank of the stream.
Daniel 12-6 And someone said to <f>ⓠ</f>the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>“How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?”
Daniel 12-7 And I heard <f>ⓢ</f>the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the stream; <f>ⓣ</f>he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and <f>ⓤ</f>swore by him who lives forever that it would be for a <f>ⓥ</f>time, times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of <f>ⓦ</f>the power of <f>ⓧ</f>the holy people comes to an end all these things would be finished.
Daniel 12-8 I heard, <f>ⓨ</f>but I did not understand. Then I said, “O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?”
Daniel 12-9 He said, <f>ⓩ</f>“Go your way, Daniel, <f>ⓐ</f>for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end.
Daniel 12-10 <f>ⓑ</f> Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but <f>ⓒ</f>the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, <f>ⓓ</f>but those who are wise shall understand.
Daniel 12-11 And from the time that <f>ⓔ</f>the regular burnt offering is taken away and <f>ⓕ</f>the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be 1,290 days.
Daniel 12-12 <f>ⓖ</f> Blessed is he who waits and arrives at the 1,335 days.
Daniel 12-13 <f>ⓗ</f> But go your way till the end. <f>ⓘ</f>And you shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at <f>ⓙ</f>the end of the days.”
