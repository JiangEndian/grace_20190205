Revelation 6-1 <pb/>Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of <f>ⓐ</f>the seven seals, and I heard <f>ⓑ</f>one of the four living creatures say <f>ⓒ</f>with a voice like thunder, <f>ⓓ</f>“Come!”

Revelation 6-6 And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“A quart <f>[1]</f> of wheat for a denarius, <f>[2]</f> and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and <f>ⓞ</f>do not harm the oil and wine!”

Revelation 6-13 and <f>ⓙ</f>the stars of the sky fell to the earth <f>ⓚ</f>as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.
