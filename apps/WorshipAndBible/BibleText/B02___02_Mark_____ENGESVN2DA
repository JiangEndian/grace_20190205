Mark 2-1 <pb/>And when he returned to <f>ⓐ</f>Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.
Mark 2-2 And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them.
Mark 2-3 <f>ⓑ</f> And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.
Mark 2-4 And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, <f>ⓒ</f>they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
Mark 2-5 And when Jesus <f>ⓓ</f>saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <J>“Son, <f>ⓔ</f>your sins are forgiven.”</J>
Mark 2-6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,
Mark 2-7 “Why does this man speak like that? <f>ⓕ</f>He is blaspheming! <f>ⓖ</f>Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
Mark 2-8 And immediately Jesus, <f>ⓗ</f>perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <J>“Why do you question these things in your hearts?</J>
Mark 2-9 <J>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’?</J>
Mark 2-10 <J>But that you may know that <f>ⓘ</f>the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</J> — he said to the paralytic —
Mark 2-11 <J>“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.”</J>
Mark 2-12 And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and <f>ⓙ</f>glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”
Mark 2-13 <pb/>He went out again beside the sea, and <f>ⓚ</f>all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them.
Mark 2-14 <f>ⓛ</f> And as he passed by, he saw <f>ⓜ</f>Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, <J>“Follow me.”</J> And he rose and followed him.
Mark 2-15 <pb/>And as he reclined at table in his house, many <f>ⓝ</f>tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
Mark 2-16 And <f>ⓞ</f>the scribes of <f>[1]</f> the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, <f>ⓟ</f>“Why does he eat <f>[2]</f> with tax collectors and sinners?”
Mark 2-17 And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, <J>“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. <f>ⓠ</f>I came not to call the righteous, <f>ⓡ</f>but sinners.”</J>
Mark 2-18 <pb/>Now <f>ⓢ</f>John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, <f>ⓣ</f>“Why do John's disciples and <f>ⓤ</f>the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
Mark 2-19 And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</J>
Mark 2-20 <J><f>ⓦ</f> The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and <f>ⓧ</f>then they will fast in that day.</J>
Mark 2-21 <J>No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.</J>
Mark 2-22 <J>And no one puts new wine into old <f>ⓨ</f>wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins — and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins.” <f>[3]</f></J>
Mark 2-23 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples <f>ⓐ</f>began to pluck heads of grain.
Mark 2-24 And the Pharisees were saying to him, “Look, <f>ⓑ</f>why are they doing <f>ⓒ</f>what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
Mark 2-25 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Have you never read <f>ⓔ</f>what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:</J>
Mark 2-26 <J>how he entered the house of God, in the time of <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>Abiathar the high priest, and ate <f>ⓖ</f>the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?”</J>
Mark 2-27 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“The Sabbath was made for man, <f>ⓘ</f>not man for the Sabbath.</J>
Mark 2-28 <J>So <f>ⓙ</f>the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</J>
