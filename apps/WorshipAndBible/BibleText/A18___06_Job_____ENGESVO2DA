Job 6-1 <pb/>Then Job answered and said:
Job 6-2 <pb/><t>“Oh that my vexation were weighed, </t><t>and all my calamity laid in the balances!</t>
Job 6-3 <t>For then it would be heavier than <f>ⓐ</f>the sand of the sea; </t><t>therefore my words have been rash.</t>
Job 6-4 <t>For <f>ⓑ</f>the arrows of the Almighty are in me; </t><t>my spirit drinks their poison; </t><t>the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</t>
Job 6-5 <t>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, </t><t>or the ox low over his fodder?</t>
Job 6-6 <t>Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, </t><t>or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow? <f>[1]</f></t>
Job 6-7 <t>My appetite refuses to touch them; </t><t>they are as food that is loathsome to me. <f>[2]</f> </t>
Job 6-8 <pb/><t>“Oh that I might have my request, </t><t>and that God would fulfill my hope,</t>
Job 6-9 <t>that it would <f>ⓒ</f>please God to crush me, </t><t>that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</t>
Job 6-10 <t>This would be my comfort; </t><t>I would even exult <f>[3]</f> in pain <f>ⓓ</f>unsparing, </t><t>for I have not denied the words of <f>ⓔ</f>the Holy One.</t>
Job 6-11 <t>What is my strength, that I should wait? </t><t>And what is my end, that I should be patient?</t>
Job 6-12 <t>Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?</t>
Job 6-13 <t>Have I any help in me, </t><t>when resource is driven from me? </t>
Job 6-14 <pb/><t>“He who <f>ⓕ</f>withholds <f>[4]</f> kindness from a <f>ⓖ</f>friend </t><t>forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</t>
Job 6-15 <t>My <f>ⓗ</f>brothers are <f>ⓘ</f>treacherous as a torrent-bed, </t><t>as torrential <f>ⓙ</f>streams that pass away,</t>
Job 6-16 <t>which are dark with ice, </t><t>and where the snow hides itself.</t>
Job 6-17 <t>When they melt, they disappear; </t><t>when it is hot, they vanish from their place.</t>
Job 6-18 <t>The caravans turn aside from their course; </t><t>they go up into <f>ⓚ</f>the waste and perish.</t>
Job 6-19 <t>The caravans of <f>ⓛ</f>Tema look, </t><t>the travelers of <f>ⓜ</f>Sheba hope.</t>
Job 6-20 <t>They are <f>ⓝ</f>ashamed because they were confident; </t><t>they come there and are <f>ⓞ</f>disappointed.</t>
Job 6-21 <t>For you have now become nothing; </t><t>you see my calamity and are afraid.</t>
Job 6-22 <t>Have I said, ‘Make me a gift’? </t><t>Or, ‘From your wealth offer a bribe for me’?</t>
Job 6-23 <t>Or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary's hand’? </t><t>Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of <f>ⓟ</f>the ruthless’? </t>
Job 6-24 <pb/><t>“Teach me, and I will be silent; </t><t>make me understand how I have gone astray.</t>
Job 6-25 <t>How forceful are upright words! </t><t>But what does reproof from you reprove?</t>
Job 6-26 <t>Do you think that you can reprove words, </t><t>when the speech of a despairing man is <f>ⓠ</f>wind?</t>
Job 6-27 <t>You would even <f>ⓡ</f>cast lots over the fatherless, </t><t>and bargain over your friend. </t>
Job 6-28 <pb/><t>“But now, be pleased to look at me, </t><t>for I will not lie to your face.</t>
Job 6-29 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Please turn; let no injustice be done. </t><t>Turn now; my vindication is at stake.</t>
Job 6-30 <t>Is there any injustice on my tongue? </t><t>Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity? </t>
