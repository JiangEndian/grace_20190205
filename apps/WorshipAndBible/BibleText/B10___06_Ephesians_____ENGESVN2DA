Ephesians 6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Ephesians 6-2 <f>ⓑ</f> “Honor your father and mother” (this is the first commandment with a promise),
Ephesians 6-3 “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.”
Ephesians 6-4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, <f>ⓒ</f>but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
Ephesians 6-5 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Bondservants, <f>[1]</f> obey your earthly masters <f>[2]</f> with fear and trembling, <f>ⓔ</f>with a sincere heart, <f>ⓕ</f>as you would Christ,
Ephesians 6-6 not by the way of eye-service, as <f>ⓖ</f>people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,
Ephesians 6-7 rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man,
Ephesians 6-8 <f>ⓗ</f> knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, <f>ⓘ</f>whether he is a bondservant or is free.
Ephesians 6-9 Masters, do the same to them, <f>ⓙ</f>and stop your threatening, knowing that <f>ⓚ</f>he who is both their Master <f>[3]</f> and yours is in heaven, and that <f>ⓛ</f>there is no partiality with him.

Ephesians 6-12 For <f>ⓡ</f>we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against <f>ⓢ</f>the rulers, against the authorities, against <f>ⓣ</f>the cosmic powers over <f>ⓤ</f>this present darkness, against <f>ⓥ</f>the spiritual forces of evil <f>ⓦ</f>in the heavenly places.
Ephesians 6-13 Therefore <f>ⓧ</f>take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in <f>ⓨ</f>the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.
Ephesians 6-14 Stand therefore, <f>ⓩ</f>having fastened on the belt of truth, and <f>ⓐ</f>having put on the breastplate of righteousness,

Ephesians 6-16 In all circumstances take up <f>ⓒ</f>the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all <f>ⓓ</f>the flaming darts of <f>ⓔ</f>the evil one;
Ephesians 6-17 and take <f>ⓕ</f>the helmet of salvation, and <f>ⓖ</f>the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
Ephesians 6-18 praying <f>ⓗ</f>at all times <f>ⓘ</f>in the Spirit, <f>ⓙ</f>with all prayer and supplication. To that end, <f>ⓚ</f>keep alert with all perseverance, making <f>ⓛ</f>supplication for all the saints,
Ephesians 6-19 and <f>ⓜ</f>also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth <f>ⓝ</f>boldly to proclaim <f>ⓞ</f>the mystery of the gospel,
Ephesians 6-20 for which I <f>ⓟ</f>am an ambassador <f>ⓠ</f>in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.
Ephesians 6-21 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing, <f>ⓢ</f>Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will tell you everything.
