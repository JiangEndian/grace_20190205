Ezekiel 12-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, you dwell in the midst of <f>ⓑ</f>a rebellious house, <f>ⓒ</f>who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not, for they are <f>ⓓ</f>a rebellious house.
Ezekiel 12-3 As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself <f>ⓔ</f>an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day <f>ⓕ</f>in their sight. You shall go like an exile from your place to another place <f>ⓖ</f>in their sight. <f>ⓗ</f>Perhaps they will understand, though <f>[1]</f> they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel 12-4 You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile, and you shall go out yourself <f>ⓘ</f>at evening in their sight, as those do who must go into exile.
Ezekiel 12-5 In their sight <f>ⓙ</f>dig through the wall, and bring your baggage out through it.
Ezekiel 12-6 In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder and carry it out at dusk. You shall cover your face that you may not see the land, for I have made you <f>ⓚ</f>a sign for the house of Israel.”
Ezekiel 12-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And I did as I was commanded. <f>ⓜ</f>I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands. I brought out my baggage at dusk, carrying it on my shoulder in their sight.
Ezekiel 12-8 <pb/>In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-9 <f>ⓝ</f> “Son of man, has not the house of Israel, <f>ⓞ</f>the rebellious house, said to you, <f>ⓟ</f>‘What are you doing?’
Ezekiel 12-10 Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓠ</f>the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.’ <f>[3]</f>
Ezekiel 12-11 Say, <f>ⓡ</f>‘I am a sign for you: <f>ⓢ</f>as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall go into exile, into captivity.’
Ezekiel 12-12 <f>ⓣ</f> And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder at dusk, and shall go out. <f>ⓤ</f>They shall dig through the wall to bring him out through it. <f>ⓥ</f>He shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes.
Ezekiel 12-13 <f>ⓦ</f> And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. And <f>ⓧ</f>I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, <f>ⓨ</f>yet he shall not see it, and he shall die there.
Ezekiel 12-14 <f>ⓩ</f> And I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops, <f>ⓐ</f>and I will unsheathe the sword after them.
Ezekiel 12-15 <f>ⓑ</f> And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
Ezekiel 12-16 <f>ⓒ</f> But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, <f>ⓓ</f>and may know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel 12-17 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-18 <f>ⓔ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓕ</f>eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with anxiety.
Ezekiel 12-19 And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: <f>ⓖ</f>They shall eat their bread with anxiety, <f>ⓗ</f>and drink water in dismay. In this way <f>ⓘ</f>her land will be stripped of all it contains, <f>ⓙ</f>on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
Ezekiel 12-20 <f>ⓚ</f> And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel 12-21 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-22 “Son of man, <f>ⓛ</f>what is this proverb that you <f>[4]</f> have about the land of Israel, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>‘The days grow long, and every vision comes to nothing’?
Ezekiel 12-23 Tell them therefore, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.’ But say to them, <f>ⓝ</f>The days are near, and the fulfillment <f>[5]</f> of every vision.
Ezekiel 12-24 <f>ⓞ</f> For there shall be no more any <f>ⓟ</f>false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel 12-25 For I am the LORD; I will speak <f>ⓠ</f>the word that I will speak, and it will be performed. <f>ⓡ</f>It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, <f>ⓢ</f>O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it, declares the Lord GOD.”
Ezekiel 12-26 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 12-27 “Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, <f>ⓣ</f>‘The vision that he sees is <f>ⓤ</f>for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.’
Ezekiel 12-28 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓥ</f>None of my words will be delayed any longer, <f>ⓦ</f>but the word that I speak will be performed, declares the Lord GOD.”
