2 Peter 3-1 <pb/>This is now the second letter that I am writing to you, beloved. In both of them <f>ⓐ</f>I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,
2 Peter 3-2 <f>ⓑ</f> that you should remember the predictions of <f>ⓒ</f>the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles,
2 Peter 3-3 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come <f>ⓓ</f>in the last days with scoffing, <f>ⓔ</f>following their own sinful desires.
2 Peter 3-4 <f>ⓕ</f> They will say, “Where is the promise of <f>ⓖ</f>his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.”
2 Peter 3-5 For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth <f>ⓗ</f>was formed out of water and through water <f>ⓘ</f>by the word of God,
2 Peter 3-6 and that by means of these the world that then existed <f>ⓙ</f>was deluged with water and <f>ⓚ</f>perished.
2 Peter 3-7 But by the same word <f>ⓛ</f>the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and <f>ⓜ</f>destruction of the ungodly.
2 Peter 3-8 <pb/>But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and <f>ⓝ</f>a thousand years as one day.
2 Peter 3-9 <f>ⓞ</f> The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise <f>ⓟ</f>as some count slowness, but <f>ⓠ</f>is patient toward you, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>not wishing that any should perish, but <f>ⓢ</f>that all should reach repentance.
2 Peter 3-10 But <f>ⓣ</f>the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then <f>ⓤ</f>the heavens will pass away with a roar, and <f>ⓥ</f>the heavenly bodies <f>[2]</f> will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. <f>[3]</f>
2 Peter 3-11 <pb/>Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, <f>ⓦ</f>what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness,
2 Peter 3-12 <f>ⓧ</f> waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and <f>ⓨ</f>the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn!
2 Peter 3-13 But according to his promise we are waiting for <f>ⓩ</f>new heavens and a new earth <f>ⓐ</f>in which righteousness dwells.
2 Peter 3-14 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him <f>ⓒ</f>without spot or <f>ⓓ</f>blemish, and <f>ⓔ</f>at peace.
2 Peter 3-15 And count <f>ⓕ</f>the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as <f>ⓖ</f>our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you <f>ⓗ</f>according to the wisdom given him,
2 Peter 3-16 as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. <f>ⓘ</f>There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, <f>ⓙ</f>as they do the other Scriptures.
2 Peter 3-17 You therefore, beloved, <f>ⓚ</f>knowing this beforehand, <f>ⓛ</f>take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.
2 Peter 3-18 But <f>ⓜ</f>grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. <f>ⓝ</f>To him be the glory both now and to the day of <f>ⓞ</f>eternity. Amen.
