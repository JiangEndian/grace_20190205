Jeremiah 9-1 <pb/><t><pb/><f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>Oh that my head were waters, </t><t>and my eyes a fountain of tears, </t><t>that I might weep day and night </t><t>for the slain of <f>ⓑ</f>the daughter of my people!</t>
Jeremiah 9-2 <t><f>[2]</f> Oh that I had in the desert </t><t>a travelers' lodging place, </t><t>that I might leave my people </t><t>and go away from them! </t><t>For they are all <f>ⓒ</f>adulterers, </t><t>a company of <f>ⓓ</f>treacherous men.</t>
Jeremiah 9-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> They bend their tongue like a bow; </t><t>falsehood and not truth has grown strong <f>[3]</f> in the land; </t><t>for they proceed from evil to evil, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>and they do not know me, declares the LORD. </t>
Jeremiah 9-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> Let everyone beware of his neighbor, </t><t>and put no trust in any brother, </t><t>for every <f>ⓗ</f>brother is a deceiver, </t><t>and every neighbor <f>ⓘ</f>goes about as a slanderer.</t>
Jeremiah 9-5 <t>Everyone deceives his neighbor, </t><t>and no one speaks the truth; </t><t>they have taught their tongue to speak lies; </t><t>they weary themselves committing iniquity.</t>
Jeremiah 9-6 <t>Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>they refuse to know me, declares the LORD. </t>
Jeremiah 9-7 <pb/><t>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: </t><t>“Behold, <f>ⓚ</f>I will refine them and <f>ⓛ</f>test them, </t><t>for what else can I do, <f>ⓜ</f>because of my people?</t>
Jeremiah 9-8 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Their tongue is a deadly arrow; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>it speaks deceitfully; </t><t>with his mouth <f>ⓟ</f>each speaks peace to his neighbor, </t><t>but in his heart <f>ⓠ</f>he plans an ambush for him.</t>
Jeremiah 9-9 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD, </t><t>and shall I not avenge myself </t><t>on a nation such as this? </t>
Jeremiah 9-10 <pb/><t>“I will take up weeping and wailing for the mountains, </t><t>and a lamentation for <f>ⓢ</f>the pastures of the wilderness, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, </t><t>and the lowing of cattle is not heard; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>both the birds of the air and the beasts </t><t>have fled and are gone.</t>
Jeremiah 9-11 <t><f>ⓥ</f> I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>a lair of jackals, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, </t><t>without inhabitant.” </t>
Jeremiah 9-12 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Who is the man so wise that he can understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined <f>ⓩ</f>and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?
Jeremiah 9-13 And the LORD says: <f>ⓐ</f>“Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it,
Jeremiah 9-14 but <f>ⓑ</f>have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.
Jeremiah 9-15 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓒ</f>Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them <f>ⓓ</f>poisonous water to drink.
Jeremiah 9-16 <f>ⓔ</f> I will scatter them among the nations <f>ⓕ</f>whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will <f>ⓖ</f>send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”
Jeremiah 9-17 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD of hosts: </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>“Consider, and call for the mourning women to come; </t><t>send for the skillful women to come;</t>
Jeremiah 9-18 <t>let them make haste <f>ⓘ</f>and raise a wailing over us, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>that our eyes may run down with tears </t><t>and our eyelids flow with water.</t>
Jeremiah 9-19 <t>For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion: </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>‘How we are ruined! </t><t>We are utterly shamed, </t><t>because we have left the land, </t><t>because they have cast down our dwellings.’” </t>
Jeremiah 9-20 <pb/><t>Hear, O women, the word of the LORD, </t><t>and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; </t><t>teach to your daughters a lament, </t><t>and each to her neighbor a dirge.</t>
Jeremiah 9-21 <t>For death has come up into our windows; </t><t>it has entered our palaces, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>cutting off the children from the streets </t><t>and the young men from the squares.</t>
Jeremiah 9-22 <t>Speak: “Thus declares the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>‘The dead bodies of men shall fall </t><t>like dung upon the open field, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>like sheaves after the reaper, </t><t>and none shall gather them.’” </t>
Jeremiah 9-23 <pb/>Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓞ</f>“Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches,
Jeremiah 9-24 but <f>ⓟ</f>let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. <f>ⓠ</f>For in these things I delight, declares the LORD.”
Jeremiah 9-25 <pb/>“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when <f>ⓡ</f>I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh —
Jeremiah 9-26 <f>ⓢ</f> Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and <f>ⓣ</f>all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are <f>ⓤ</f>uncircumcised in heart.”
