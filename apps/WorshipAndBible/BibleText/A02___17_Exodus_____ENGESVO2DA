Exodus 17-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
Exodus 17-2 <f>ⓑ</f> Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you <f>ⓒ</f>test the LORD?”
Exodus 17-3 But the people thirsted there for water, and <f>ⓓ</f>the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?”
Exodus 17-4 So Moses cried to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready <f>ⓔ</f>to stone me.”
Exodus 17-5 And the LORD said to Moses, “Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with <f>ⓕ</f>which you struck the Nile, and go.
Exodus 17-6 <f>ⓖ</f> Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel.
Exodus 17-7 And he called the name of the place <f>ⓗ</f>Massah <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓘ</f>Meribah, <f>[2]</f> because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”
Exodus 17-8 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
Exodus 17-9 So Moses said to <f>ⓚ</f>Joshua, “Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with <f>ⓛ</f>the staff of God in my hand.”
Exodus 17-10 So <f>ⓜ</f>Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and <f>ⓝ</f>Hur went up to the top of the hill.
Exodus 17-11 Whenever Moses <f>ⓞ</f>held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed.
Exodus 17-12 But Moses' hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and <f>ⓟ</f>Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
Exodus 17-13 And <f>ⓠ</f>Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword.
Exodus 17-14 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of <f>ⓡ</f>Joshua, that <f>ⓢ</f>I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”
Exodus 17-15 And Moses <f>ⓣ</f>built an altar and called the name of it, The LORD Is My Banner,
Exodus 17-16 saying, “A hand upon the throne <f>[3]</f> of the LORD! <f>ⓤ</f>The LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.”
