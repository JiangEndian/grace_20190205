Numbers 25-1 <pb/>While Israel lived in <f>ⓐ</f>Shittim, <f>ⓑ</f>the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab.
Numbers 25-2 <f>ⓒ</f> These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
Numbers 25-3 So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
Numbers 25-4 And the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓓ</f>“Take all the chiefs of the people and <f>ⓔ</f>hang <f>[1]</f> them in the sun before the LORD, <f>ⓕ</f>that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.”
Numbers 25-5 And Moses said to <f>ⓖ</f>the judges of Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>“Each of you kill those of his men who have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor.”
Numbers 25-6 <pb/>And behold, one of the people of Israel came and brought a Midianite woman to his family, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole congregation of the people of Israel, while they were <f>ⓘ</f>weeping in the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Numbers 25-7 <f>ⓙ</f> When Phinehas <f>ⓚ</f>the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose and left the congregation and took a spear in his hand
Numbers 25-8 and went after the man of Israel into the chamber and pierced both of them, the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. Thus the plague on the people of Israel was stopped.
Numbers 25-9 Nevertheless, <f>ⓛ</f>those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
Numbers 25-10 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses,
Numbers 25-11 “Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the people of Israel, in that he <f>ⓜ</f>was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the people of Israel in <f>ⓝ</f>my jealousy.
Numbers 25-12 Therefore say, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace,
Numbers 25-13 and it shall be to him and to <f>ⓟ</f>his descendants after him the covenant of <f>ⓠ</f>a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the people of Israel.’”
Numbers 25-14 <pb/>The name of the slain man of Israel, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, chief of a father's house belonging to the Simeonites.
Numbers 25-15 And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of <f>ⓡ</f>Zur, who was the tribal head of a father's house in Midian.
Numbers 25-16 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 25-17 <f>ⓢ</f> “Harass the Midianites and strike them down,
Numbers 25-18 for they have harassed you with their <f>ⓣ</f>wiles, with which they beguiled you in the matter of <f>ⓤ</f>Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the chief of Midian, their sister, who was killed on the day of the plague on account of Peor.”
