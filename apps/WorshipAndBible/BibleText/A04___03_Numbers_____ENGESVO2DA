Numbers 3-4 <f>ⓓ</f> But Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of Aaron their father.
Numbers 3-5 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 3-6 <f>ⓔ</f> “Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him.
Numbers 3-7 They shall keep guard over him and over the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, <f>ⓕ</f>as they minister at the tabernacle.
Numbers 3-8 They shall guard all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, and keep guard over the people of Israel as they minister at the tabernacle.
Numbers 3-9 And <f>ⓖ</f>you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are <f>ⓗ</f>wholly given to him from among the people of Israel.
Numbers 3-10 And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and <f>ⓘ</f>they shall guard their priesthood. But if <f>ⓙ</f>any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death.”
Numbers 3-11 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 3-12 “Behold, <f>ⓚ</f>I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the people of Israel. The Levites shall be mine,
Numbers 3-13 for <f>ⓛ</f>all the firstborn are mine. <f>ⓜ</f>On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for my own all the firstborn in Israel, both of man and of beast. They shall be mine: I am the LORD.”
Numbers 3-14 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
Numbers 3-15 “List the sons of Levi, by fathers' houses and by clans; <f>ⓝ</f>every male from a month old and upward you shall list.”

Numbers 3-26 <f>ⓨ</f> the hangings of the court, <f>ⓩ</f>the screen for the door of the court that is around the tabernacle and the altar, and <f>ⓐ</f>its cords — all the service connected with these.

Numbers 3-37 also <f>ⓜ</f>the pillars around the court, with their bases and <f>ⓝ</f>pegs and <f>ⓞ</f>cords.
Numbers 3-38 <pb/>Those who were to camp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, <f>ⓟ</f>guarding the sanctuary itself, to protect <f>[2]</f> the people of Israel. And any outsider who came near was to be put to death.

Numbers 3-41 <f>ⓡ</f> And you shall take the Levites for me — I am the LORD — instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the people of Israel.”

Numbers 3-43 And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names, from a month old and upward as listed were 22,273.
Numbers 3-44 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
