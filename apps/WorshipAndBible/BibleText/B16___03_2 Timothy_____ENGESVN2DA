2 Timothy 3-1 <pb/>But understand this, that <f>ⓐ</f>in the last days there will come times of difficulty.
2 Timothy 3-2 For people will be <f>ⓑ</f>lovers of self, <f>ⓒ</f>lovers of money, <f>ⓓ</f>proud, <f>ⓔ</f>arrogant, abusive, <f>ⓕ</f>disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
2 Timothy 3-3 <f>ⓖ</f> heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, <f>ⓗ</f>not loving good,
2 Timothy 3-4 treacherous, reckless, <f>ⓘ</f>swollen with conceit, <f>ⓙ</f>lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
2 Timothy 3-5 having the appearance of godliness, but <f>ⓚ</f>denying its power. <f>ⓛ</f>Avoid such people.
2 Timothy 3-6 For among them are <f>ⓜ</f>those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions,
2 Timothy 3-7 always learning and never able to <f>ⓝ</f>arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy 3-8 Just as <f>ⓞ</f>Jannes and Jambres <f>ⓟ</f>opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, <f>ⓠ</f>men corrupted in mind and <f>ⓡ</f>disqualified regarding the faith.
2 Timothy 3-9 But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, <f>ⓢ</f>as was that of those two men.
2 Timothy 3-10 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,
2 Timothy 3-11 my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me <f>ⓤ</f>at Antioch, <f>ⓥ</f>at Iconium, and <f>ⓦ</f>at Lystra — which persecutions I endured; yet <f>ⓧ</f>from them all <f>ⓨ</f>the Lord rescued me.
2 Timothy 3-12 Indeed, all who desire to <f>ⓩ</f>live a godly life in Christ Jesus <f>ⓐ</f>will be persecuted,
2 Timothy 3-13 while <f>ⓑ</f>evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and <f>ⓒ</f>being deceived.
2 Timothy 3-14 But as for you, <f>ⓓ</f>continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom <f>[1]</f> you learned it
2 Timothy 3-15 and how <f>ⓔ</f>from childhood you have been acquainted with <f>ⓕ</f>the sacred writings, <f>ⓖ</f>which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy 3-16 <f>ⓗ</f> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
2 Timothy 3-17 that <f>ⓘ</f>the man of God <f>[2]</f> may be complete, <f>ⓙ</f>equipped <f>ⓚ</f>for every good work.
