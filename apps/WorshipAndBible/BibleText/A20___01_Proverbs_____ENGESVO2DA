Proverbs 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs 1-2 <pb/><t>To know wisdom and instruction, </t><t>to understand words of insight,</t>
Proverbs 1-3 <t>to receive instruction in wise dealing, </t><t>in <f>ⓑ</f>righteousness, justice, and equity;</t>
Proverbs 1-4 <t>to give prudence to <f>ⓒ</f>the simple, </t><t>knowledge and <f>ⓓ</f>discretion to the youth — </t>
Proverbs 1-5 <t>Let the wise hear and <f>ⓔ</f>increase in learning, </t><t>and the one who understands obtain guidance,</t>
Proverbs 1-6 <t>to understand a proverb and a saying, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the words of the wise and their <f>ⓖ</f>riddles. </t>
Proverbs 1-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; </t><t>fools despise wisdom and instruction. </t>
Proverbs 1-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Hear, my son, your father's instruction, </t><t>and forsake not your mother's teaching,</t>
Proverbs 1-9 <t>for they are <f>ⓙ</f>a graceful garland for your head </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>pendants for your neck.</t>
Proverbs 1-10 <t>My son, if sinners <f>ⓛ</f>entice you, </t><t>do not consent.</t>
Proverbs 1-11 <t>If they say, “Come with us, <f>ⓜ</f>let us lie in wait for blood; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>let us ambush the innocent without reason;</t>
Proverbs 1-12 <t>like Sheol let us <f>ⓞ</f>swallow them alive, </t><t>and whole, like <f>ⓟ</f>those who go down to the pit;</t>
Proverbs 1-13 <t>we shall find all precious goods, </t><t>we shall fill our houses with plunder;</t>
Proverbs 1-14 <t>throw in your lot among us; </t><t>we will all have one purse” — </t>
Proverbs 1-15 <t>my son, <f>ⓠ</f>do not walk in the way with them; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>hold back your foot from their paths,</t>
Proverbs 1-16 <t>for <f>ⓢ</f>their feet run to evil, </t><t>and they make haste to shed blood.</t>
Proverbs 1-17 <t><f>ⓣ</f> For in vain is a net spread </t><t>in the sight of any bird,</t>
Proverbs 1-18 <t>but these men <f>ⓤ</f>lie in wait for their own blood; </t><t>they <f>ⓥ</f>set an ambush for their own lives.</t>
Proverbs 1-19 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Such are the ways of everyone who is <f>ⓧ</f>greedy for unjust gain; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>it takes away the life of its possessors. </t>
Proverbs 1-20 <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f> Wisdom cries aloud in the street, </t><t>in the markets she raises her voice;</t>
Proverbs 1-21 <t>at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; </t><t>at <f>ⓐ</f>the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</t>
Proverbs 1-22 <t>“How long, O <f>ⓑ</f>simple ones, will you love being simple? </t><t>How long will <f>ⓒ</f>scoffers delight in their scoffing </t><t>and fools <f>ⓓ</f>hate knowledge?</t>
Proverbs 1-23 <t>If you turn at my reproof, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>behold, I will <f>ⓔ</f>pour out my spirit to you; </t><t>I will make my words known to you.</t>
Proverbs 1-24 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Because I have called and <f>ⓖ</f>you refused to listen, </t><t>have <f>ⓗ</f>stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</t>
Proverbs 1-25 <t>because you have <f>ⓘ</f>ignored all my counsel </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>would have none of my reproof,</t>
Proverbs 1-26 <t>I also <f>ⓚ</f>will laugh at your calamity; </t><t>I will mock when <f>ⓛ</f>terror strikes you,</t>
Proverbs 1-27 <t>when terror strikes you like <f>ⓜ</f>a storm </t><t>and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, </t><t>when distress and anguish come upon you.</t>
Proverbs 1-28 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; </t><t>they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</t>
Proverbs 1-29 <t>Because they <f>ⓞ</f>hated knowledge </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>did not choose the fear of the LORD,</t>
Proverbs 1-30 <t><f>ⓠ</f> would have none of my counsel </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>despised all my reproof,</t>
Proverbs 1-31 <t>therefore they shall eat <f>ⓢ</f>the fruit of their way, </t><t>and have <f>ⓣ</f>their fill of their own devices.</t>
Proverbs 1-32 <t>For the simple are killed by <f>ⓤ</f>their turning away, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>the complacency of fools destroys them;</t>
Proverbs 1-33 <t>but <f>ⓦ</f>whoever listens to me will dwell secure </t><t>and will be <f>ⓧ</f>at ease, without dread of disaster.” </t>
