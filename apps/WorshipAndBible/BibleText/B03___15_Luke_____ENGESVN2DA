Luke 15-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him.
Luke 15-2 And the Pharisees and the scribes <f>ⓑ</f>grumbled, saying, <f>ⓒ</f>“This man receives sinners and <f>ⓓ</f>eats with them.”
Luke 15-3 <pb/>So he told them this parable:
Luke 15-4 <J><f>ⓔ</f> “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, <f>ⓕ</f>if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine <f>ⓖ</f>in the open country, and <f>ⓗ</f>go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?</J>
Luke 15-5 <J>And when he has found it, <f>ⓘ</f>he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</J>
Luke 15-6 <J>And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for <f>ⓙ</f>I have found my sheep that was lost.’</J>
Luke 15-7 <J>Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who <f>ⓚ</f>repents than over ninety-nine <f>ⓛ</f>righteous persons who need no repentance.</J>
Luke 15-8 <pb/><J>“Or what woman, having ten silver coins, <f>[1]</f> if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?</J>
Luke 15-9 <J>And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’</J>
Luke 15-10 <J>Just so, I tell you, there is joy before <f>ⓜ</f>the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</J>
Luke 15-11 <pb/>And he said, <J>“There was a man who had two sons.</J>
Luke 15-12 <J>And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me <f>ⓝ</f>the share of property that is coming to me.’ And he divided <f>ⓞ</f>his property between them.</J>
Luke 15-13 <J>Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in <f>ⓟ</f>reckless living.</J>
Luke 15-14 <J>And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.</J>
Luke 15-15 <J>So he went and hired himself out to <f>[2]</f> one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.</J>
Luke 15-16 <J>And he <f>ⓠ</f>was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.</J>
Luke 15-17 <pb/><J>“But <f>ⓡ</f>when he <f>ⓢ</f>came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!</J>
Luke 15-18 <J>I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, <f>ⓣ</f>I have sinned against <f>ⓤ</f>heaven and before you.</J>
Luke 15-19 <J><f>ⓥ</f> I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.”’</J>
Luke 15-20 <J>And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and <f>ⓦ</f>ran and <f>ⓧ</f>embraced him and <f>ⓨ</f>kissed him.</J>
Luke 15-21 <J>And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. <f>ⓩ</f>I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ <f>[3]</f></J>
Luke 15-22 <J>But the father said to his servants, <f>[4]</f> ‘Bring quickly <f>ⓐ</f>the best robe, and put it on him, and put <f>ⓑ</f>a ring on his hand, and <f>ⓒ</f>shoes on his feet.</J>
Luke 15-23 <J>And bring <f>ⓓ</f>the fattened calf and kill it, and <f>ⓔ</f>let us eat and celebrate.</J>
Luke 15-24 <J>For this my son <f>ⓕ</f>was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.</J>
Luke 15-25 <pb/><J>“Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</J>
Luke 15-26 <J>And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</J>
Luke 15-27 <J>And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’</J>
Luke 15-28 <J>But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,</J>
Luke 15-29 <J>but he answered his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might <f>ⓖ</f>celebrate with my friends.</J>
Luke 15-30 <J>But when this son of yours came, <f>ⓗ</f>who has devoured <f>ⓘ</f>your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’</J>
Luke 15-31 <J>And he said to him, ‘Son, <f>ⓙ</f>you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.</J>
Luke 15-32 <J>It was fitting <f>ⓚ</f>to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother <f>ⓛ</f>was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.’”</J>
