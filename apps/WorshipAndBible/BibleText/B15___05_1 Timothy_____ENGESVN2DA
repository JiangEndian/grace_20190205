1 Timothy 5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father, <f>ⓑ</f>younger men as brothers,
1 Timothy 5-2 older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.
1 Timothy 5-3 <pb/>Honor widows <f>ⓒ</f>who are truly widows.
1 Timothy 5-4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn <f>ⓓ</f>to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents, for <f>ⓔ</f>this is pleasing in the sight of God.
1 Timothy 5-5 She <f>ⓕ</f>who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on God and <f>ⓖ</f>continues in supplications and prayers night and day,
1 Timothy 5-6 but <f>ⓗ</f>she who is self-indulgent is <f>ⓘ</f>dead even while she lives.
1 Timothy 5-7 <f>ⓙ</f> Command these things as well, so that they may be without reproach.
1 Timothy 5-8 But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for <f>ⓚ</f>members of his household, he has <f>ⓛ</f>denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
1 Timothy 5-9 <pb/>Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age, having been <f>ⓜ</f>the wife of one husband, <f>[1]</f>
1 Timothy 5-10 and having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, has <f>ⓝ</f>shown hospitality, <f>ⓞ</f>has washed the feet of the saints, has <f>ⓟ</f>cared for the afflicted, and has <f>ⓠ</f>devoted herself to every good work.
1 Timothy 5-11 But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when <f>ⓡ</f>their passions draw them away from Christ, they desire to marry
1 Timothy 5-12 and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith.
1 Timothy 5-13 Besides that, they learn to be idlers, going about from house to house, and not only idlers, but also <f>ⓢ</f>gossips and <f>ⓣ</f>busybodies, saying what they should not.
1 Timothy 5-14 So I would have <f>ⓤ</f>younger widows marry, bear children, <f>ⓥ</f>manage their households, and <f>ⓦ</f>give the adversary no occasion for slander.
1 Timothy 5-15 <f>ⓧ</f> For some have already strayed after Satan.
1 Timothy 5-16 If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her care for them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those <f>ⓨ</f>who are truly widows.
1 Timothy 5-17 <pb/>Let the elders <f>ⓩ</f>who rule well be considered worthy of <f>ⓐ</f>double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.
1 Timothy 5-18 For the Scripture says, <f>ⓑ</f>“You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“The laborer deserves his wages.”</J>
1 Timothy 5-19 Do not admit a charge against an elder except <f>ⓓ</f>on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy 5-20 As for those who persist in sin, <f>ⓔ</f>rebuke them in the presence of all, <f>ⓕ</f>so that the rest may stand in fear.
1 Timothy 5-21 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels <f>ⓖ</f>I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, <f>ⓗ</f>doing nothing from partiality.
1 Timothy 5-22 <f>ⓘ</f> Do not be hasty in the <f>ⓙ</f>laying on of hands, nor <f>ⓚ</f>take part in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
1 Timothy 5-23 (No longer drink only water, but <f>ⓛ</f>use a little wine <f>ⓜ</f>for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.)
1 Timothy 5-24 The sins of some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear later.
1 Timothy 5-25 So also good works are conspicuous, and <f>ⓝ</f>even those that are not cannot remain hidden.
