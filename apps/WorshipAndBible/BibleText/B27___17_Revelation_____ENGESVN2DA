Revelation 17-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>one of the seven angels who had <f>ⓑ</f>the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of <f>ⓒ</f>the great prostitute <f>ⓓ</f>who is seated on many waters,
Revelation 17-2 <f>ⓔ</f> with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and <f>ⓕ</f>with the wine of whose sexual immorality <f>ⓖ</f>the dwellers on earth have become drunk.”
Revelation 17-3 And <f>ⓗ</f>he carried me away in the Spirit <f>ⓘ</f>into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on <f>ⓙ</f>a scarlet beast that was full of <f>ⓚ</f>blasphemous names, and <f>ⓛ</f>it had seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation 17-4 The woman <f>ⓜ</f>was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned <f>ⓝ</f>with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand <f>ⓞ</f>a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.
Revelation 17-5 And on her forehead was written a name of <f>ⓟ</f>mystery: <f>ⓠ</f>“Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth's abominations.”
Revelation 17-6 And I saw the woman, drunk <f>ⓡ</f>with the blood of the saints, the blood of <f>ⓢ</f>the martyrs of Jesus. <f>[1]</f> <pb/>When I saw her, I marveled greatly.
Revelation 17-7 But the angel said to me, “Why do you marvel? I will tell you <f>ⓣ</f>the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.
Revelation 17-8 The beast that you saw <f>ⓤ</f>was, and is not, and <f>ⓥ</f>is about to rise from <f>ⓦ</f>the bottomless pit <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓧ</f>go to destruction. And <f>ⓨ</f>the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in <f>ⓩ</f>the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because <f>ⓐ</f>it was and is not and is to come.
Revelation 17-9 <f>ⓑ</f> This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated;
Revelation 17-10 they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while.
Revelation 17-11 As for the beast <f>ⓒ</f>that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.
Revelation 17-12 And <f>ⓓ</f>the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings <f>ⓔ</f>for one hour, together with the beast.
Revelation 17-13 These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.
Revelation 17-14 They <f>ⓕ</f>will make war on the Lamb, and <f>ⓖ</f>the Lamb will conquer them, for he is <f>ⓗ</f>Lord of lords and <f>ⓘ</f>King of kings, and those with him are <f>ⓙ</f>called and chosen and faithful.”
Revelation 17-15 <pb/>And the angel <f>[3]</f> said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.
Revelation 17-16 And <f>ⓛ</f>the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast <f>ⓜ</f>will hate the prostitute. They will make her <f>ⓝ</f>desolate and <f>ⓞ</f>naked, and <f>ⓟ</f>devour her flesh and <f>ⓠ</f>burn her up with fire,
Revelation 17-17 for <f>ⓡ</f>God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and <f>ⓢ</f>handing over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
Revelation 17-18 And the woman that you saw is <f>ⓣ</f>the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.”
