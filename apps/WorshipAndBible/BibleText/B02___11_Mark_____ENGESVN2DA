Mark 11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to <f>ⓑ</f>Bethphage and Bethany, at <f>ⓒ</f>the Mount of Olives, Jesus <f>[1]</f> sent <f>ⓓ</f>two of his disciples
Mark 11-2 and said to them, <J>“Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, <f>ⓔ</f>on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it.</J>
Mark 11-3 <J>If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’”</J>
Mark 11-4 And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it.
Mark 11-5 And some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”
Mark 11-6 And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go.
Mark 11-7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.
Mark 11-8 And many <f>ⓕ</f>spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields.
Mark 11-9 And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, <f>ⓖ</f>“Hosanna! <f>ⓗ</f>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
Mark 11-10 Blessed is <f>ⓘ</f>the coming <f>ⓙ</f>kingdom of <f>ⓚ</f>our father <f>ⓛ</f>David! <f>ⓜ</f>Hosanna <f>ⓝ</f>in the highest!”
Mark 11-11 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, <f>ⓟ</f>he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
Mark 11-12 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> On the following day, when they came from Bethany, <f>ⓡ</f>he was hungry.
Mark 11-13 <f>ⓢ</f> And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for <f>ⓣ</f>it was not the season for figs.
Mark 11-14 And he said to it, <J>“May no one ever eat fruit from you again.”</J> And his disciples heard it.
Mark 11-15 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of <f>ⓥ</f>the money-changers and the seats of those who sold <f>ⓦ</f>pigeons.
Mark 11-16 And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple.
Mark 11-17 And he was teaching them and saying to them, <J>“Is it not written, <f>ⓧ</f>‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But <f>ⓨ</f>you have made it a den of robbers.”</J>
Mark 11-18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and <f>ⓩ</f>were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because <f>ⓐ</f>all the crowd was astonished at his teaching.
Mark 11-19 <f>ⓑ</f> And when evening came they <f>[2]</f> went out of the city.
Mark 11-20 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots.
Mark 11-21 And Peter remembered and said to him, <f>ⓓ</f>“Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.”
Mark 11-22 And Jesus answered them, <J>“Have <f>ⓔ</f>faith in God.</J>
Mark 11-23 <J><f>ⓕ</f> Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not <f>ⓗ</f>doubt in his heart, but <f>ⓘ</f>believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</J>
Mark 11-24 <J>Therefore I tell you, <f>ⓙ</f>whatever you ask in prayer, <f>ⓚ</f>believe that you <f>ⓛ</f>have received <f>[3]</f> it, and it will be yours.</J>
Mark 11-25 <J>And whenever <f>ⓜ</f>you stand praying, <f>ⓝ</f>forgive, <f>ⓞ</f>if you have anything against anyone, so that <f>ⓟ</f>your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.” <f>[4]</f></J>
Mark 11-26 
Mark 11-27 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him,
Mark 11-28 and they said to him, <f>ⓡ</f>“By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?”
Mark 11-29 Jesus said to them, <J>“I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</J>
Mark 11-30 <J>Was the baptism of John <f>ⓢ</f>from heaven or from man? Answer me.”</J>
Mark 11-31 And they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, <f>ⓣ</f>‘Why then did you not believe him?’
Mark 11-32 But shall we say, ‘From man’?” — <f>ⓤ</f>they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was <f>ⓥ</f>a prophet.
Mark 11-33 So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, <J>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</J>
