Titus 3-1 <pb/>Remind them <f>ⓐ</f>to be submissive to rulers and authorities, <f>ⓑ</f>to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
Titus 3-2 <f>ⓒ</f> to speak evil of no one, <f>ⓓ</f>to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and <f>ⓔ</f>to show perfect courtesy toward all people.
Titus 3-3 For <f>ⓕ</f>we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
Titus 3-4 But when <f>ⓖ</f>the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,
Titus 3-5 he saved us, <f>ⓗ</f>not because of works done by us in righteousness, but <f>ⓘ</f>according to his own mercy, by <f>ⓙ</f>the washing of regeneration and <f>ⓚ</f>renewal of the Holy Spirit,
Titus 3-6 whom he <f>ⓛ</f>poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
Titus 3-7 so that <f>ⓜ</f>being justified by his grace we might become <f>ⓝ</f>heirs <f>ⓞ</f>according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus 3-8 The saying is <f>ⓟ</f>trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful <f>ⓠ</f>to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people.
Titus 3-9 But <f>ⓡ</f>avoid foolish <f>ⓢ</f>controversies, <f>ⓣ</f>genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for <f>ⓤ</f>they are unprofitable and worthless.
Titus 3-10 As for a person who stirs up division, <f>ⓥ</f>after warning him once and then twice, <f>ⓦ</f>have nothing more to do with him,
Titus 3-11 knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.
Titus 3-12 <pb/>When I send Artemas or <f>ⓧ</f>Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me <f>ⓨ</f>at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Titus 3-13 Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and <f>ⓩ</f>Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.
Titus 3-14 And let our people learn <f>ⓐ</f>to devote themselves to good works, so as to help cases of urgent need, and not <f>ⓑ</f>be unfruitful.
Titus 3-15 <pb/>All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. <pb/><f>ⓒ</f>Grace be with you all.
