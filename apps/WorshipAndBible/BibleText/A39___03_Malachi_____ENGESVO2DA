Malachi 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “Behold, I send <f>ⓑ</f>my messenger, and <f>ⓒ</f>he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord <f>ⓓ</f>whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and <f>ⓔ</f>the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 3-2 But <f>ⓕ</f>who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For <f>ⓖ</f>he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap.
Malachi 3-3 He will sit <f>ⓗ</f>as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring <f>ⓘ</f>offerings in righteousness to the LORD. <f>[1]</f>
Malachi 3-4 <f>ⓙ</f> Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years.
Malachi 3-5 <pb/>“Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be <f>ⓚ</f>a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those <f>ⓛ</f>who oppress the hired worker in his wages, <f>ⓜ</f>the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 3-6 <pb/>“For <f>ⓝ</f>I the LORD do not change; <f>ⓞ</f>therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.
Malachi 3-7 <f>ⓟ</f> From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. <f>ⓠ</f>Return to me, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. <f>ⓡ</f>But you say, ‘How shall we return?’
Malachi 3-8 Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. <f>ⓢ</f>But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ <f>ⓣ</f>In your tithes and contributions.
Malachi 3-9 <f>ⓤ</f> You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you.
Malachi 3-10 <f>ⓥ</f> Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby <f>ⓦ</f>put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I will not open <f>ⓧ</f>the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.
Malachi 3-11 I will rebuke <f>ⓨ</f>the devourer <f>[2]</f> for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 3-12 Then <f>ⓩ</f>all nations will call you blessed, for you will be <f>ⓐ</f>a land of delight, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 3-13 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> “Your words have been hard against me, says the LORD. <f>ⓒ</f>But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’
Malachi 3-14 You have said, <f>ⓓ</f>‘It is vain to serve God. <f>ⓔ</f>What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the LORD of hosts?
Malachi 3-15 And now we call <f>ⓕ</f>the arrogant blessed. <f>ⓖ</f>Evildoers not only prosper but <f>ⓗ</f>they put God to the test and they escape.’”
Malachi 3-16 <pb/>Then those who feared the LORD <f>ⓘ</f>spoke with one another. The LORD paid attention and heard them, and <f>ⓙ</f>a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the LORD and esteemed his name.
Malachi 3-17 “They shall be mine, says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓚ</f>in the day when I make up <f>ⓛ</f>my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.
Malachi 3-18 Then once more you shall <f>ⓜ</f>see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.
