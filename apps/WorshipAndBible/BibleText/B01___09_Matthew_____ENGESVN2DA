Matthew 9-1 <pb/>And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to <f>ⓐ</f>his own city.
Matthew 9-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus <f>ⓒ</f>saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Take heart, my son; <f>ⓔ</f>your sins are forgiven.”</J>
Matthew 9-3 And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, <f>ⓕ</f>“This man is blaspheming.”
Matthew 9-4 But Jesus, <f>ⓖ</f>knowing <f>[1]</f> their thoughts, said, <J>“Why do you think evil in your hearts?</J>
Matthew 9-5 <J>For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?</J>
Matthew 9-6 <J>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</J> — he then said to the paralytic — <J>“Rise, pick up your bed and go home.”</J>
Matthew 9-7 And he rose and went home.
Matthew 9-8 When the crowds saw it, <f>ⓗ</f>they were afraid, and <f>ⓘ</f>they glorified God, who had <f>ⓙ</f>given such authority to men.
Matthew 9-9 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called <f>ⓛ</f>Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, <J>“Follow me.”</J> And he rose and followed him.
Matthew 9-10 <pb/>And as Jesus <f>[2]</f> reclined at table in the house, behold, many <f>ⓜ</f>tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples.
Matthew 9-11 And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, <f>ⓝ</f>“Why does your teacher eat with <f>ⓞ</f>tax collectors and sinners?”
Matthew 9-12 But when he heard it, he said, <J>“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</J>
Matthew 9-13 <J>Go and learn <f>ⓟ</f>what this means: <f>ⓠ</f>‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For <f>ⓡ</f>I came not to call the righteous, <f>ⓢ</f>but sinners.”</J>
Matthew 9-14 <pb/>Then <f>ⓣ</f>the disciples of John came to him, saying, <f>ⓤ</f>“Why do we and <f>ⓥ</f>the Pharisees fast, <f>[3]</f> but your disciples do not fast?”
Matthew 9-15 And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓦ</f>“Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? <f>ⓧ</f>The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and <f>ⓨ</f>then they will fast.</J>
Matthew 9-16 <J>No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.</J>
Matthew 9-17 <J>Neither is new wine put into old <f>ⓩ</f>wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.”</J>
Matthew 9-18 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and <f>ⓑ</f>knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
Matthew 9-19 And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples.
Matthew 9-20 And behold, a woman <f>ⓒ</f>who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched <f>ⓓ</f>the fringe of his garment,
Matthew 9-21 for she said to herself, “If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.”
Matthew 9-22 Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.”</J> <f>ⓕ</f>And instantly <f>[4]</f> the woman was made well.
Matthew 9-23 And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw <f>ⓖ</f>the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
Matthew 9-24 he said, <J>“Go away, for <f>ⓗ</f>the girl is not dead but <f>ⓘ</f>sleeping.”</J> And they laughed at him.
Matthew 9-25 But <f>ⓙ</f>when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and <f>ⓚ</f>took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
Matthew 9-26 And the report of this went through all that district.
Matthew 9-27 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, “Have mercy on us, <f>ⓜ</f>Son of David.”
Matthew 9-28 When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, <J>“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</J> They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”
Matthew 9-29 <f>ⓝ</f> Then he touched their eyes, saying, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“According to your faith be it done to you.”</J>
Matthew 9-30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“See that no one knows about it.”</J>
Matthew 9-31 <f>ⓠ</f> But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.
Matthew 9-32 <pb/>As they were going away, behold, a <f>ⓡ</f>demon-oppressed man who was mute <f>ⓢ</f>was brought to him.
Matthew 9-33 And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds <f>ⓣ</f>marveled, saying, “Never was anything like this seen in Israel.”
Matthew 9-34 But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the prince of demons.”
Matthew 9-35 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction.
Matthew 9-36 <f>ⓥ</f> When he saw the crowds, <f>ⓦ</f>he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, <f>ⓧ</f>like sheep without a shepherd.
Matthew 9-37 <f>ⓨ</f> Then he said to his disciples, <J>“The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;</J>
Matthew 9-38 <J>therefore <f>ⓩ</f>pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to <f>ⓐ</f>send out laborers into his harvest.”</J>
