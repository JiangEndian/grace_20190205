Romans 10-1 <pb/>Brothers, <f>[1]</f> my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
Romans 10-2 For I bear them witness that <f>ⓐ</f>they have a zeal for God, <f>ⓑ</f>but not according to knowledge.
Romans 10-3 For, being ignorant of <f>ⓒ</f>the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
Romans 10-4 For <f>ⓓ</f>Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. <f>[2]</f>
Romans 10-5 <pb/>For <f>ⓔ</f>Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that <f>ⓕ</f>the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
Romans 10-6 But <f>ⓖ</f>the righteousness based on faith says, <f>ⓗ</f>“Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)
Romans 10-7 “or ‘Who will descend into the <f>ⓘ</f>abyss?’” (that is, <f>ⓙ</f>to bring Christ up from the dead).
Romans 10-8 But what does it say? <f>ⓚ</f>“The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);
Romans 10-9 because, if <f>ⓛ</f>you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and <f>ⓜ</f>believe in your heart <f>ⓝ</f>that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Romans 10-10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
Romans 10-11 For the Scripture says, <f>ⓞ</f>“Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”
Romans 10-12 <f>ⓟ</f> For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; <f>ⓠ</f>for the same Lord is Lord of all, <f>ⓡ</f>bestowing his riches on all who call on him.
Romans 10-13 For <f>ⓢ</f>“everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
Romans 10-14 <pb/>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him <f>ⓣ</f>of whom they have never heard? <f>[3]</f> And how are they to hear <f>ⓤ</f>without someone preaching?
Romans 10-15 And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, <f>ⓥ</f>“How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!”
Romans 10-16 But <f>ⓦ</f>they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, <f>ⓧ</f>“Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?”
Romans 10-17 So <f>ⓨ</f>faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.
Romans 10-18 <pb/>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f>“Their voice has gone out <f>ⓐ</f>to all the earth, </t><t>and their words to the ends of the world.” </t>
Romans 10-19 <pb/>But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f>“I will <f>ⓒ</f>make you jealous of those who are not a nation; </t><t>with a <f>ⓓ</f>foolish nation I will make you angry.” </t>
Romans 10-20 <pb/>Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f>“I have been found by those who did not seek me; </t><t>I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.” </t>
Romans 10-21 <pb/>But of Israel he says, <f>ⓕ</f>“All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”
