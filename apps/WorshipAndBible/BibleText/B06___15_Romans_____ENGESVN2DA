Romans 15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> We who are strong <f>ⓑ</f>have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
Romans 15-2 <f>ⓒ</f> Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.
Romans 15-3 For <f>ⓓ</f>Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, <f>ⓔ</f>“The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.”
Romans 15-4 For <f>ⓕ</f>whatever was written in former days was written for our <f>ⓖ</f>instruction, that through endurance and through <f>ⓗ</f>the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
Romans 15-5 May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you <f>ⓘ</f>to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,
Romans 15-6 that together you may with one voice glorify <f>ⓙ</f>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 15-7 Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.
Romans 15-8 <pb/>For I tell you that Christ <f>ⓚ</f>became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order <f>ⓛ</f>to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,
Romans 15-9 and in order <f>ⓜ</f>that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, </t><t>and sing to your name.” </t>
Romans 15-10 <pb/>And again it is said, <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.” </t>
Romans 15-11 <pb/>And again, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f>“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, </t><t>and let all the peoples extol him.” </t>
Romans 15-12 <pb/>And again Isaiah says, <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> <f>ⓡ</f>“The root of Jesse will come, </t><t>even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>in him will the Gentiles hope.” </t>
Romans 15-13 <pb/>May the God of hope fill you with all <f>ⓣ</f>joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.
Romans 15-14 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, <f>[1]</f> that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with <f>ⓥ</f>all knowledge and able to instruct one another.
Romans 15-15 But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, <f>ⓦ</f>because of the grace given me by God
Romans 15-16 to be <f>ⓧ</f>a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles <f>ⓨ</f>in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that <f>ⓩ</f>the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Romans 15-17 In Christ Jesus, then, I have <f>ⓐ</f>reason to be proud of <f>ⓑ</f>my work for God.
Romans 15-18 For I will not venture to speak of anything except <f>ⓒ</f>what Christ has accomplished through me <f>ⓓ</f>to bring the Gentiles to obedience — by word and deed,
Romans 15-19 <f>ⓔ</f> by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God — so that <f>ⓕ</f>from Jerusalem and all the way around <f>ⓖ</f>to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ;
Romans 15-20 and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, <f>ⓗ</f>lest I build on someone else's foundation,
Romans 15-21 but as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f>“Those who have never been told of him will see, </t><t>and those who have never heard will understand.” </t>
Romans 15-22 <pb/>This is the reason why <f>ⓙ</f>I have so often been hindered from coming to you.
Romans 15-23 But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and <f>ⓚ</f>since I have longed for many years to come to you,
Romans 15-24 I hope to see you in passing as I go <f>ⓛ</f>to Spain, and <f>ⓜ</f>to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while.
Romans 15-25 At present, however, <f>ⓝ</f>I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints.
Romans 15-26 For <f>ⓞ</f>Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.
Romans 15-27 For they were pleased to do it, and indeed <f>ⓟ</f>they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.
Romans 15-28 When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected, <f>[2]</f> I will leave <f>ⓠ</f>for Spain by way of you.
Romans 15-29 I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing <f>[3]</f> of Christ.
Romans 15-30 <pb/>I appeal to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by <f>ⓡ</f>the love of the Spirit, <f>ⓢ</f>to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,
Romans 15-31 <f>ⓣ</f> that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that <f>ⓤ</f>my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
Romans 15-32 so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and <f>ⓥ</f>be refreshed in your company.
Romans 15-33 May <f>ⓦ</f>the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
