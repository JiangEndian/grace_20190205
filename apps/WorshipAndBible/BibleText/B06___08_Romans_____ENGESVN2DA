Romans 8-1 <pb/>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. <f>[1]</f>
Romans 8-2 For the law of <f>ⓐ</f>the Spirit of life <f>ⓑ</f>has set you <f>[2]</f> free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.
Romans 8-3 For <f>ⓒ</f>God has done what the law, <f>ⓓ</f>weakened by the flesh, <f>ⓔ</f>could not do. <f>ⓕ</f>By sending his own Son <f>ⓖ</f>in the likeness of sinful flesh and <f>ⓗ</f>for sin, <f>[3]</f> he condemned sin in the flesh,
Romans 8-4 in order that <f>ⓘ</f>the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, <f>ⓙ</f>who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
Romans 8-5 For <f>ⓚ</f>those who live according to the flesh set their minds on <f>ⓛ</f>the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on <f>ⓜ</f>the things of the Spirit.
Romans 8-6 For to set <f>ⓝ</f>the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
Romans 8-7 For the mind that is set on the flesh is <f>ⓞ</f>hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; <f>ⓟ</f>indeed, it cannot.
Romans 8-8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
Romans 8-9 <pb/>You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact <f>ⓠ</f>the Spirit of God dwells in you. <f>ⓡ</f>Anyone who does not have <f>ⓢ</f>the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.
Romans 8-10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
Romans 8-11 If the Spirit of <f>ⓣ</f>him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus <f>[4]</f> from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies <f>ⓤ</f>through his Spirit who dwells in you.
Romans 8-12 <pb/>So then, brothers, <f>[5]</f> we are debtors, <f>ⓥ</f>not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
Romans 8-13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you <f>ⓦ</f>put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
Romans 8-14 For all who are <f>ⓧ</f>led by the Spirit of God are <f>ⓨ</f>sons <f>[6]</f> of God.
Romans 8-15 For <f>ⓩ</f>you did not receive <f>ⓐ</f>the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of <f>ⓑ</f>adoption as sons, by whom we cry, <f>ⓒ</f>“Abba! Father!”
Romans 8-16 <f>ⓓ</f> The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
Romans 8-17 and if children, then <f>ⓔ</f>heirs — heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, <f>ⓕ</f>provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.
Romans 8-18 <pb/>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time <f>ⓖ</f>are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
Romans 8-19 For the creation waits with eager longing for <f>ⓗ</f>the revealing of the sons of God.
Romans 8-20 For the creation <f>ⓘ</f>was subjected to futility, not willingly, but <f>ⓙ</f>because of him who subjected it, in hope
Romans 8-21 that <f>ⓚ</f>the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
Romans 8-22 For we know that <f>ⓛ</f>the whole creation <f>ⓜ</f>has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.
Romans 8-23 And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have <f>ⓝ</f>the firstfruits of the Spirit, <f>ⓞ</f>groan inwardly as <f>ⓟ</f>we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, <f>ⓠ</f>the redemption of our bodies.
Romans 8-24 For <f>ⓡ</f>in this hope we were saved. Now <f>ⓢ</f>hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?
Romans 8-25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we <f>ⓣ</f>wait for it with patience.
Romans 8-26 <pb/>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For <f>ⓤ</f>we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but <f>ⓥ</f>the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
Romans 8-27 And <f>ⓦ</f>he who searches hearts knows what is <f>ⓧ</f>the mind of the Spirit, because <f>[7]</f> the Spirit <f>ⓨ</f>intercedes for the saints <f>ⓩ</f>according to the will of God.
Romans 8-28 And we know that for those who love God all things work together <f>ⓐ</f>for good, <f>[8]</f> for <f>ⓑ</f>those who are called according to his purpose.
Romans 8-29 For those whom he <f>ⓒ</f>foreknew he also <f>ⓓ</f>predestined <f>ⓔ</f>to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be <f>ⓕ</f>the firstborn among many brothers.
Romans 8-30 And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also <f>ⓖ</f>justified, and those whom he justified he also <f>ⓗ</f>glorified.
Romans 8-31 <pb/>What then shall we say to these things? <f>ⓘ</f>If God is for us, who can be <f>[9]</f> against us?
Romans 8-32 <f>ⓙ</f> He who did not spare his own Son but <f>ⓚ</f>gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
Romans 8-33 Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? <f>ⓛ</f>It is God who justifies.
Romans 8-34 <f>ⓜ</f> Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died — more than that, who was raised — <f>ⓝ</f>who is at the right hand of God, <f>ⓞ</f>who indeed is interceding for us. <f>[10]</f>
Romans 8-35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
Romans 8-36 As it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f>“For your sake <f>ⓠ</f>we are being killed all the day long; </t><t>we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” </t>
Romans 8-37 <pb/>No, in all these things we are more than <f>ⓡ</f>conquerors through <f>ⓢ</f>him who loved us.
Romans 8-38 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
Romans 8-39 nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
