1 Corinthians 14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Pursue love, and <f>ⓑ</f>earnestly desire the <f>ⓒ</f>spiritual gifts, especially that you may <f>ⓓ</f>prophesy.
1 Corinthians 14-2 For <f>ⓔ</f>one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit.
1 Corinthians 14-3 On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation.
1 Corinthians 14-4 The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
1 Corinthians 14-5 Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but <f>ⓕ</f>even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.
1 Corinthians 14-6 <pb/>Now, brothers, <f>[1]</f> if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some <f>ⓖ</f>revelation or knowledge or prophecy or <f>ⓗ</f>teaching?
1 Corinthians 14-7 If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played?
1 Corinthians 14-8 And <f>ⓘ</f>if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?
1 Corinthians 14-9 So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be <f>ⓙ</f>speaking into the air.
1 Corinthians 14-10 There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning,
1 Corinthians 14-11 but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be <f>ⓚ</f>a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.
1 Corinthians 14-12 So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.
1 Corinthians 14-13 <pb/>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians 14-14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.
1 Corinthians 14-15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; <f>ⓛ</f>I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will <f>ⓜ</f>sing with my mind also.
1 Corinthians 14-16 Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider <f>[2]</f> say <f>ⓝ</f>“Amen” to <f>ⓞ</f>your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?
1 Corinthians 14-17 For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.
1 Corinthians 14-18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
1 Corinthians 14-19 Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1 Corinthians 14-20 <pb/>Brothers, <f>ⓟ</f>do not be children in your thinking. <f>ⓠ</f>Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be <f>ⓡ</f>mature.
1 Corinthians 14-21 <f>ⓢ</f> In the Law it is written, <f>ⓣ</f>“By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”
1 Corinthians 14-22 Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign <f>[3]</f> not for unbelievers but for believers.
1 Corinthians 14-23 If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, <f>ⓤ</f>will they not say that you are out of your minds?
1 Corinthians 14-24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,
1 Corinthians 14-25 <f>ⓥ</f> the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, <f>ⓦ</f>falling on his face, he will worship God and <f>ⓧ</f>declare that God is really among you.
1 Corinthians 14-26 <pb/>What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has <f>ⓨ</f>a hymn, <f>ⓩ</f>a lesson, <f>ⓐ</f>a revelation, <f>ⓑ</f>a tongue, or <f>ⓒ</f>an interpretation. <f>ⓓ</f>Let all things be done for building up.
1 Corinthians 14-27 If any speak in <f>ⓔ</f>a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret.
1 Corinthians 14-28 But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God.
1 Corinthians 14-29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others <f>ⓕ</f>weigh what is said.
1 Corinthians 14-30 If a revelation is made to another sitting there, <f>ⓖ</f>let the first be silent.
1 Corinthians 14-31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged,
1 Corinthians 14-32 and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
1 Corinthians 14-33 For God is not a God of <f>ⓗ</f>confusion but of peace. <pb/>As in <f>ⓘ</f>all the churches of the saints,
1 Corinthians 14-34 <f>ⓙ</f> the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but <f>ⓚ</f>should be in submission, as <f>ⓛ</f>the Law also says.
1 Corinthians 14-35 If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.
1 Corinthians 14-36 <pb/>Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
1 Corinthians 14-37 <f>ⓜ</f> If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.
1 Corinthians 14-38 If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.
1 Corinthians 14-39 So, my brothers, <f>ⓝ</f>earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
1 Corinthians 14-40 <f>ⓞ</f> But all things should be done decently and <f>ⓟ</f>in order.
