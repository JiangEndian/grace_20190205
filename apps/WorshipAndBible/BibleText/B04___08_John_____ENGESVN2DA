John 8-1 <pb/>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
John 8-2 <f>ⓐ</f> Early in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him, and <f>ⓑ</f>he sat down and taught them.
John 8-3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst
John 8-4 they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.
John 8-5 Now <f>ⓒ</f>in the Law, Moses commanded us <f>ⓓ</f>to stone such women. So what do you say?”
John 8-6 This they said <f>ⓔ</f>to test him, <f>ⓕ</f>that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.
John 8-7 And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Let him who is without sin among you <f>ⓗ</f>be the first to throw a stone at her.”</J>
John 8-8 And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground.
John 8-9 But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.
John 8-10 Jesus stood up and said to her, <J>“Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”</J>
John 8-11 She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on <f>ⓙ</f>sin no more.”</J>]]
John 8-12 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“I am the light of the world. Whoever <f>ⓜ</f>follows me will not <f>ⓝ</f>walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</J>
John 8-13 So the Pharisees said to him, <f>ⓞ</f>“You are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.”
John 8-14 Jesus answered, <J>“Even if I do bear witness about myself, <f>ⓟ</f>my testimony is true, for I know <f>ⓠ</f>where I came from and <f>ⓡ</f>where I am going, but <f>ⓢ</f>you do not know where I come from or where I am going.</J>
John 8-15 <J><f>ⓣ</f> You judge according to the flesh; <f>ⓤ</f>I judge no one.</J>
John 8-16 <J>Yet even if I do judge, <f>ⓥ</f>my judgment is true, for <f>ⓦ</f>it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father <f>[1]</f> who sent me.</J>
John 8-17 <J><f>ⓧ</f> In your Law it is written that the testimony of two people is true.</J>
John 8-18 <J>I am the one who bears witness about myself, and <f>ⓨ</f>the Father who sent me bears witness about me.”</J>
John 8-19 They said to him therefore, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓩ</f>“You know neither me nor my Father. <f>ⓐ</f>If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”</J>
John 8-20 These words he spoke in <f>ⓑ</f>the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but <f>ⓒ</f>no one arrested him, because <f>ⓓ</f>his hour had not yet come.
John 8-21 <pb/>So he said to them again, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“I am going away, and <f>ⓕ</f>you will seek me, and <f>ⓖ</f>you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”</J>
John 8-22 So the Jews said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Will he kill himself, since he says, <J>‘Where I am going, you cannot come’</J>?”
John 8-23 He said to them, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“You are from below; I am from above. <f>ⓙ</f>You are of this world; <f>ⓚ</f>I am not of this world.</J>
John 8-24 <J>I told you that you <f>ⓛ</f>would die in your sins, for <f>ⓜ</f>unless you believe that <f>ⓝ</f>I am he you will die in your sins.”</J>
John 8-25 So they said to him, <f>ⓞ</f>“Who are you?” Jesus said to them, <J>“Just what I have been telling you from the beginning.</J>
John 8-26 <J>I have much to say about you and much to judge, but <f>ⓟ</f>he who sent me is true, and I declare <f>ⓠ</f>to the world <f>ⓡ</f>what I have heard from him.”</J>
John 8-27 They did not understand that <f>ⓢ</f>he had been speaking to them about the Father.
John 8-28 So Jesus said to them, <J>“When you have <f>ⓣ</f>lifted up the Son of Man, <f>ⓤ</f>then you will know that <f>ⓥ</f>I am he, and that <f>ⓦ</f>I do nothing on my own authority, but <f>ⓧ</f>speak just as the Father taught me.</J>
John 8-29 <J>And <f>ⓨ</f>he who sent me is with me. <f>ⓩ</f>He has not left me alone, for <f>ⓐ</f>I always do the things that are pleasing to him.”</J>
John 8-30 As he was saying these things, <f>ⓑ</f>many believed in him.
John 8-31 <pb/>So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,</J>
John 8-32 <J>and you will <f>ⓓ</f>know the truth, and the truth <f>ⓔ</f>will set you free.”</J>
John 8-33 They answered him, <f>ⓕ</f>“We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, ‘You will become free’?”
John 8-34 <pb/>Jesus answered them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓖ</f>everyone who practices sin is a slave <f>[2]</f> to sin.</J>
John 8-35 <J><f>ⓗ</f> The slave does not remain in the house forever; <f>ⓘ</f>the son remains forever.</J>
John 8-36 <J>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</J>
John 8-37 <J>I know that you are offspring of Abraham; yet <f>ⓙ</f>you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you.</J>
John 8-38 <J><f>ⓚ</f> I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard <f>ⓛ</f>from your father.”</J>
John 8-39 <pb/>They answered him, <f>ⓜ</f>“Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works Abraham did,</J>
John 8-40 <J>but now <f>ⓞ</f>you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth <f>ⓟ</f>that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.</J>
John 8-41 <J>You are doing the works your father did.”</J> They said to him, <f>ⓠ</f>“We were not born of sexual immorality. We have <f>ⓡ</f>one Father — even God.”
John 8-42 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“If God were your Father, you would love me, for <f>ⓣ</f>I came from God and <f>ⓤ</f>I am here. <f>ⓥ</f>I came not of my own accord, but <f>ⓦ</f>he sent me.</J>
John 8-43 <J><f>ⓧ</f> Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot <f>ⓨ</f>bear to hear my word.</J>
John 8-44 <J><f>ⓩ</f> You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. <f>ⓐ</f>He was a murderer from the beginning, and <f>ⓑ</f>does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. <f>ⓒ</f>When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</J>
John 8-45 <J>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</J>
John 8-46 <J>Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</J>
John 8-47 <J><f>ⓓ</f> Whoever is of God hears the words of God. <f>ⓔ</f>The reason why you do not hear them is that <f>ⓕ</f>you are not of God.”</J>
John 8-48 <pb/>The Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and <f>ⓖ</f>have a demon?”
John 8-49 Jesus answered, <J>“I do not have a demon, but <f>ⓗ</f>I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</J>
John 8-50 <J>Yet <f>ⓘ</f>I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge.</J>
John 8-51 <J>Truly, truly, <f>ⓙ</f>I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never <f>ⓚ</f>see death.”</J>
John 8-52 The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! <f>ⓛ</f>Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet <f>ⓜ</f>you say, <J>‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never <f>ⓝ</f>taste death.’</J>
John 8-53 <f>ⓞ</f> Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?”
John 8-54 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. <f>ⓠ</f>It is my Father who glorifies me, <f>ⓡ</f>of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’ <f>[3]</f></J>
John 8-55 <J>But <f>ⓢ</f>you have not known him. <f>ⓣ</f>I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be <f>ⓤ</f>a liar <f>ⓥ</f>like you, but I do know him and I keep his word.</J>
John 8-56 <J><f>ⓦ</f> Your father Abraham <f>ⓧ</f>rejoiced <f>ⓨ</f>that he would see my day. <f>ⓩ</f>He saw it and was glad.”</J>
John 8-57 So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?” <f>[4]</f>
John 8-58 Jesus said to them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, <f>ⓐ</f>I am.”</J>
John 8-59 So <f>ⓑ</f>they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.
