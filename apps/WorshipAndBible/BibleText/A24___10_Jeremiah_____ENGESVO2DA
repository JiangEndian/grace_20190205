Jeremiah 10-3 <t><f>ⓐ</f> for the customs of the peoples are vanity. <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>A tree from the forest is cut down </t><t>and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman.</t>
Jeremiah 10-4 <t><f>ⓒ</f> They decorate it with silver and gold; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>they fasten it with hammer and nails </t><t>so that it cannot move.</t>
Jeremiah 10-5 <t>Their idols <f>[2]</f> are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>they cannot speak; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>they have to be carried, </t><t>for they cannot walk. </t><t>Do not be afraid of them, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>for they cannot do evil, </t><t>neither is it in them to do good.” </t>

Jeremiah 10-9 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Beaten silver is brought from <f>ⓜ</f>Tarshish, </t><t>and gold from <f>ⓝ</f>Uphaz. </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; </t><t>their clothing is violet and purple; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>they are all the work of skilled men.</t>
Jeremiah 10-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> But the LORD is the true God; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>he is the living God and the everlasting King. </t><t>At his wrath the earth quakes, </t><t>and the nations cannot endure his indignation. </t>

Jeremiah 10-13 <t><f>ⓨ</f> When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>He makes lightning <f>ⓑ</f>for the rain, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and he brings forth the wind <f>ⓓ</f>from his storehouses.</t>
Jeremiah 10-14 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Every man is stupid and without knowledge; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, </t><t>for his images are false, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>and there is no breath in them.</t>
Jeremiah 10-15 <t>They are worthless, a work of delusion; </t><t>at the time of their punishment they shall perish.</t>

Jeremiah 10-21 <t><f>ⓡ</f> For the shepherds <f>ⓢ</f>are stupid </t><t>and do not inquire of the LORD; </t><t>therefore they have not prospered, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>and all their flock is scattered. </t>
Jeremiah 10-22 <pb/><t>A voice, a rumor! Behold, it comes! — </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>a great commotion out of the north country </t><t>to make <f>ⓥ</f>the cities of Judah a desolation, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>a lair of jackals. </t>
