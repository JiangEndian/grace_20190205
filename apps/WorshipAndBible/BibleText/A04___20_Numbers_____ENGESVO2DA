Numbers 20-1 <pb/>And the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came <f>ⓐ</f>into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh. And <f>ⓑ</f>Miriam died there and was buried there.
Numbers 20-2 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> Now there was no water for the congregation. <f>ⓓ</f>And they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
Numbers 20-3 And the people <f>ⓔ</f>quarreled with Moses and said, “Would that we had perished <f>ⓕ</f>when our brothers perished before the LORD!
Numbers 20-4 Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we should die here, both we and our cattle?
Numbers 20-5 And <f>ⓖ</f>why have you made us come up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.”
Numbers 20-6 Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and <f>ⓗ</f>fell on their faces. <f>ⓘ</f>And the glory of the LORD appeared to them,
Numbers 20-7 and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 20-8 <f>ⓙ</f> “Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water. So <f>ⓚ</f>you shall bring water out of the rock for them and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.”
Numbers 20-9 And Moses took the staff <f>ⓛ</f>from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
Numbers 20-10 <pb/>Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, <f>ⓜ</f>“Hear now, you rebels: shall we bring water for you out of this rock?”
Numbers 20-11 And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice, <f>ⓝ</f>and water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.
Numbers 20-12 And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because <f>ⓞ</f>you did not believe in me, <f>ⓟ</f>to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.”
Numbers 20-13 <f>ⓠ</f> These are the waters of Meribah, <f>[1]</f> where the people of Israel quarreled with the LORD, and through them he showed himself holy.
Numbers 20-14 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to <f>ⓢ</f>the king of Edom: “Thus says <f>ⓣ</f>your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that we have met:
Numbers 20-15 <f>ⓤ</f> how our fathers went down to Egypt, <f>ⓥ</f>and we lived in Egypt a long time. <f>ⓦ</f>And the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers.
Numbers 20-16 And <f>ⓧ</f>when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice and <f>ⓨ</f>sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. And here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory.
Numbers 20-17 <f>ⓩ</f> Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, <f>ⓐ</f>or drink water from a well. We will go along the King's Highway. We will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.”
Numbers 20-18 But Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through, lest I come out with the sword against you.”
Numbers 20-19 And the people of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway, <f>ⓑ</f>and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, <f>ⓒ</f>then I will pay for it. Let me only pass through on foot, nothing more.”
Numbers 20-20 But he said, <f>ⓓ</f>“You shall not pass through.” And Edom came out against them with a large army and with a strong force.
Numbers 20-21 Thus Edom <f>ⓔ</f>refused to give Israel passage through his territory, so Israel <f>ⓕ</f>turned away from him.
Numbers 20-22 <pb/>And they journeyed from <f>ⓖ</f>Kadesh, and the people of Israel, the whole congregation, came to <f>ⓗ</f>Mount Hor.
Numbers 20-23 And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom,
Numbers 20-24 <f>ⓘ</f> “Let Aaron be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land that I have given to the people of Israel, because <f>ⓙ</f>you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.
Numbers 20-25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount Hor.
Numbers 20-26 And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron <f>ⓚ</f>shall be gathered to his people and shall die there.”
Numbers 20-27 Moses did as the LORD commanded. And they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers 20-28 <f>ⓛ</f> And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there <f>ⓜ</f>on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
Numbers 20-29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had perished, <f>ⓝ</f>all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
