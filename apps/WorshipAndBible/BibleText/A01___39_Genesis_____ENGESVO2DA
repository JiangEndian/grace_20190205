Genesis 39-1 <pb/>Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and <f>ⓐ</f>Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, <f>ⓑ</f>had bought him from the <f>ⓒ</f>Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
Genesis 39-2 <f>ⓓ</f> The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
Genesis 39-3 His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD <f>ⓔ</f>caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.
Genesis 39-4 So Joseph <f>ⓕ</f>found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house <f>ⓖ</f>and put him in charge of all that he had.
Genesis 39-5 From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house <f>ⓗ</f>for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had, in house and field.
Genesis 39-6 So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge, and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate. <pb/>Now Joseph was <f>ⓘ</f>handsome in form and appearance.
Genesis 39-7 And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, “Lie with me.”
Genesis 39-8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, “Behold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and <f>ⓙ</f>he has put everything that he has in my charge.
Genesis 39-9 He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and <f>ⓚ</f>sin against God?”
Genesis 39-10 And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he <f>ⓛ</f>would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.
Genesis 39-11 <pb/>But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,
Genesis 39-12 <f>ⓜ</f> she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house.
Genesis 39-13 And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house,
Genesis 39-14 she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.
Genesis 39-15 And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house.”
Genesis 39-16 Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,
Genesis 39-17 and she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me.
Genesis 39-18 But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house.”
Genesis 39-19 <pb/>As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, “This is the way your servant treated me,” his anger was kindled.
Genesis 39-20 And Joseph's master took him and <f>ⓝ</f>put him into the <f>ⓞ</f>prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.
Genesis 39-21 But <f>ⓟ</f>the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love <f>ⓠ</f>and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
Genesis 39-22 And the keeper of the prison <f>ⓡ</f>put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.
Genesis 39-23 The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph's charge, because <f>ⓢ</f>the LORD was with him. And whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.
