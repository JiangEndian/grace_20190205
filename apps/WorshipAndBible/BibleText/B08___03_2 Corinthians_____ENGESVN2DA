2 Corinthians 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, <f>ⓑ</f>as some do, <f>ⓒ</f>letters of recommendation to you, or from you?
2 Corinthians 3-2 <f>ⓓ</f> You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our <f>[1]</f> hearts, to be known and read by all.
2 Corinthians 3-3 And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of <f>ⓔ</f>the living God, not on <f>ⓕ</f>tablets of stone but on <f>ⓖ</f>tablets of <f>ⓗ</f>human hearts. <f>[2]</f>
2 Corinthians 3-4 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
2 Corinthians 3-5 <f>ⓙ</f> Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but <f>ⓚ</f>our sufficiency is from God,
2 Corinthians 3-6 who has made us sufficient to be <f>ⓛ</f>ministers of <f>ⓜ</f>a new covenant, not of <f>ⓝ</f>the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but <f>ⓞ</f>the Spirit gives life.
2 Corinthians 3-7 <pb/>Now if <f>ⓟ</f>the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory <f>ⓠ</f>that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end,
2 Corinthians 3-8 will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?
2 Corinthians 3-9 For if there was glory in <f>ⓡ</f>the ministry of condemnation, <f>ⓢ</f>the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory.
2 Corinthians 3-10 Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it.
2 Corinthians 3-11 For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.
2 Corinthians 3-12 <pb/>Since we have such a hope, <f>ⓣ</f>we are very bold,
2 Corinthians 3-13 not like Moses, <f>ⓤ</f>who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end.
2 Corinthians 3-14 But <f>ⓥ</f>their minds were <f>ⓦ</f>hardened. For to this day, <f>ⓧ</f>when they read <f>ⓨ</f>the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away.
2 Corinthians 3-15 Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts.
2 Corinthians 3-16 But when <f>ⓩ</f>one <f>[3]</f> turns to the Lord, <f>ⓐ</f>the veil is removed.
2 Corinthians 3-17 Now the Lord <f>[4]</f> is the Spirit, and where <f>ⓑ</f>the Spirit of the Lord is, there is <f>ⓒ</f>freedom.
2 Corinthians 3-18 And we all, with unveiled face, <f>ⓓ</f>beholding <f>ⓔ</f>the glory of the Lord, <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>are being transformed into the same image <f>ⓖ</f>from one degree of glory to another. <f>[6]</f> For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.
