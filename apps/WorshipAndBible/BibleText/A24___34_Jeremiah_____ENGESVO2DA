Jeremiah 34-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when <f>ⓐ</f>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army <f>ⓑ</f>and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:
Jeremiah 34-2 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to <f>ⓒ</f>Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓓ</f>Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
Jeremiah 34-3 <f>ⓔ</f> You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. <f>ⓕ</f>You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.’
Jeremiah 34-4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! <f>ⓖ</f>Thus says the LORD concerning you: <f>ⓗ</f>‘You shall not die by the sword.
Jeremiah 34-5 You shall die in peace. <f>ⓘ</f>And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall <f>ⓙ</f>burn spices for you <f>ⓚ</f>and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!”’ For I have spoken the word, declares the LORD.”
Jeremiah 34-6 <pb/>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
Jeremiah 34-7 when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, <f>ⓛ</f>Lachish and <f>ⓜ</f>Azekah, <f>ⓝ</f>for these were the only <f>ⓞ</f>fortified cities of Judah that remained.
Jeremiah 34-8 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah <f>ⓟ</f>had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem <f>ⓠ</f>to make a proclamation of liberty to them,
Jeremiah 34-9 <f>ⓡ</f> that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, <f>ⓢ</f>so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother.
Jeremiah 34-10 And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free.
Jeremiah 34-11 But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves <f>ⓣ</f>they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.
Jeremiah 34-12 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 34-13 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when <f>ⓤ</f>I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,
Jeremiah 34-14 <f>ⓥ</f> ‘At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; <f>ⓦ</f>you must set him free from your service.’ But <f>ⓧ</f>your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.
Jeremiah 34-15 You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes <f>ⓨ</f>by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and <f>ⓩ</f>you made a covenant before me in the <f>ⓐ</f>house that is called by my name,
Jeremiah 34-16 but then you turned around <f>ⓑ</f>and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, <f>ⓒ</f>whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.
Jeremiah 34-17 <pb/>“Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me <f>ⓓ</f>by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; <f>ⓔ</f>behold, I proclaim to you liberty <f>ⓕ</f>to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the LORD. <f>ⓖ</f>I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
Jeremiah 34-18 And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of <f>ⓗ</f>the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts —
Jeremiah 34-19 the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, <f>ⓙ</f>the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf.
Jeremiah 34-20 And I will give them into the hand of their enemies <f>ⓚ</f>and into the hand of those who seek their lives. <f>ⓛ</f>Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah 34-21 And <f>ⓜ</f>Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon <f>ⓝ</f>which has withdrawn from you.
Jeremiah 34-22 Behold, <f>ⓞ</f>I will command, declares the LORD, and will <f>ⓟ</f>bring them back to this city. <f>ⓠ</f>And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. <f>ⓡ</f>I will make the cities of Judah a desolation <f>ⓢ</f>without inhabitant.”
