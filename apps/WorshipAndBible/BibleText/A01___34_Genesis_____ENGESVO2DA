Genesis 34-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land.
Genesis 34-2 And when Shechem the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her.
Genesis 34-3 And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.
Genesis 34-4 So Shechem <f>ⓒ</f>spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this girl for my wife.”
Genesis 34-5 <pb/>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came.
Genesis 34-6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
Genesis 34-7 The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and <f>ⓓ</f>very angry, because he <f>ⓔ</f>had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, <f>ⓕ</f>for such a thing must not be done.
Genesis 34-8 <pb/>But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your <f>[1]</f> daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife.
Genesis 34-9 Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
Genesis 34-10 You shall dwell with us, and <f>ⓖ</f>the land shall be open to you. Dwell and <f>ⓗ</f>trade in it, and <f>ⓘ</f>get property in it.”
Genesis 34-11 Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, <f>ⓙ</f>“Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.
Genesis 34-12 Ask me for as great a <f>ⓚ</f>bride-price <f>[2]</f> and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.”
Genesis 34-13 <pb/>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
Genesis 34-14 They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for <f>ⓛ</f>that would be a disgrace to us.
Genesis 34-15 Only on this condition will we agree with you — that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised.
Genesis 34-16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people.
Genesis 34-17 But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.”
Genesis 34-18 <pb/>Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.
Genesis 34-19 And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now <f>ⓜ</f>he was the most honored of all his father's house.
Genesis 34-20 So Hamor and his son Shechem <f>ⓝ</f>came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
Genesis 34-21 “These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and <f>ⓞ</f>trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Genesis 34-22 Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people — when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.
Genesis 34-23 Will not their livestock, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us.”
Genesis 34-24 And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who <f>ⓟ</f>went out of the gate of his city.
Genesis 34-25 <pb/>On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, <f>ⓠ</f>Simeon and Levi, <f>ⓡ</f>Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males.
Genesis 34-26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went away.
Genesis 34-27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
Genesis 34-28 They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.
Genesis 34-29 All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered.
Genesis 34-30 <pb/>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, <f>ⓢ</f>“You have brought trouble on me <f>ⓣ</f>by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, <f>ⓤ</f>the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <f>ⓥ</f>My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.”
Genesis 34-31 But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”
