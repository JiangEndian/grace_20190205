Revelation 13-1 <pb/>And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, <f>ⓐ</f>with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and <f>ⓑ</f>blasphemous names on its heads.
Revelation 13-2 And the beast that I saw was <f>ⓒ</f>like a leopard; its feet were like <f>ⓓ</f>a bear's, and its mouth was like <f>ⓔ</f>a lion's mouth. And to it <f>ⓕ</f>the dragon gave his power and <f>ⓖ</f>his throne and great authority.
Revelation 13-3 One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and <f>ⓗ</f>the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.
Revelation 13-4 And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, <f>ⓘ</f>“Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”
Revelation 13-5 <pb/>And the beast was given <f>ⓙ</f>a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for <f>ⓚ</f>forty-two months.
Revelation 13-6 It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, <f>[1]</f> that is, those who dwell in heaven.
Revelation 13-7 Also it was allowed <f>ⓛ</f>to make war on the saints and to conquer them. <f>[2]</f> And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation,
Revelation 13-8 and all <f>ⓜ</f>who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in <f>ⓝ</f>the book of life of <f>ⓞ</f>the Lamb <f>ⓟ</f>who was slain.
Revelation 13-9 <f>ⓠ</f> If anyone has an ear, let him hear:
Revelation 13-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f> If anyone is to be taken captive, </t><t>to captivity he goes; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>if anyone is to be slain with the sword, </t><t>with the sword must he be slain. </t> <pb/><f>ⓣ</f>Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.
Revelation 13-11 <pb/>Then <f>ⓤ</f>I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.
Revelation 13-12 It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, <f>[3]</f> and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, <f>ⓥ</f>whose mortal wound was healed.
Revelation 13-13 <f>ⓦ</f> It performs great signs, even <f>ⓧ</f>making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people,
Revelation 13-14 and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of <f>[4]</f> the beast <f>ⓨ</f>it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast <f>ⓩ</f>that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
Revelation 13-15 And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not <f>ⓐ</f>worship the image of the beast <f>ⓑ</f>to be slain.
Revelation 13-16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,
Revelation 13-17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, <f>ⓓ</f>the name of the beast or <f>ⓔ</f>the number of its name.
Revelation 13-18 <f>ⓕ</f> This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number <f>ⓖ</f>of a man, and his number is 666. <f>[6]</f>
