Hebrews 4-1 <pb/>Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem <f>ⓐ</f>to have failed to reach it.
Hebrews 4-2 For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because <f>ⓑ</f>they were not united by faith with those who listened. <f>[1]</f>
Hebrews 4-3 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“As I swore in my wrath, </t><t>‘They shall not enter my rest,’” </t> <pb/>although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.
Hebrews 4-4 For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: <f>ⓓ</f>“And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”
Hebrews 4-5 And again in this passage he said, <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f>“They shall not enter my rest.” </t>
Hebrews 4-6 <pb/>Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news <f>ⓕ</f>failed to enter because of disobedience,
Hebrews 4-7 again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“Today, if you hear his voice, </t><t>do not harden your hearts.” </t>
Hebrews 4-8 <pb/>For if Joshua had given them rest, God <f>[2]</f> would not have spoken of another day later on.
Hebrews 4-9 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,
Hebrews 4-10 for whoever has entered God's rest has also <f>ⓗ</f>rested from his works as God did from his.
Hebrews 4-11 <pb/>Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so <f>ⓘ</f>that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.
Hebrews 4-12 For <f>ⓙ</f>the word of God is living and <f>ⓚ</f>active, <f>ⓛ</f>sharper than any <f>ⓜ</f>two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and <f>ⓝ</f>discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
Hebrews 4-13 And <f>ⓞ</f>no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are <f>ⓟ</f>naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
Hebrews 4-14 <pb/>Since then we have <f>ⓠ</f>a great high priest <f>ⓡ</f>who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, <f>ⓢ</f>let us hold fast our confession.
Hebrews 4-15 For we do not have a high priest <f>ⓣ</f>who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been <f>ⓤ</f>tempted as we are, <f>ⓥ</f>yet without sin.
Hebrews 4-16 <f>ⓦ</f> Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
