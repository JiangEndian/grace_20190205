Acts 20-19 <f>ⓧ</f> serving the Lord <f>ⓨ</f>with all humility and with <f>ⓩ</f>tears and with trials that happened to me through <f>ⓐ</f>the plots of the Jews;
Acts 20-20 how I <f>ⓑ</f>did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and <f>ⓒ</f>teaching you in public and from house to house,
Acts 20-21 <f>ⓓ</f> testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of <f>ⓔ</f>repentance toward God and of <f>ⓕ</f>faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. <f>[3]</f>

Acts 20-24 But <f>ⓚ</f>I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only <f>ⓛ</f>I may finish my course and <f>ⓜ</f>the ministry <f>ⓝ</f>that I received from the Lord Jesus, <f>ⓞ</f>to testify to <f>ⓟ</f>the gospel of <f>ⓠ</f>the grace of God.
Acts 20-25 And now, behold, <f>ⓡ</f>I know that none of you among whom I have gone about <f>ⓢ</f>proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again.

Acts 20-30 and <f>ⓘ</f>from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.
Acts 20-31 Therefore <f>ⓙ</f>be alert, remembering that <f>ⓚ</f>for three years I did not cease night or day <f>ⓛ</f>to admonish every one <f>ⓜ</f>with tears.
Acts 20-32 And now <f>ⓝ</f>I commend you to God and to <f>ⓞ</f>the word of his grace, which is able to <f>ⓟ</f>build you up and to give you <f>ⓠ</f>the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
Acts 20-33 <f>ⓡ</f> I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.
Acts 20-34 <f>ⓢ</f> You yourselves know that <f>ⓣ</f>these hands ministered to my necessities and <f>ⓤ</f>to those who were with me.
