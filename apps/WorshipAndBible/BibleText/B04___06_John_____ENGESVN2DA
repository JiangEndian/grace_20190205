John 6-1 <pb/>After this <f>ⓐ</f>Jesus went away to the other side of <f>ⓑ</f>the Sea of Galilee, which is <f>ⓒ</f>the Sea of Tiberias.
John 6-2 And a large crowd was following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick.
John 6-3 Jesus went up on <f>ⓓ</f>the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.
John 6-4 Now <f>ⓔ</f>the Passover, the <f>ⓕ</f>feast of the Jews, was at hand.
John 6-5 <f>ⓖ</f> Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to <f>ⓗ</f>Philip, <J>“Where are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?”</J>
John 6-6 He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
John 6-7 <f>ⓘ</f> Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii <f>[1]</f> worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to get a little.”
John 6-8 One of his disciples, <f>ⓙ</f>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,
John 6-9 “There is a boy here who has five <f>ⓚ</f>barley loaves and two fish, but <f>ⓛ</f>what are they for so many?”
John 6-10 Jesus said, <J>“Have the people sit down.”</J> <f>ⓜ</f>Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
John 6-11 Jesus then took the loaves, and <f>ⓝ</f>when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted.
John 6-12 And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, <J>“Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.”</J>
John 6-13 So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.
John 6-14 When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, <f>ⓞ</f>“This is indeed <f>ⓟ</f>the Prophet <f>ⓠ</f>who is to come into the world!”
John 6-15 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus <f>ⓢ</f>withdrew again to <f>ⓣ</f>the mountain by himself.
John 6-16 <pb/>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
John 6-17 got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
John 6-18 The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.
John 6-19 When they had rowed about three or four miles, <f>[2]</f> they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened.
John 6-20 <f>ⓤ</f> But he said to them, <J>“It is I; do not be afraid.”</J>
John 6-21 Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
John 6-22 <pb/>On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only <f>ⓥ</f>one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.
John 6-23 Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord <f>ⓦ</f>had given thanks.
John 6-24 <f>ⓧ</f> So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and <f>ⓨ</f>went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
John 6-25 <pb/>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, <f>ⓩ</f>“Rabbi, when did you come here?”
John 6-26 Jesus answered them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓐ</f>you are seeking me, not because you saw <f>ⓑ</f>signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</J>
John 6-27 <J><f>ⓒ</f> Do not work for the food that perishes, but for <f>ⓓ</f>the food that endures to eternal life, which <f>ⓔ</f>the Son of Man will give to you. For on <f>ⓕ</f>him God the Father has <f>ⓖ</f>set his seal.”</J>
John 6-28 Then they said to him, “What must we do, to be doing <f>ⓗ</f>the works of God?”
John 6-29 Jesus answered them, <J>“This is the work of God, <f>ⓘ</f>that you believe in him whom <f>ⓙ</f>he has sent.”</J>
John 6-30 So they said to him, <f>ⓚ</f>“Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform?
John 6-31 <f>ⓛ</f> Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, <f>ⓜ</f>‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”
John 6-32 Jesus then said to them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</J>
John 6-33 <J>For the bread of God is <f>ⓝ</f>he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</J>
John 6-34 They said to him, <f>ⓞ</f>“Sir, give us this bread always.”
John 6-35 <pb/>Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“I am the bread of life; <f>ⓠ</f>whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.</J>
John 6-36 <J>But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</J>
John 6-37 <J><f>ⓡ</f> All that <f>ⓢ</f>the Father gives me will come to me, and <f>ⓣ</f>whoever comes to me I will never cast out.</J>
John 6-38 <J>For <f>ⓤ</f>I have come down from heaven, not to do <f>ⓥ</f>my own will but <f>ⓦ</f>the will of him <f>ⓧ</f>who sent me.</J>
John 6-39 <J>And <f>ⓨ</f>this is the will of him who sent me, <f>ⓩ</f>that I should lose nothing of <f>ⓐ</f>all that he has given me, but <f>ⓑ</f>raise it up on the last day.</J>
John 6-40 <J>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who <f>ⓒ</f>looks on the Son and <f>ⓓ</f>believes in him <f>ⓔ</f>should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”</J>
John 6-41 <pb/>So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</J>
John 6-42 They said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Is not this Jesus, <f>ⓗ</f>the son of Joseph, whose father and mother <f>ⓘ</f>we know? How does he now say, <J>‘I have come down from heaven’</J>?”
John 6-43 Jesus answered them, <J>“Do not grumble among yourselves.</J>
John 6-44 <J>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me <f>ⓙ</f>draws him. And <f>ⓚ</f>I will raise him up on the last day.</J>
John 6-45 <J>It is written in the Prophets, <f>ⓛ</f>‘And they will all be <f>ⓜ</f>taught by God.’ <f>ⓝ</f>Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me — </J>
John 6-46 <J><f>ⓞ</f> not that anyone has seen the Father except <f>ⓟ</f>he who is from God; he <f>ⓠ</f>has seen the Father.</J>
John 6-47 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓡ</f>whoever believes has eternal life.</J>
John 6-48 <J><f>ⓢ</f> I am the bread of life.</J>
John 6-49 <J><f>ⓣ</f> Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and <f>ⓤ</f>they died.</J>
John 6-50 <J><f>ⓥ</f> This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it <f>ⓦ</f>and not die.</J>
John 6-51 <J>I am the living bread <f>ⓧ</f>that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give <f>ⓨ</f>for the life of the world is <f>ⓩ</f>my flesh.”</J>
John 6-52 <pb/>The Jews then <f>ⓐ</f>disputed among themselves, saying, <f>ⓑ</f>“How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
John 6-53 So Jesus said to them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of <f>ⓒ</f>the Son of Man and drink his blood, you <f>ⓓ</f>have no life in you.</J>
John 6-54 <J>Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood <f>ⓔ</f>has eternal life, and <f>ⓕ</f>I will raise him up on the last day.</J>
John 6-55 <J>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</J>
John 6-56 <J>Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood <f>ⓖ</f>abides in me, and I in him.</J>
John 6-57 <J>As <f>ⓗ</f>the living Father <f>ⓘ</f>sent me, and <f>ⓙ</f>I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me.</J>
John 6-58 <J><f>ⓚ</f> This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread <f>[3]</f> the fathers ate, and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”</J>
John 6-59 Jesus <f>[4]</f> said these things in the synagogue, as he taught <f>ⓛ</f>at Capernaum.
John 6-60 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> When many of his disciples heard it, they said, “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?”
John 6-61 But Jesus, <f>ⓝ</f>knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, <J>“Do you take offense at this?</J>
John 6-62 <J>Then what if you were to see <f>ⓞ</f>the Son of Man <f>ⓟ</f>ascending to <f>ⓠ</f>where he was before?</J>
John 6-63 <J><f>ⓡ</f> It is the Spirit who gives life; <f>ⓢ</f>the flesh is no help at all. <f>ⓣ</f>The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.</J>
John 6-64 <J>But <f>ⓤ</f>there are some of you who do not believe.”</J> (For Jesus <f>ⓥ</f>knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and <f>ⓦ</f>who it was who would betray him.)
John 6-65 And he said, <J>“This is why I told you <f>ⓧ</f>that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”</J>
John 6-66 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him.
John 6-67 So Jesus said to <f>ⓩ</f>the twelve, <J>“Do you want to go away as well?”</J>
John 6-68 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have <f>ⓐ</f>the words of eternal life,
John 6-69 and <f>ⓑ</f>we have believed, and have come to know, that <f>ⓒ</f>you are <f>ⓓ</f>the Holy One of God.”
John 6-70 Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Did I not choose you, <f>ⓕ</f>the twelve? And yet one of you is <f>ⓖ</f>a devil.”</J>
John 6-71 He spoke of Judas <f>ⓗ</f>the son of Simon Iscariot, for <f>ⓘ</f>he, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.
