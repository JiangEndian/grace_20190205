1 Corinthians 10-1 <pb/>For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, <f>[1]</f> that our fathers were all under <f>ⓐ</f>the cloud, and all <f>ⓑ</f>passed through the sea,
1 Corinthians 10-2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
1 Corinthians 10-3 and <f>ⓒ</f>all ate the same <f>ⓓ</f>spiritual food,
1 Corinthians 10-4 and <f>ⓔ</f>all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.
1 Corinthians 10-5 Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for <f>ⓕ</f>they were overthrown <f>[2]</f> in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians 10-6 <pb/>Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as <f>ⓖ</f>they did.
1 Corinthians 10-7 <f>ⓗ</f> Do not be idolaters <f>ⓘ</f>as some of them were; as it is written, <f>ⓙ</f>“The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.”
1 Corinthians 10-8 <f>ⓚ</f> We must not indulge in sexual immorality <f>ⓛ</f>as some of them did, and <f>ⓜ</f>twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
1 Corinthians 10-9 We must not put Christ <f>[3]</f> to the test, <f>ⓝ</f>as some of them did and <f>ⓞ</f>were destroyed by serpents,
1 Corinthians 10-10 nor grumble, <f>ⓟ</f>as some of them did and <f>ⓠ</f>were destroyed by <f>ⓡ</f>the Destroyer.
1 Corinthians 10-11 Now these things happened to them as an example, but <f>ⓢ</f>they were written down for our instruction, <f>ⓣ</f>on whom the end of the ages has come.
1 Corinthians 10-12 Therefore <f>ⓤ</f>let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.
1 Corinthians 10-13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. <f>ⓥ</f>God is faithful, and <f>ⓦ</f>he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
1 Corinthians 10-14 <pb/>Therefore, my beloved, <f>ⓧ</f>flee from idolatry.
1 Corinthians 10-15 I speak <f>ⓨ</f>as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
1 Corinthians 10-16 <f>ⓩ</f> The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? <f>ⓐ</f>The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?
1 Corinthians 10-17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are <f>ⓑ</f>one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
1 Corinthians 10-18 Consider <f>ⓒ</f>the people of Israel: <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
1 Corinthians 10-19 What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that <f>ⓔ</f>an idol is anything?
1 Corinthians 10-20 No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice <f>ⓕ</f>they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons.
1 Corinthians 10-21 <f>ⓖ</f> You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and <f>ⓗ</f>the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and <f>ⓘ</f>the table of demons.
1 Corinthians 10-22 <f>ⓙ</f> Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? <f>ⓚ</f>Are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians 10-23 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up.
1 Corinthians 10-24 <f>ⓜ</f> Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
1 Corinthians 10-25 <f>ⓝ</f> Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
1 Corinthians 10-26 For <f>ⓞ</f>“the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.”
1 Corinthians 10-27 If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, <f>ⓟ</f>eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
1 Corinthians 10-28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience —
1 Corinthians 10-29 I do not mean <f>ⓠ</f>your conscience, but his. For <f>ⓡ</f>why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?
1 Corinthians 10-30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that <f>ⓢ</f>for which I give thanks?
1 Corinthians 10-31 <pb/>So, whether you eat or drink, or <f>ⓣ</f>whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
1 Corinthians 10-32 <f>ⓤ</f> Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to <f>ⓥ</f>the church of God,
1 Corinthians 10-33 just as <f>ⓦ</f>I try to please everyone in everything I do, <f>ⓧ</f>not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
