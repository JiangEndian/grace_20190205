John 11-1 <pb/>Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of <f>ⓐ</f>Mary and her sister Martha.
John 11-2 <f>ⓑ</f> It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.
John 11-3 So the sisters sent to him, saying, “Lord, <f>ⓒ</f>he whom you love is ill.”
John 11-4 But when Jesus heard it he said, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“This illness does not lead to death. It is for <f>ⓔ</f>the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</J>
John 11-5 <pb/>Now <f>ⓕ</f>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
John 11-6 So, when he heard that Lazarus <f>[1]</f> was ill, <f>ⓖ</f>he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.
John 11-7 Then after this he said to the disciples, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“Let us go to Judea again.”</J>
John 11-8 The disciples said to him, <f>ⓘ</f>“Rabbi, <f>ⓙ</f>the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?”
John 11-9 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“Are there not twelve hours in the day? <f>ⓛ</f>If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</J>
John 11-10 <J>But <f>ⓜ</f>if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not <f>ⓝ</f>in him.”</J>
John 11-11 After saying these things, he said to them, <J>“Our friend Lazarus <f>ⓞ</f>has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.”</J>
John 11-12 The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”
John 11-13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.
John 11-14 Then Jesus told them plainly, <J>“Lazarus has died,</J>
John 11-15 <J>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</J>
John 11-16 <f>ⓟ</f> So Thomas, called the Twin, <f>[2]</f> said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, <f>ⓠ</f>that we may die with him.”
John 11-17 <pb/>Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb <f>ⓡ</f>four days.
John 11-18 Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles <f>[3]</f> off,
John 11-19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary <f>ⓢ</f>to console them concerning their brother.
John 11-20 <f>ⓣ</f> So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house.
John 11-21 Martha said to <f>ⓤ</f>Jesus, “Lord, <f>ⓥ</f>if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
John 11-22 But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, <f>ⓦ</f>God will give you.”
John 11-23 Jesus said to her, <J>“Your brother will rise again.”</J>
John 11-24 <f>ⓧ</f> Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in <f>ⓨ</f>the resurrection on the last day.”
John 11-25 Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓩ</f>“I am the resurrection and <f>ⓐ</f>the life. <f>[4]</f> Whoever believes in me, <f>ⓑ</f>though he die, <f>ⓒ</f>yet shall he live,</J>
John 11-26 <J>and everyone who lives and believes in me <f>ⓓ</f>shall never die. Do you believe this?”</J>
John 11-27 She said to him, “Yes, Lord; <f>ⓔ</f>I believe that <f>ⓕ</f>you are the Christ, the Son of God, <f>ⓖ</f>who is coming into the world.”
John 11-28 <pb/>When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, <f>ⓗ</f>“The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”
John 11-29 And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.
John 11-30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.
John 11-31 When the Jews <f>ⓘ</f>who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
John 11-32 Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, <f>ⓙ</f>“Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
John 11-33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he <f>ⓚ</f>was deeply moved <f>[5]</f> in his spirit and <f>ⓛ</f>greatly troubled.
John 11-34 And he said, <J>“Where have you laid him?”</J> They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”
John 11-35 <f>ⓜ</f> Jesus wept.
John 11-36 So the Jews said, “See <f>ⓝ</f>how he loved him!”
John 11-37 But some of them said, “Could not he <f>ⓞ</f>who opened the eyes of the blind man <f>ⓟ</f>also have kept this man from dying?”
John 11-38 <pb/>Then Jesus, <f>ⓠ</f>deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was <f>ⓡ</f>a cave, and <f>ⓢ</f>a stone lay against it.
John 11-39 Jesus said, <J>“Take away the stone.”</J> Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for <f>ⓣ</f>he has been dead four days.”
John 11-40 Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see <f>ⓥ</f>the glory of God?”</J>
John 11-41 So they took away the stone. And Jesus <f>ⓦ</f>lifted up his eyes and said, <J>“Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</J>
John 11-42 <J><f>ⓧ</f> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this <f>ⓨ</f>on account of the people standing around, <f>ⓩ</f>that they may believe that you sent me.”</J>
John 11-43 When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, <J>“Lazarus, come out.”</J>
John 11-44 <f>ⓐ</f> The man who had died came out, <f>ⓑ</f>his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and <f>ⓒ</f>his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <J>“Unbind him, and let him go.”</J>
John 11-45 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Many of the Jews therefore, <f>ⓔ</f>who had come with Mary and <f>ⓕ</f>had seen what he did, believed in him,
John 11-46 but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
John 11-47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees <f>ⓖ</f>gathered <f>ⓗ</f>the council and said, <f>ⓘ</f>“What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.
John 11-48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and <f>ⓙ</f>the Romans will come and take away both our <f>ⓚ</f>place and our nation.”
John 11-49 But one of them, <f>ⓛ</f>Caiaphas, <f>ⓜ</f>who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all.
John 11-50 Nor do you understand that <f>ⓝ</f>it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.”
John 11-51 He did not say this of his own accord, but <f>ⓞ</f>being high priest that year <f>ⓟ</f>he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
John 11-52 and <f>ⓠ</f>not for the nation only, but also <f>ⓡ</f>to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
John 11-53 So from that day on they <f>ⓢ</f>made plans to put him to death.
John 11-54 <pb/>Jesus therefore <f>ⓣ</f>no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.
John 11-55 <pb/>Now <f>ⓤ</f>the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and <f>ⓥ</f>many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover <f>ⓦ</f>to purify themselves.
John 11-56 <f>ⓧ</f> They were looking for <f>[6]</f> Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?”
John 11-57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him.
