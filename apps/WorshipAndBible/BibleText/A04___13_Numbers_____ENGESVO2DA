Numbers 13-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 13-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel. From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them.”
Numbers 13-3 So Moses sent them from <f>ⓑ</f>the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel.
Numbers 13-4 And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
Numbers 13-5 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
Numbers 13-6 <f>ⓒ</f> from the tribe of Judah, <f>ⓓ</f>Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
Numbers 13-7 from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
Numbers 13-8 from the tribe of Ephraim, <f>ⓔ</f>Hoshea the son of Nun;
Numbers 13-9 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
Numbers 13-10 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
Numbers 13-11 from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi;
Numbers 13-12 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
Numbers 13-13 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
Numbers 13-14 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
Numbers 13-15 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
Numbers 13-16 These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called <f>ⓕ</f>Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
Numbers 13-17 <pb/>Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, “Go up into <f>ⓖ</f>the Negeb and go up into <f>ⓗ</f>the hill country,
Numbers 13-18 and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,
Numbers 13-19 and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,
Numbers 13-20 and whether the land is <f>ⓘ</f>rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. <f>ⓙ</f>Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
Numbers 13-21 <pb/>So they went up and spied out the land <f>ⓚ</f>from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, <f>ⓛ</f>near Lebo-hamath.
Numbers 13-22 They went up into <f>ⓜ</f>the Negeb and came to <f>ⓝ</f>Hebron. <f>ⓞ</f>Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the <f>ⓟ</f>descendants of Anak, were there. (<f>ⓠ</f>Hebron was built seven years before <f>ⓡ</f>Zoan in Egypt.)
Numbers 13-23 And <f>ⓢ</f>they came to the Valley of Eshcol and cut down from there a branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole between two of them; they also brought some pomegranates and figs.
Numbers 13-24 That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, <f>[1]</f> because of the cluster that the people of Israel cut down from there.
Numbers 13-25 <pb/>At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.
Numbers 13-26 And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at <f>ⓣ</f>Kadesh. They brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
Numbers 13-27 And they told him, “We came to the land to which you sent us. It <f>ⓤ</f>flows with milk and honey, <f>ⓥ</f>and this is its fruit.
Numbers 13-28 <f>ⓦ</f> However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.
Numbers 13-29 <f>ⓧ</f> The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb. The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country. <f>ⓨ</f>And the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan.”
Numbers 13-30 <pb/>But <f>ⓩ</f>Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it.”
Numbers 13-31 <f>ⓐ</f> Then the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are.”
Numbers 13-32 So <f>ⓑ</f>they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and <f>ⓒ</f>all the people that we saw in it are of great height.
Numbers 13-33 And there we saw the <f>ⓓ</f>Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the <f>ⓔ</f>Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves <f>ⓕ</f>like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.”
