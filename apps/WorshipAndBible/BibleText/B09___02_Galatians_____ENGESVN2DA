Galatians 2-1 <pb/>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.
Galatians 2-2 I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those <f>ⓐ</f>who seemed influential) the gospel that <f>ⓑ</f>I proclaim among the Gentiles, <f>ⓒ</f>in order to make sure I was not running or had not <f>ⓓ</f>run in vain.
Galatians 2-3 But even Titus, who was with me, <f>ⓔ</f>was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.
Galatians 2-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in — who <f>ⓖ</f>slipped in to spy out <f>ⓗ</f>our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, <f>ⓘ</f>so that they might bring us into slavery —
Galatians 2-5 to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that <f>ⓙ</f>the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.
Galatians 2-6 And from those <f>ⓚ</f>who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; <f>ⓛ</f>God shows no partiality) — those, I say, who seemed influential <f>ⓜ</f>added nothing to me.
Galatians 2-7 On the contrary, when they saw that I had been <f>ⓝ</f>entrusted with <f>ⓞ</f>the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised
Galatians 2-8 (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles),
Galatians 2-9 and when James and Cephas and John, <f>ⓟ</f>who seemed to be <f>ⓠ</f>pillars, perceived the <f>ⓡ</f>grace that was given to me, they <f>ⓢ</f>gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
Galatians 2-10 Only, they asked us to remember the poor, <f>ⓣ</f>the very thing I was eager to do.
Galatians 2-11 <pb/>But <f>ⓤ</f>when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him <f>ⓥ</f>to his face, because he stood condemned.
Galatians 2-12 For before certain men came from James, <f>ⓦ</f>he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing <f>ⓧ</f>the circumcision party. <f>[1]</f>
Galatians 2-13 And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
Galatians 2-14 But when I saw that their <f>ⓨ</f>conduct was not in step with <f>ⓩ</f>the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas <f>ⓐ</f>before them all, “If you, though a Jew, <f>ⓑ</f>live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”
Galatians 2-15 <pb/>We ourselves are Jews by birth and not <f>ⓒ</f>Gentile sinners;
Galatians 2-16 yet we know that <f>ⓓ</f>a person is not justified <f>[2]</f> by works of the law <f>ⓔ</f>but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, <f>ⓕ</f>because by works of the law no one will be justified.
Galatians 2-17 <pb/>But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found <f>ⓖ</f>to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!
Galatians 2-18 For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
Galatians 2-19 For through the law I <f>ⓗ</f>died to the law, so that I might <f>ⓘ</f>live to God.
Galatians 2-20 I have been <f>ⓙ</f>crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives <f>ⓚ</f>in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, <f>ⓛ</f>who loved me and <f>ⓜ</f>gave himself for me.
Galatians 2-21 I do not nullify the grace of God, for <f>ⓝ</f>if righteousness <f>[3]</f> were through the law, <f>ⓞ</f>then Christ died for no purpose.
