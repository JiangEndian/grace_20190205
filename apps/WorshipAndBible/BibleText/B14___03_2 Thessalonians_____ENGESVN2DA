2 Thessalonians 3-1 <pb/>Finally, brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>pray for us, that <f>ⓑ</f>the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored, <f>[2]</f> as happened among you,
2 Thessalonians 3-2 and <f>ⓒ</f>that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men. For <f>ⓓ</f>not all have faith.
2 Thessalonians 3-3 But <f>ⓔ</f>the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and <f>ⓕ</f>guard you against <f>ⓖ</f>the evil one. <f>[3]</f>
2 Thessalonians 3-4 And <f>ⓗ</f>we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things that we command.
2 Thessalonians 3-5 May the Lord <f>ⓘ</f>direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.
2 Thessalonians 3-6 <pb/>Now we command you, brothers, <f>ⓙ</f>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, <f>ⓚ</f>that you keep away from any <f>ⓛ</f>brother <f>ⓜ</f>who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us.
2 Thessalonians 3-7 For you yourselves know <f>ⓝ</f>how you ought to imitate us, because <f>ⓞ</f>we were not idle when we were with you,
2 Thessalonians 3-8 nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but <f>ⓟ</f>with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.
2 Thessalonians 3-9 It was <f>ⓠ</f>not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves <f>ⓡ</f>an example to imitate.
2 Thessalonians 3-10 For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: <f>ⓢ</f>If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
2 Thessalonians 3-11 For we hear that some among you <f>ⓣ</f>walk in idleness, not busy at work, but <f>ⓤ</f>busybodies.
2 Thessalonians 3-12 Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. <f>[4]</f>
2 Thessalonians 3-13 <pb/>As for you, brothers, <f>ⓥ</f>do not grow weary in doing good.
2 Thessalonians 3-14 If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and <f>ⓦ</f>have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed.
2 Thessalonians 3-15 <f>ⓧ</f> Do not regard him as an enemy, but <f>ⓨ</f>warn him as a brother.
2 Thessalonians 3-16 <pb/>Now may <f>ⓩ</f>the Lord of peace himself <f>ⓐ</f>give you peace at all times in every way. <f>ⓑ</f>The Lord be with you all.
2 Thessalonians 3-17 <pb/>I, Paul, write <f>ⓒ</f>this greeting with my own hand. This is the sign of genuineness in every letter of mine; it is the way I write.
2 Thessalonians 3-18 <f>ⓓ</f> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
