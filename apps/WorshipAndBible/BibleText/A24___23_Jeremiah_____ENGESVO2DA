Jeremiah 23-3 <f>ⓓ</f> Then I will gather the remnant of my flock <f>ⓔ</f>out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, <f>ⓕ</f>and they shall be fruitful and multiply.

Jeremiah 23-9 <pb/>Concerning the prophets: <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>My heart is broken within me; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>all my bones shake; </t><t>I am like a drunken man, </t><t>like a man overcome by wine, </t><t>because of the LORD </t><t>and because of his holy words.</t>
Jeremiah 23-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> For the land is full of adulterers; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>because of the curse <f>ⓢ</f>the land mourns, </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>Their course is evil, </t><t>and their might is not right.</t>

Jeremiah 23-13 <t>In the prophets of <f>ⓐ</f>Samaria </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>I saw an unsavory thing: </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>they prophesied by Baal </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>and led my people Israel astray.</t>
Jeremiah 23-14 <t>But in the prophets of Jerusalem </t><t>I have seen a horrible thing: </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>they commit adultery and walk in lies; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>they strengthen the hands of evildoers, </t><t>so that no one turns from his evil; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>all of them have become like Sodom to me, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”</t>
Jeremiah 23-15 <t>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>“Behold, I will feed them with bitter food </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>and give them <f>ⓚ</f>poisoned water to drink, </t><t>for from the prophets of Jerusalem </t><t>ungodliness has gone out into all the land.” </t>

Jeremiah 23-17 They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>‘It shall be well with you’; and to everyone who <f>ⓞ</f>stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, <f>ⓟ</f>‘No disaster shall come upon you.’”
Jeremiah 23-18 <pb/><t>For <f>ⓠ</f>who among them has stood in the council of the LORD </t><t>to see and to hear his word, </t><t>or who has paid attention to his word and listened?</t>

Jeremiah 23-25 I have heard what the prophets have said <f>ⓓ</f>who prophesy lies in my name, saying, <f>ⓔ</f>‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’
Jeremiah 23-26 How long shall there be lies in the heart of <f>ⓕ</f>the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,
Jeremiah 23-27 who think to make my people forget my name <f>ⓖ</f>by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their <f>ⓗ</f>fathers forgot my name for Baal?
Jeremiah 23-28 <f>ⓘ</f> Let the prophet who has a dream <f>ⓙ</f>tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. <f>ⓚ</f>What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD.

Jeremiah 23-33 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the LORD?’ you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓡ</f>I will cast you off, declares the LORD.’
Jeremiah 23-34 And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ <f>ⓢ</f>I will punish that man and his household.
Jeremiah 23-35 Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
Jeremiah 23-36 But ‘the burden of the LORD’ you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and <f>ⓣ</f>you pervert the words of <f>ⓤ</f>the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
Jeremiah 23-37 Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
Jeremiah 23-38 But if you say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have said these words, “The burden of the LORD,” when I sent to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’”
