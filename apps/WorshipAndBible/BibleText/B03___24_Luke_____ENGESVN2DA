Luke 24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, <f>ⓑ</f>taking the spices they had prepared.
Luke 24-2 And they found <f>ⓒ</f>the stone rolled away from the tomb,
Luke 24-3 but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke 24-4 While they were perplexed about this, behold, <f>ⓓ</f>two <f>ⓔ</f>men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
Luke 24-5 And as they were <f>ⓕ</f>frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
Luke 24-6 He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, <f>ⓖ</f>while he was still in Galilee,
Luke 24-7 <f>ⓗ</f> that the Son of Man <f>ⓘ</f>must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and <f>ⓙ</f>be crucified and on <f>ⓚ</f>the third day rise.”
Luke 24-8 And <f>ⓛ</f>they remembered his words,
Luke 24-9 and returning from the tomb they <f>ⓜ</f>told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
Luke 24-10 Now it was <f>ⓝ</f>Mary Magdalene and <f>ⓞ</f>Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles,
Luke 24-11 but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and <f>ⓟ</f>they did not believe them.
Luke 24-12 But <f>ⓠ</f>Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw <f>ⓡ</f>the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.
Luke 24-13 <pb/>That very day <f>ⓢ</f>two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles <f>[1]</f> from Jerusalem,
Luke 24-14 and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
Luke 24-15 While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.
Luke 24-16 <f>ⓣ</f> But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
Luke 24-17 And he said to them, <J>“What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?”</J> And they stood still, looking sad.
Luke 24-18 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”
Luke 24-19 And he said to them, <J>“What things?”</J> And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was <f>ⓤ</f>a prophet <f>ⓥ</f>mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
Luke 24-20 and <f>ⓦ</f>how our chief priests and <f>ⓧ</f>rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
Luke 24-21 But we had hoped that he was <f>ⓨ</f>the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now <f>ⓩ</f>the third day since these things happened.
Luke 24-22 Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. <f>ⓐ</f>They were at the tomb early in the morning,
Luke 24-23 and <f>ⓑ</f>when they did not find his body, they came back saying that <f>ⓒ</f>they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
Luke 24-24 <f>ⓓ</f> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.”
Luke 24-25 And he said to them, <J>“O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</J>
Luke 24-26 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Was it not necessary that <f>ⓕ</f>the Christ should suffer these things and enter into <f>ⓖ</f>his glory?”</J>
Luke 24-27 And <f>ⓗ</f>beginning with <f>ⓘ</f>Moses and <f>ⓙ</f>all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
Luke 24-28 <pb/>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. <f>ⓚ</f>He acted as if he were going farther,
Luke 24-29 but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and <f>ⓛ</f>the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them.
Luke 24-30 When he was at table with them, he took the bread and <f>ⓜ</f>blessed and broke it and gave it to them.
Luke 24-31 <f>ⓝ</f> And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And <f>ⓞ</f>he vanished from their sight.
Luke 24-32 They said to each other, <f>ⓟ</f>“Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he <f>ⓠ</f>opened to us the Scriptures?”
Luke 24-33 And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they <f>ⓡ</f>found the eleven and <f>ⓢ</f>those who were with them gathered together,
Luke 24-34 saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and <f>ⓣ</f>has appeared to Simon!”
Luke 24-35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and <f>ⓤ</f>how he was known to them in <f>ⓥ</f>the breaking of the bread.
Luke 24-36 <pb/>As they were talking about these things, <f>ⓦ</f>Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <J>“Peace to you!”</J>
Luke 24-37 But they were <f>ⓧ</f>startled and <f>ⓨ</f>frightened and <f>ⓩ</f>thought they saw a spirit.
Luke 24-38 And he said to them, <J>“Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</J>
Luke 24-39 <J>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. <f>ⓐ</f>Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”</J>
Luke 24-40 And when he had said this, <f>ⓑ</f>he showed them his hands and his feet.
Luke 24-41 And while they still disbelieved <f>ⓒ</f>for joy and were marveling, <f>ⓓ</f>he said to them, <J>“Have you anything here to eat?”</J>
Luke 24-42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <f>[2]</f>
Luke 24-43 and he took it and ate before them.
Luke 24-44 <pb/>Then he said to them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, <f>ⓕ</f>that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”</J>
Luke 24-45 Then <f>ⓖ</f>he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
Luke 24-46 and said to them, <J>“Thus <f>ⓗ</f>it is written, <f>ⓘ</f>that the Christ should suffer and on the third day <f>ⓙ</f>rise from the dead,</J>
Luke 24-47 <J>and that <f>ⓚ</f>repentance for <f>[3]</f> the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed <f>ⓛ</f>in his name <f>ⓜ</f>to all nations, <f>ⓝ</f>beginning from Jerusalem.</J>
Luke 24-48 <J><f>ⓞ</f> You are witnesses of these things.</J>
Luke 24-49 <J>And behold, I am sending <f>ⓟ</f>the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you <f>ⓠ</f>are clothed with <f>ⓡ</f>power <f>ⓢ</f>from on high.”</J>
Luke 24-50 <pb/>And <f>ⓣ</f>he led them out as far as <f>ⓤ</f>Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.
Luke 24-51 While he blessed them, <f>ⓥ</f>he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.
Luke 24-52 And they <f>ⓦ</f>worshiped him and <f>ⓧ</f>returned to Jerusalem <f>ⓨ</f>with great joy,
Luke 24-53 and <f>ⓩ</f>were continually in the temple <f>ⓐ</f>blessing God.
