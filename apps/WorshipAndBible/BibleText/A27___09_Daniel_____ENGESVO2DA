Daniel 9-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the first year of <f>ⓑ</f>Darius the son of Ahasuerus, by descent a <f>ⓒ</f>Mede, who was made king over the realm of the <f>ⓓ</f>Chaldeans —
Daniel 9-2 in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years that, according to <f>ⓔ</f>the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.
Daniel 9-3 <pb/>Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by <f>ⓕ</f>prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
Daniel 9-4 I prayed to the LORD my God and <f>ⓖ</f>made confession, saying, <f>ⓗ</f>“O Lord, the <f>ⓘ</f>great and awesome God, who <f>ⓙ</f>keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments,
Daniel 9-5 <f>ⓚ</f> we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly <f>ⓛ</f>and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and rules.
Daniel 9-6 <f>ⓜ</f> We have not listened to <f>ⓝ</f>your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to <f>ⓞ</f>our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
Daniel 9-7 To you, <f>ⓟ</f>O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, <f>ⓠ</f>those who are near and <f>ⓡ</f>those who are far away, in <f>ⓢ</f>all the lands to which you have driven them, because of <f>ⓣ</f>the treachery that they have committed against you.
Daniel 9-8 To us, O LORD, belongs open shame, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because <f>ⓤ</f>we have sinned against you.
Daniel 9-9 <f>ⓥ</f> To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against him
Daniel 9-10 <f>ⓦ</f> and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God by walking in his laws, which he set before us by <f>ⓧ</f>his servants the prophets.
Daniel 9-11 <f>ⓨ</f> All Israel has transgressed your law and turned aside, <f>ⓩ</f>refusing to obey your voice. <f>ⓐ</f>And the curse and oath <f>ⓑ</f>that are written in the Law of <f>ⓒ</f>Moses the servant of God have been poured out upon us, because <f>ⓓ</f>we have sinned against him.
Daniel 9-12 He has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us and against <f>ⓔ</f>our rulers who ruled us, <f>[1]</f> by <f>ⓕ</f>bringing upon us a great calamity. <f>ⓖ</f>For under the whole heaven there has not been done anything like what has been done against Jerusalem.
Daniel 9-13 <f>ⓗ</f> As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has come upon us; yet we have not entreated the favor of the LORD our God, <f>ⓘ</f>turning from our iniquities and gaining insight by your truth.
Daniel 9-14 <f>ⓙ</f> Therefore the LORD has kept ready the calamity and has brought it upon us, <f>ⓚ</f>for the LORD our God is righteous in all the works that he has done, and <f>ⓛ</f>we have not obeyed his voice.
Daniel 9-15 And now, O Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt <f>ⓜ</f>with a mighty hand, and <f>ⓝ</f>have made a name for yourself, as at this day, <f>ⓞ</f>we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
Daniel 9-16 <pb/>“O Lord, <f>ⓟ</f>according to all your righteous acts, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, <f>ⓠ</f>your holy hill, <f>ⓡ</f>because for our sins, and for <f>ⓢ</f>the iniquities of our fathers, <f>ⓣ</f>Jerusalem and your people have become <f>ⓤ</f>a byword among all who are around us.
Daniel 9-17 Now therefore, O our God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his pleas for mercy, and for your own sake, O Lord, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>make your face to shine upon <f>ⓦ</f>your sanctuary, which is desolate.
Daniel 9-18 <f>ⓧ</f> O my God, incline your ear and hear. Open your eyes and see <f>ⓨ</f>our desolations, and <f>ⓩ</f>the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy.
Daniel 9-19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. <f>ⓐ</f>Delay not, <f>ⓑ</f>for your own sake, O my God, because <f>ⓒ</f>your city and <f>ⓓ</f>your people are called by your name.”
Daniel 9-20 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the LORD my God for <f>ⓕ</f>the holy hill of my God,
Daniel 9-21 while I was speaking in prayer, the man <f>ⓖ</f>Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, <f>ⓗ</f>came to me in swift flight at <f>ⓘ</f>the time of the evening sacrifice.
Daniel 9-22 <f>ⓙ</f> He made me understand, speaking with me and saying, “O Daniel, I have now come out to give you <f>ⓚ</f>insight and understanding.
Daniel 9-23 <f>ⓛ</f> At the beginning of your pleas for mercy a word went out, <f>ⓜ</f>and I have come to tell it to you, for <f>ⓝ</f>you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the word <f>ⓞ</f>and understand the vision.
Daniel 9-24 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> “Seventy weeks <f>[3]</f> are decreed about your people and <f>ⓠ</f>your holy city, to finish <f>ⓡ</f>the transgression, to put an end to sin, <f>ⓢ</f>and to atone for iniquity, <f>ⓣ</f>to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and <f>ⓤ</f>to anoint a most holy place. <f>[4]</f>
Daniel 9-25 <f>ⓥ</f> Know therefore and understand that <f>ⓦ</f>from the going out of the word to restore and <f>ⓧ</f>build Jerusalem to the coming of an <f>ⓨ</f>anointed one, a <f>ⓩ</f>prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again <f>[5]</f> with squares and moat, <f>ⓐ</f>but in a troubled time.
Daniel 9-26 And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall <f>ⓑ</f>be cut off and shall have nothing. And the people of the prince who is to come <f>ⓒ</f>shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. <f>ⓓ</f>Its <f>[6]</f> end shall come with a flood, <f>ⓔ</f>and to the end there shall be war. <f>ⓕ</f>Desolations are decreed.
Daniel 9-27 And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, <f>[7]</f> and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. <f>ⓖ</f>And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until <f>ⓗ</f>the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.”
