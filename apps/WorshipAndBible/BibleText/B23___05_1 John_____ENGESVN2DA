1 John 5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Everyone who believes that <f>ⓑ</f>Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and <f>ⓒ</f>everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
1 John 5-2 <f>ⓓ</f> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.
1 John 5-3 For <f>ⓔ</f>this is the love of God, that we <f>ⓕ</f>keep his commandments. And <f>ⓖ</f>his commandments are not burdensome.
1 John 5-4 For <f>ⓗ</f>everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world — <f>ⓘ</f>our faith.
1 John 5-5 Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes <f>ⓙ</f>that Jesus is the Son of God?
1 John 5-6 <pb/>This is he who came <f>ⓚ</f>by water and blood — Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And <f>ⓛ</f>the Spirit is the one who testifies, because <f>ⓜ</f>the Spirit is the truth.
1 John 5-7 For there are three that testify:
1 John 5-8 the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.
1 John 5-9 <f>ⓝ</f> If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God <f>ⓞ</f>that he has borne concerning his Son.
1 John 5-10 Whoever believes in the Son of God <f>ⓟ</f>has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God <f>ⓠ</f>has made him a liar, <f>ⓡ</f>because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.
1 John 5-11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us <f>ⓢ</f>eternal life, and <f>ⓣ</f>this life is in his Son.
1 John 5-12 <f>ⓤ</f> Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
1 John 5-13 <pb/>I write <f>ⓥ</f>these things to you who <f>ⓦ</f>believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.
1 John 5-14 And this is <f>ⓧ</f>the confidence that we have toward him, that <f>ⓨ</f>if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.
1 John 5-15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.
1 John 5-16 <pb/>If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and <f>ⓩ</f>God <f>[1]</f> will give him life — to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. <f>ⓐ</f>There is sin that leads to death; <f>ⓑ</f>I do not say that one should pray for that.
1 John 5-17 <f>ⓒ</f> All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
1 John 5-18 <pb/>We know that <f>ⓓ</f>everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but <f>ⓔ</f>he who was born of God <f>ⓕ</f>protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
1 John 5-19 <pb/>We know that we are from God, and <f>ⓖ</f>the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
1 John 5-20 <pb/>And we know that the Son of God has come and <f>ⓗ</f>has given us understanding, so that we may know <f>ⓘ</f>him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and <f>ⓙ</f>eternal life.
1 John 5-21 Little children, <f>ⓚ</f>keep yourselves from idols.
