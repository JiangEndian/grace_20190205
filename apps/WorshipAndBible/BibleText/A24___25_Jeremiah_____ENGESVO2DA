Jeremiah 25-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
Jeremiah 25-2 which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
Jeremiah 25-3 “For twenty-three years, <f>ⓑ</f>from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken <f>ⓒ</f>persistently to you, <f>ⓓ</f>but you have not listened.
Jeremiah 25-4 <f>ⓔ</f> You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the LORD <f>ⓕ</f>persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets,
Jeremiah 25-5 saying, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Turn now, every one of you, <f>ⓗ</f>from his evil way and evil deeds, and <f>ⓘ</f>dwell upon the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers from of old and forever.
Jeremiah 25-6 <f>ⓙ</f> Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, <f>ⓚ</f>or provoke me to anger <f>ⓛ</f>with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’
Jeremiah 25-7 <f>ⓜ</f> Yet you have not listened to me, declares the LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>that you might provoke me to anger <f>ⓞ</f>with the work of your hands to your own harm.
Jeremiah 25-8 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words,
Jeremiah 25-9 <f>ⓟ</f> behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, declares the LORD, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, <f>ⓠ</f>my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction, <f>ⓡ</f>and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation.
Jeremiah 25-10 Moreover, <f>ⓢ</f>I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, <f>ⓣ</f>the grinding of the millstones and <f>ⓤ</f>the light of the lamp.
Jeremiah 25-11 <f>ⓥ</f> This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and <f>ⓦ</f>these nations shall serve the king of Babylon <f>ⓧ</f>seventy years.
Jeremiah 25-12 Then after <f>ⓨ</f>seventy years are completed, <f>ⓩ</f>I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, <f>ⓐ</f>the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>making the land an everlasting waste.
Jeremiah 25-13 I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written <f>ⓒ</f>in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
Jeremiah 25-14 <f>ⓓ</f> For many nations <f>ⓔ</f>and great kings shall make slaves even of them, <f>ⓕ</f>and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”
Jeremiah 25-15 <pb/>Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: <f>ⓖ</f>“Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
Jeremiah 25-16 They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of <f>ⓗ</f>the sword that I am sending among them.”
Jeremiah 25-17 <pb/>So I took the cup from the LORD's hand, <f>ⓘ</f>and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it:
Jeremiah 25-18 <f>ⓙ</f> Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials, <f>ⓚ</f>to make them a desolation and a waste, a hissing and a curse, as at this day;
Jeremiah 25-19 <f>ⓛ</f> Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, all his people,
Jeremiah 25-20 and <f>ⓜ</f>all the mixed tribes among them; all the kings of <f>ⓝ</f>the land of Uz and all the kings of <f>ⓞ</f>the land of the Philistines (<f>ⓟ</f>Ashkelon, <f>ⓠ</f>Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of <f>ⓡ</f>Ashdod);
Jeremiah 25-21 <f>ⓢ</f> Edom, <f>ⓣ</f>Moab, and the sons of <f>ⓤ</f>Ammon;
Jeremiah 25-22 all the kings of <f>ⓥ</f>Tyre, all the kings of <f>ⓦ</f>Sidon, and the kings of the coastland across <f>ⓧ</f>the sea;
Jeremiah 25-23 <f>ⓨ</f> Dedan, <f>ⓩ</f>Tema, <f>ⓐ</f>Buz, and all who cut <f>ⓑ</f>the corners of their hair;
Jeremiah 25-24 all the <f>ⓒ</f>kings of Arabia and all the kings of <f>ⓓ</f>the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert;
Jeremiah 25-25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of <f>ⓔ</f>Elam, and all the kings of <f>ⓕ</f>Media;
Jeremiah 25-26 all the kings of <f>ⓖ</f>the north, far and near, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of <f>ⓗ</f>Babylon <f>[1]</f> shall drink.
Jeremiah 25-27 <pb/>“Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓘ</f>Drink, be drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more, because of <f>ⓙ</f>the sword that I am sending among you.’
Jeremiah 25-28 <pb/>“And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓚ</f>You must drink!
Jeremiah 25-29 For behold, <f>ⓛ</f>I begin to work disaster at the city that is called by my name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, <f>ⓜ</f>for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of hosts.’
Jeremiah 25-30 <pb/>“You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“‘The LORD will roar from on high, </t><t>and from his holy habitation utter his voice; </t><t>he will roar mightily against his fold, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and shout, like those who tread grapes, </t><t>against all the inhabitants of the earth.</t>
Jeremiah 25-31 <t>The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, </t><t>for <f>ⓟ</f>the LORD has an indictment against the nations; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>he is entering into judgment with all flesh, </t><t>and the wicked he will put to the sword, <pb/>declares the LORD.’ </t>
Jeremiah 25-32 <pb/><t>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: </t><t>Behold, disaster is going forth </t><t>from nation to nation, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>and a great tempest is stirring </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>from the farthest parts of the earth! </t>
Jeremiah 25-33 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> “And those pierced by the LORD on that day shall extend from one end of the earth to the other. <f>ⓤ</f>They shall not be lamented, <f>ⓥ</f>or gathered, or buried; <f>ⓦ</f>they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.
Jeremiah 25-34 <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f> “Wail, <f>ⓨ</f>you shepherds, and cry out, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>and roll in ashes, you lords of the flock, </t><t>for the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come, </t><t>and you shall fall like a choice vessel.</t>
Jeremiah 25-35 <t>No refuge will remain <f>ⓐ</f>for the shepherds, </t><t>nor escape for the lords of the flock.</t>
Jeremiah 25-36 <t>A voice — the cry <f>ⓑ</f>of the shepherds, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and the wail of the lords of the flock! </t><t>For the LORD is laying waste their pasture,</t>
Jeremiah 25-37 <t><f>ⓓ</f> and the peaceful folds are devastated </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 25-38 <t>Like a lion <f>ⓕ</f>he has left his lair, </t><t>for their land has become a waste </t><t>because of <f>ⓖ</f>the sword of the oppressor, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and because of his fierce anger.” </t>
