Ezekiel 43-1 <pb/>Then he led me to <f>ⓐ</f>the gate, the gate facing east.
Ezekiel 43-2 And behold, <f>ⓑ</f>the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And <f>ⓒ</f>the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and <f>ⓓ</f>the earth shone with his glory.
Ezekiel 43-3 And <f>ⓔ</f>the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen <f>ⓕ</f>when he <f>[1]</f> came to destroy the city, and just like <f>ⓖ</f>the vision that I had seen <f>ⓗ</f>by the Chebar canal. And <f>ⓘ</f>I fell on my face.
Ezekiel 43-4 As <f>ⓙ</f>the glory of the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>entered the temple by the gate facing east,
Ezekiel 43-5 <f>ⓛ</f> the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into <f>ⓜ</f>the inner court; and behold, <f>ⓝ</f>the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
Ezekiel 43-6 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> While the man was standing beside me, <f>ⓟ</f>I heard one speaking to me out of the temple,
Ezekiel 43-7 and he said to me, <f>ⓠ</f>“Son of man, this is <f>ⓡ</f>the place of my throne and <f>ⓢ</f>the place of the soles of my feet, <f>ⓣ</f>where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more <f>ⓤ</f>defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoring and by the dead bodies <f>[2]</f> of their kings at their high places, <f>[3]</f>
Ezekiel 43-8 by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with <f>ⓥ</f>only a wall between me and them. They have <f>ⓦ</f>defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger.
Ezekiel 43-9 Now let them put away their whoring and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, <f>ⓧ</f>and I will dwell in their midst forever.
Ezekiel 43-10 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓨ</f>son of man, <f>ⓩ</f>describe to the house of Israel the temple, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the plan.
Ezekiel 43-11 And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, <f>ⓐ</f>make known to them the design of the temple, its arrangement, <f>ⓑ</f>its exits and its entrances, that is, its whole design; and make known to them as well all its statutes and its whole design and all its laws, and write it down <f>ⓒ</f>in their sight, so that they may observe all its laws and all its statutes and carry them out.
Ezekiel 43-12 This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of <f>ⓓ</f>the mountain <f>ⓔ</f>all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.
Ezekiel 43-13 <pb/>“These are the measurements of <f>ⓕ</f>the altar by cubits (the cubit being <f>ⓖ</f>a cubit and a handbreadth): <f>[4]</f> its base shall be one cubit high <f>[5]</f> and one cubit broad, with a rim of one span <f>[6]</f> around its edge. And this shall be the height of the altar:
Ezekiel 43-14 from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit;
Ezekiel 43-15 and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, <f>ⓗ</f>four horns.
Ezekiel 43-16 The altar hearth shall be <f>ⓘ</f>square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad.
Ezekiel 43-17 The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit all around. <f>ⓙ</f>The steps of the altar shall face east.”
Ezekiel 43-18 <pb/>And he said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon it and <f>ⓛ</f>for throwing blood against it,
Ezekiel 43-19 you shall give to <f>ⓜ</f>the Levitical priests <f>ⓝ</f>of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓞ</f>a bull from the herd for a sin offering.
Ezekiel 43-20 And <f>ⓟ</f>you shall take some of its blood and put it on <f>ⓠ</f>the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the ledge and upon <f>ⓡ</f>the rim all around. <f>ⓢ</f>Thus you shall purify the altar and make atonement for it.
Ezekiel 43-21 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and <f>ⓣ</f>it shall be burned in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area.
Ezekiel 43-22 And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be purified, as it was purified with the bull.
Ezekiel 43-23 When you have finished <f>ⓤ</f>purifying it, you shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish and <f>ⓥ</f>a ram from the flock without blemish.
Ezekiel 43-24 You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests <f>ⓦ</f>shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.
Ezekiel 43-25 <f>ⓧ</f> For seven days you shall provide daily a male goat for a sin offering; also, a bull from the herd and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided.
Ezekiel 43-26 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and so consecrate it. <f>[7]</f>
Ezekiel 43-27 And when they have completed these days, then <f>ⓨ</f>from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer on the altar your burnt offerings and your <f>ⓩ</f>peace offerings, and <f>ⓐ</f>I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD.”
