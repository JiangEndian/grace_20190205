James 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
James 3-2 For <f>ⓑ</f>we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, <f>ⓒ</f>he is a perfect man, <f>ⓓ</f>able also to bridle his whole body.
James 3-3 If we put <f>ⓔ</f>bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.
James 3-4 Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
James 3-5 So also the tongue is a small member, yet <f>ⓕ</f>it boasts of great things. <pb/>How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
James 3-6 And <f>ⓖ</f>the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, <f>ⓗ</f>staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, <f>[1]</f> and set on fire by hell. <f>[2]</f>
James 3-7 For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
James 3-8 but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, <f>ⓘ</f>full of deadly poison.
James 3-9 With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people <f>ⓙ</f>who are made in the likeness of God.
James 3-10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, <f>[3]</f> these things ought not to be so.
James 3-11 Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water?
James 3-12 Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.
James 3-13 <pb/>Who is wise and understanding among you? <f>ⓚ</f>By his good conduct let him show his works <f>ⓛ</f>in the meekness of wisdom.
James 3-14 But if you have bitter <f>ⓜ</f>jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
James 3-15 This is not <f>ⓝ</f>the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, <f>ⓞ</f>demonic.
James 3-16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.
James 3-17 But <f>ⓟ</f>the wisdom from above is first pure, then <f>ⓠ</f>peaceable, gentle, open to reason, <f>ⓡ</f>full of mercy and good fruits, <f>ⓢ</f>impartial and <f>ⓣ</f>sincere.
James 3-18 And <f>ⓤ</f>a harvest of righteousness <f>ⓥ</f>is sown in peace by those who make peace.
