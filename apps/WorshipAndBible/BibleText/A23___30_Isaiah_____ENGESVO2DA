Isaiah 30-1 <pb/><t>“Ah, <f>ⓐ</f>stubborn children,” declares the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>“who carry out a plan, but not mine, </t><t>and who make <f>ⓒ</f>an alliance, <f>[1]</f> but not of my Spirit, </t><t>that they may add sin to sin;</t>
Isaiah 30-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> who set out to go down to Egypt, </t><t>without asking for my direction, </t><t>to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh </t><t>and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!</t>
Isaiah 30-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame, </t><t>and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation.</t>
Isaiah 30-4 <t>For though his officials are at <f>ⓕ</f>Zoan </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>his envoys reach <f>ⓗ</f>Hanes,</t>
Isaiah 30-5 <t>everyone comes to shame </t><t>through <f>ⓘ</f>a people that cannot profit them, </t><t>that brings neither help nor profit, </t><t>but shame and disgrace.” </t>
Isaiah 30-6 <pb/>An <f>ⓙ</f>oracle on <f>ⓚ</f>the beasts of <f>ⓛ</f>the Negeb. <pb/><t>Through a land of trouble and anguish, </t><t>from where come the lioness and the lion, </t><t>the adder and the <f>ⓜ</f>flying fiery serpent, </t><t>they carry their riches on the backs of donkeys, </t><t>and their treasures on the humps of camels, </t><t>to a people that cannot profit them.</t>
Isaiah 30-7 <t>Egypt's <f>ⓝ</f>help is worthless and empty; </t><t>therefore I have called her </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>“Rahab who sits still.” </t>
Isaiah 30-8 <pb/><t>And now, go, <f>ⓟ</f>write it before them on a tablet </t><t>and inscribe it in a book, </t><t>that it may be for the time to come </t><t>as a witness forever. <f>[2]</f></t>
Isaiah 30-9 <t><f>ⓠ</f> For they are a rebellious people, </t><t>lying children, </t><t>children unwilling to hear </t><t>the instruction of the LORD;</t>
Isaiah 30-10 <t><f>ⓡ</f> who say to <f>ⓢ</f>the seers, “Do not see,” </t><t>and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us what is right; </t><t>speak to us <f>ⓣ</f>smooth things, </t><t>prophesy illusions,</t>
Isaiah 30-11 <t>leave the way, turn aside from the path, </t><t>let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel.”</t>
Isaiah 30-12 <t>Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, </t><t>“Because you despise this word </t><t>and trust in <f>ⓤ</f>oppression and perverseness </t><t>and rely on them,</t>
Isaiah 30-13 <t>therefore this iniquity shall be to you </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>like a breach in a high wall, bulging out and about to collapse, </t><t>whose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant;</t>
Isaiah 30-14 <t>and its breaking is <f>ⓦ</f>like that of a potter's vessel </t><t>that is smashed so ruthlessly </t><t>that among its fragments not a shard is found </t><t>with which to take fire from the hearth, </t><t>or to dip up water out of the cistern.” </t>
Isaiah 30-15 <pb/><t>For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, </t><t>“In <f>ⓧ</f>returning <f>[3]</f> and <f>ⓨ</f>rest you shall be saved; </t><t>in quietness and in trust shall be your strength.” </t><t>But you were unwilling, </t>
Isaiah 30-16 <t>and you said, </t><t>“No! We will flee upon <f>ⓩ</f>horses”; </t><t>therefore you shall flee away; </t><t>and, “We will ride upon swift steeds”; </t><t>therefore your pursuers shall be swift.</t>
Isaiah 30-17 <t><f>ⓐ</f> A thousand shall flee at the threat of one; </t><t>at the threat of five you shall flee, </t><t>till you are left </t><t>like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, </t><t>like a signal on a hill. </t>
Isaiah 30-18 <pb/><t>Therefore the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>waits to be gracious to you, </t><t>and therefore he <f>ⓒ</f>exalts himself to show mercy to you. </t><t>For the LORD is a God of justice; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>blessed are all those who wait for him. </t>
Isaiah 30-19 <pb/>For a people shall dwell <f>ⓔ</f>in Zion, in Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. As soon as he hears it, he answers you.
Isaiah 30-20 And though the Lord give you the <f>ⓕ</f>bread of adversity and the <f>ⓖ</f>water of affliction, <f>ⓗ</f>yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore, but your eyes shall see your Teacher.
Isaiah 30-21 <f>ⓘ</f> And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is <f>ⓙ</f>the way, walk in it,” when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.
Isaiah 30-22 Then you will defile your carved idols overlaid with silver and your gold-plated metal images. <f>ⓚ</f>You will scatter them as unclean things. You will say to them, “Be gone!”
Isaiah 30-23 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And he will give <f>ⓜ</f>rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and bread, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. <f>ⓝ</f>In that day your livestock will graze in large pastures,
Isaiah 30-24 and <f>ⓞ</f>the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork.
Isaiah 30-25 And <f>ⓟ</f>on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water, in the day of the great slaughter, <f>ⓠ</f>when the towers fall.
Isaiah 30-26 <f>ⓡ</f> Moreover, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when <f>ⓢ</f>the LORD binds up <f>ⓣ</f>the brokenness of his people, and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.
Isaiah 30-27 <pb/><t>Behold, the name of the LORD comes from afar, </t><t>burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke; <f>[4]</f> </t><t>his lips are full of fury, </t><t>and his tongue is like a devouring fire;</t>
Isaiah 30-28 <t><f>ⓤ</f> his breath is <f>ⓥ</f>like an overflowing stream </t><t>that reaches up to the neck; </t><t>to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction, </t><t>and to place on the jaws of the peoples <f>ⓦ</f>a bridle that leads astray. </t>
Isaiah 30-29 <pb/>You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, <f>ⓧ</f>as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to <f>ⓨ</f>the mountain of the LORD, to <f>ⓩ</f>the Rock of Israel.
Isaiah 30-30 And the LORD <f>ⓐ</f>will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger <f>ⓑ</f>and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst <f>ⓒ</f>and storm and hailstones.
Isaiah 30-31 The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the LORD, <f>ⓓ</f>when he strikes with his rod.
Isaiah 30-32 And every stroke of the appointed staff that the LORD lays on them <f>ⓔ</f>will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres. <f>ⓕ</f>Battling with brandished arm, he will fight with them.
Isaiah 30-33 For <f>ⓖ</f>a burning place <f>[5]</f> has long been prepared; indeed, for the king it is made ready, <f>ⓗ</f>its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; <f>ⓘ</f>the breath of the LORD, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
