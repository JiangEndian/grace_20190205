Ezekiel 38-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 38-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>set your face toward <f>ⓒ</f>Gog, of the land of <f>ⓓ</f>Magog, the <f>ⓔ</f>chief prince of <f>ⓕ</f>Meshech <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>Tubal, and <f>ⓗ</f>prophesy against him
Ezekiel 38-3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech <f>[2]</f> and Tubal.
Ezekiel 38-4 <f>ⓙ</f> And I will turn you about and <f>ⓚ</f>put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and <f>ⓛ</f>all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great host, all of them with buckler and shield, wielding swords.
Ezekiel 38-5 <f>ⓜ</f> Persia, <f>ⓝ</f>Cush, and <f>ⓞ</f>Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
Ezekiel 38-6 <f>ⓟ</f> Gomer and all his <f>ⓠ</f>hordes; <f>ⓡ</f>Beth-togarmah from <f>ⓢ</f>the uttermost parts of the north with all his hordes — <f>ⓣ</f>many peoples are with you.
Ezekiel 38-7 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> “Be ready and keep ready, you and all your hosts that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them.
Ezekiel 38-8 <f>ⓥ</f> After many days you will be mustered. <f>ⓦ</f>In the latter years you will go against <f>ⓧ</f>the land that is restored from war, the land whose people <f>ⓨ</f>were gathered from many peoples upon <f>ⓩ</f>the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. Its people were brought out from the peoples and <f>ⓐ</f>now dwell securely, all of them.
Ezekiel 38-9 You will advance, coming on <f>ⓑ</f>like a storm. You will be <f>ⓒ</f>like a cloud covering the land, you and all your <f>ⓓ</f>hordes, and many peoples with you.
Ezekiel 38-10 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day, <f>ⓔ</f>thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme
Ezekiel 38-11 and say, ‘I will go up against <f>ⓕ</f>the land of unwalled villages. I will fall upon <f>ⓖ</f>the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates,’
Ezekiel 38-12 to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against <f>ⓗ</f>the waste places that are now inhabited, and <f>ⓘ</f>the people who were gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, <f>ⓙ</f>who dwell at the center of the earth.
Ezekiel 38-13 <f>ⓚ</f> Sheba and <f>ⓛ</f>Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all <f>ⓜ</f>its leaders <f>[3]</f> will say to you, ‘Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to seize great spoil?’
Ezekiel 38-14 <pb/>“Therefore, <f>ⓝ</f>son of man, prophesy, and say to <f>ⓞ</f>Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day when my people Israel are <f>ⓟ</f>dwelling securely, <f>ⓠ</f>will you not know it?
Ezekiel 38-15 You will come from your place out of <f>ⓡ</f>the uttermost parts of the north, you and <f>ⓢ</f>many peoples with you, <f>ⓣ</f>all of them riding on horses, a great host, a mighty army.
Ezekiel 38-16 You will come up against my people Israel, <f>ⓤ</f>like a cloud covering the land. <f>ⓥ</f>In the latter days I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when through you, O Gog, <f>ⓦ</f>I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.
Ezekiel 38-17 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you <f>ⓧ</f>he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who in those days prophesied for years that I would bring you against them?
Ezekiel 38-18 But on that day, the day that Gog shall come against the land of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓨ</f>my wrath will be roused in my anger.
Ezekiel 38-19 For <f>ⓩ</f>in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare, On that day <f>ⓐ</f>there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
Ezekiel 38-20 <f>ⓑ</f> The fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the people who are on the face of the earth, <f>ⓒ</f>shall quake at my presence. And <f>ⓓ</f>the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground.
Ezekiel 38-21 <f>ⓔ</f> I will summon a sword against Gog <f>[4]</f> on all my mountains, declares the Lord GOD. <f>ⓕ</f>Every man's sword will be against his brother.
Ezekiel 38-22 With pestilence and bloodshed <f>ⓖ</f>I will enter into judgment with him, and <f>ⓗ</f>I will rain upon him and <f>ⓘ</f>his hordes and the many peoples who are with him <f>ⓙ</f>torrential rains and hailstones, <f>ⓚ</f>fire and sulfur.
Ezekiel 38-23 So I will show my greatness and my <f>ⓛ</f>holiness and <f>ⓜ</f>make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then <f>ⓝ</f>they will know that I am the LORD.
