Revelation 4-1 <pb/>After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me <f>ⓐ</f>like a trumpet, said, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“Come up here, and <f>ⓒ</f>I will show you what must take place after this.”</J>
Revelation 4-2 At once <f>ⓓ</f>I was in the Spirit, and behold, <f>ⓔ</f>a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne.
Revelation 4-3 And he who sat there had the appearance of <f>ⓕ</f>jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was <f>ⓖ</f>a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.
Revelation 4-4 Around the throne were <f>ⓗ</f>twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, <f>ⓘ</f>clothed in white garments, with <f>ⓙ</f>golden crowns on their heads.
Revelation 4-5 From the throne came <f>ⓚ</f>flashes of lightning, and rumblings <f>[1]</f> and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning <f>ⓛ</f>seven torches of fire, <f>ⓜ</f>which are the seven spirits of God,
Revelation 4-6 and before the throne there was <f>ⓝ</f>as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. <pb/>And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are <f>ⓞ</f>four living creatures, <f>ⓟ</f>full of eyes in front and behind:
Revelation 4-7 <f>ⓠ</f> the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight.
Revelation 4-8 And the four living creatures, <f>ⓡ</f>each of them with six wings, are <f>ⓢ</f>full of eyes all around and within, and <f>ⓣ</f>day and night they never cease to say, <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>who was and is and is to come!” </t>
Revelation 4-9 <pb/>And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, <f>ⓦ</f>who lives forever and ever,
Revelation 4-10 the twenty-four elders <f>ⓧ</f>fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast <f>ⓨ</f>their crowns before the throne, saying,
Revelation 4-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f> “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, </t><t>to receive glory and honor and power, </t><t>for <f>ⓐ</f>you created all things, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>by your will they existed and were created.” </t>
