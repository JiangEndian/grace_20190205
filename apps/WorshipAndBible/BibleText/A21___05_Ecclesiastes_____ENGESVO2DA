Ecclesiastes 5-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>Guard your steps when you go to <f>ⓑ</f>the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to <f>ⓒ</f>offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.
Ecclesiastes 5-2 <f>[2]</f> Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore <f>ⓓ</f>let your words be few.
Ecclesiastes 5-3 For a dream comes with much business, and a fool's voice with <f>ⓔ</f>many words.
Ecclesiastes 5-4 <pb/>When <f>ⓕ</f>you vow a vow to God, <f>ⓖ</f>do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. <f>ⓗ</f>Pay what you vow.
Ecclesiastes 5-5 <f>ⓘ</f> It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes 5-6 Let not your mouth lead you <f>[3]</f> into sin, and do not say before <f>ⓙ</f>the messenger <f>[4]</f> that it was <f>ⓚ</f>a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
Ecclesiastes 5-7 For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; <f>[5]</f> but <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>God is the one you must fear.
Ecclesiastes 5-8 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, <f>ⓝ</f>do not be amazed at the matter, <f>ⓞ</f>for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.
Ecclesiastes 5-9 But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields. <f>[7]</f>
Ecclesiastes 5-10 <pb/>He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 5-11 When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes?
Ecclesiastes 5-12 Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.
Ecclesiastes 5-13 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,
Ecclesiastes 5-14 and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand.
Ecclesiastes 5-15 <f>ⓠ</f> As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand.
Ecclesiastes 5-16 This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what <f>ⓡ</f>gain is there to him who <f>ⓢ</f>toils for the wind?
Ecclesiastes 5-17 Moreover, all his days he <f>ⓣ</f>eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.
Ecclesiastes 5-18 <pb/>Behold, what I have seen to be <f>ⓤ</f>good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment <f>[8]</f> in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his <f>ⓥ</f>lot.
Ecclesiastes 5-19 Everyone also to whom <f>ⓦ</f>God has given <f>ⓧ</f>wealth and possessions <f>ⓨ</f>and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil — this is <f>ⓩ</f>the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes 5-20 For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.
