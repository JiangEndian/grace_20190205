Judges 10-6 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD <f>ⓕ</f>and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, <f>ⓖ</f>the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. And they <f>ⓗ</f>forsook the LORD and did not serve him.
Judges 10-7 So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and <f>ⓘ</f>he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites,
Judges 10-8 and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.

Judges 10-12 The Sidonians also, and <f>ⓟ</f>the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, and you cried out to me, and I <f>ⓠ</f>saved you out of their hand.
Judges 10-13 Yet you have <f>ⓡ</f>forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more.
Judges 10-14 Go and cry out <f>ⓢ</f>to the gods whom you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.”
Judges 10-15 And the people of Israel said to the LORD, “We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you. Only please deliver us this day.”
Judges 10-16 So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and <f>ⓣ</f>he became impatient over the misery of Israel.
Judges 10-17 <pb/>Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead. And the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at <f>ⓤ</f>Mizpah.
Judges 10-18 And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? <f>ⓥ</f>He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
