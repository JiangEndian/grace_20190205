Matthew 7-1 <pb/><J><f>ⓐ</f> “Judge not, that you be not judged.</J>
Matthew 7-2 <J><f>ⓑ</f> For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and <f>ⓒ</f>with the measure you use it will be measured to you.</J>
Matthew 7-3 <J>Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but <f>ⓓ</f>do not notice the log that is in your own eye?</J>
Matthew 7-4 <J>Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye?</J>
Matthew 7-5 <J>You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.</J>
Matthew 7-6 <pb/><J><f>ⓔ</f> “Do not give <f>ⓕ</f>dogs what is holy, and do not throw your <f>ⓖ</f>pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.</J>
Matthew 7-7 <pb/><J><f>ⓗ</f> “Ask, <f>ⓘ</f>and it will be given to you; <f>ⓙ</f>seek, and you will find; <f>ⓚ</f>knock, and it will be opened to you.</J>
Matthew 7-8 <J>For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.</J>
Matthew 7-9 <J>Or which one of you, if his son asks him for <f>ⓛ</f>bread, will give him <f>ⓜ</f>a stone?</J>
Matthew 7-10 <J>Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?</J>
Matthew 7-11 <J>If you then, <f>ⓝ</f>who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will <f>ⓞ</f>your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!</J>
Matthew 7-12 <pb/><J>“So <f>ⓟ</f>whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is <f>ⓠ</f>the Law and the Prophets.</J>
Matthew 7-13 <pb/><J><f>ⓡ</f> “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy <f>[1]</f> that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many.</J>
Matthew 7-14 <J>For the gate is narrow and <f>ⓢ</f>the way is hard that leads to life, and <f>ⓣ</f>those who find it are few.</J>
Matthew 7-15 <pb/><J><f>ⓤ</f> “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are <f>ⓥ</f>ravenous wolves.</J>
Matthew 7-16 <J>You will recognize them <f>ⓦ</f>by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</J>
Matthew 7-17 <J>So, <f>ⓧ</f>every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.</J>
Matthew 7-18 <J>A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.</J>
Matthew 7-19 <J><f>ⓨ</f> Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</J>
Matthew 7-20 <J>Thus you will recognize them <f>ⓩ</f>by their fruits.</J>
Matthew 7-21 <pb/><J><f>ⓐ</f> “Not everyone who <f>ⓑ</f>says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will <f>ⓒ</f>enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who <f>ⓓ</f>does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</J>
Matthew 7-22 <J><f>ⓔ</f> On that day <f>ⓕ</f>many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not <f>ⓖ</f>prophesy in your name, and cast out demons <f>ⓗ</f>in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’</J>
Matthew 7-23 <J><f>ⓘ</f> And then will I declare to them, ‘I <f>ⓙ</f>never knew you; <f>ⓚ</f>depart from me, <f>ⓛ</f>you workers of lawlessness.’</J>
Matthew 7-24 <pb/><J><f>ⓜ</f> “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like <f>ⓝ</f>a wise man who built his house on the rock.</J>
Matthew 7-25 <J>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.</J>
Matthew 7-26 <J>And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like <f>ⓞ</f>a foolish man who built his house on the sand.</J>
Matthew 7-27 <J>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”</J>
Matthew 7-28 <pb/>And when Jesus finished these sayings, <f>ⓟ</f>the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
Matthew 7-29 <f>ⓠ</f> for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
