Revelation 21-1 <pb/>Then I saw <f>ⓐ</f>a new heaven and a new earth, for <f>ⓑ</f>the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
Revelation 21-2 And I saw <f>ⓒ</f>the holy city, <f>ⓓ</f>new Jerusalem, <f>ⓔ</f>coming down out of heaven from God, <f>ⓕ</f>prepared <f>ⓖ</f>as a bride adorned for her husband.
Revelation 21-3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, <f>ⓗ</f>the dwelling place <f>[1]</f> of God is with man. He will <f>ⓘ</f>dwell with them, and they will be his people, <f>[2]</f> and God himself will be with them as their God. <f>[3]</f>
Revelation 21-4 <f>ⓙ</f> He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and <f>ⓚ</f>death shall be no more, <f>ⓛ</f>neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”
Revelation 21-5 <pb/>And <f>ⓜ</f>he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I <f>ⓝ</f>am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for <f>ⓞ</f>these words are trustworthy and true.”
Revelation 21-6 And he said to me, <f>ⓟ</f>“It is done! <f>ⓠ</f>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. <f>ⓡ</f>To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.
Revelation 21-7 <f>ⓢ</f> The one who conquers will have this heritage, and <f>ⓣ</f>I will be his God and <f>ⓤ</f>he will be my son.
Revelation 21-8 <f>ⓥ</f> But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, <f>ⓦ</f>their portion will be in <f>ⓧ</f>the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is <f>ⓨ</f>the second death.”
Revelation 21-9 <pb/>Then came <f>ⓩ</f>one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of <f>ⓐ</f>the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you <f>ⓑ</f>the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
Revelation 21-10 And <f>ⓒ</f>he carried me away in the Spirit to <f>ⓓ</f>a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,
Revelation 21-11 <f>ⓔ</f> having the glory of God, <f>ⓕ</f>its radiance <f>ⓖ</f>like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
Revelation 21-12 It had a great, high wall, <f>ⓗ</f>with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed —
Revelation 21-13 on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
Revelation 21-14 And the wall of the city had twelve <f>ⓘ</f>foundations, and <f>ⓙ</f>on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Revelation 21-15 <pb/>And the one who spoke with me <f>ⓚ</f>had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.
Revelation 21-16 The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. <f>[4]</f> Its length and width and height are equal.
Revelation 21-17 He also measured its wall, 144 cubits <f>[5]</f> by <f>ⓛ</f>human measurement, which is also <f>ⓜ</f>an angel's measurement.
Revelation 21-18 The wall was built of <f>ⓝ</f>jasper, while the city was pure gold, like <f>ⓞ</f>clear glass.
Revelation 21-19 <f>ⓟ</f> The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
Revelation 21-20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
Revelation 21-21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and <f>ⓠ</f>the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
Revelation 21-22 <pb/>And <f>ⓡ</f>I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
Revelation 21-23 And the city <f>ⓢ</f>has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for <f>ⓣ</f>the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.
Revelation 21-24 By its light <f>ⓤ</f>will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth <f>ⓥ</f>will bring their glory into it,
Revelation 21-25 and <f>ⓦ</f>its gates will never be shut by day — and <f>ⓧ</f>there will be no night there.
Revelation 21-26 They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.
Revelation 21-27 But <f>ⓨ</f>nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's <f>ⓩ</f>book of life.
