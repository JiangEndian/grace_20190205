Obadiah 1-1 <pb/>The vision of Obadiah. <pb/><e>Edom Will Be Humbled</e> </pb> <pb/><t>Thus says the Lord GOD <f>ⓐ</f>concerning Edom: </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>We have heard a report from the LORD, </t><t>and a messenger has been sent among the nations: </t><t>“Rise up!

Obadiah 1-2 <t>Behold, I will make you small among the nations; </t><t>you shall be utterly despised. <f>[1]</f></t>
Obadiah 1-3 <t><f>ⓒ</f> The pride of your heart has deceived you, </t><t>you who live in the clefts of the rock, <f>[2]</f> </t><t>in your lofty dwelling, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>who say in your heart, </t><t>“Who will bring me down to the ground?”</t>
Obadiah 1-4 <t>Though you soar aloft like the eagle, </t><t>though your nest is set among the stars, </t><t>from there I will bring you down, <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
Obadiah 1-5 <pb/><t>If <f>ⓔ</f>thieves came to you, </t><t>if plunderers came by night — </t><t>how you have been destroyed! — </t><t>would they not steal only enough for themselves? </t><t>If <f>ⓕ</f>grape gatherers came to you, </t><t>would they not leave gleanings?</t>
Obadiah 1-6 <t><f>ⓖ</f> How Esau has been pillaged, </t><t>his treasures sought out!</t>
Obadiah 1-7 <t>All your allies have driven you to your border; </t><t>those at peace with you have deceived you; </t><t>they have prevailed against you; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>those who eat your bread <f>[3]</f> have set a trap beneath you — </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>you have <f>[4]</f> no understanding. </t>
Obadiah 1-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Will I not on that day, declares the LORD, </t><t>destroy the wise men out of Edom, </t><t>and understanding out of <f>ⓚ</f>Mount Esau?</t>
