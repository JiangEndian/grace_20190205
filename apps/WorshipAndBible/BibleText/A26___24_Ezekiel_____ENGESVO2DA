Ezekiel 24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 24-2 <f>ⓑ</f> “Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.
Ezekiel 24-3 And <f>ⓒ</f>utter a parable to <f>ⓓ</f>the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t>“Set on <f>ⓔ</f>the pot, set it on; </t><t>pour in water also;</t>
Ezekiel 24-4 <t>put in it the pieces of meat, </t><t>all the good pieces, <f>ⓕ</f>the thigh and the shoulder; </t><t>fill it with choice bones.</t>
Ezekiel 24-5 <t>Take the choicest one of the flock; </t><t>pile the logs <f>[1]</f> under it; </t><t>boil it well; </t><t>seethe also its bones in it. </t>
Ezekiel 24-6 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓖ</f>Woe to the bloody city, to <f>ⓗ</f>the pot whose corrosion is in it, and whose corrosion has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, without making any choice. <f>[2]</f>
Ezekiel 24-7 For the blood she has shed is in her midst; she put it on <f>ⓘ</f>the bare rock; <f>ⓙ</f>she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust.
Ezekiel 24-8 To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered.
Ezekiel 24-9 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city! <f>ⓚ</f>I also will make the pile great.
Ezekiel 24-10 Heap on the logs, kindle the fire, boil the meat well, mix in the spices, <f>[3]</f> and let the bones be burned up.
Ezekiel 24-11 Then set it empty upon the coals, that it may become hot, and its copper may burn, <f>ⓛ</f>that its uncleanness may be melted in it, its corrosion consumed.
Ezekiel 24-12 <f>ⓜ</f> She has wearied herself with toil; <f>[4]</f> its abundant corrosion does not go out of it. Into the fire with its corrosion!
Ezekiel 24-13 On account of your unclean lewdness, because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your uncleanness, <f>ⓝ</f>you shall not be cleansed anymore till <f>ⓞ</f>I have satisfied my fury upon you.
Ezekiel 24-14 <f>ⓟ</f> I am the LORD. I have spoken; it shall come to pass; I will do it. I will not go back; <f>ⓠ</f>I will not spare; <f>ⓡ</f>I will not relent; <f>ⓢ</f>according to your ways and your deeds you will be judged, declares the Lord GOD.”
Ezekiel 24-15 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 24-16 <f>ⓣ</f> “Son of man, behold, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down.
Ezekiel 24-17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. <f>ⓤ</f>Bind on your turban, and <f>ⓥ</f>put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, <f>ⓦ</f>nor eat the bread of men.”
Ezekiel 24-18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and <f>ⓧ</f>at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did <f>ⓨ</f>as I was commanded.
Ezekiel 24-19 <pb/>And <f>ⓩ</f>the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting thus?”
Ezekiel 24-20 Then I said to them, “The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 24-21 ‘Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓐ</f>Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and <f>ⓑ</f>your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.
Ezekiel 24-22 And <f>ⓒ</f>you shall do as I have done; <f>ⓓ</f>you shall not cover your lips, <f>ⓔ</f>nor eat the bread of men.
Ezekiel 24-23 <f>ⓕ</f> Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but <f>ⓖ</f>you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan to one another.
Ezekiel 24-24 Thus shall Ezekiel be to you <f>ⓗ</f>a sign; <f>ⓘ</f>according to all that he has done you shall do. When this comes, then <f>ⓙ</f>you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’
Ezekiel 24-25 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓚ</f>son of man, surely on the day when I take from them <f>ⓛ</f>their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their soul's desire, and also their sons and daughters,
Ezekiel 24-26 <f>ⓜ</f> on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news.
Ezekiel 24-27 On that day your mouth <f>ⓝ</f>will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer mute. <f>ⓞ</f>So you will be a sign to them, and <f>ⓟ</f>they will know that I am the LORD.”
