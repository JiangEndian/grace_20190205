Ezekiel 20-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of <f>ⓑ</f>the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>and sat before me.
Ezekiel 20-2 And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 20-3 <f>ⓓ</f> “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD, Is it to inquire of me that you come? <f>ⓔ</f>As I live, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓕ</f>I will not be inquired of by you.
Ezekiel 20-4 <f>ⓖ</f> Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? <f>ⓗ</f>Let them know the abominations of their fathers,
Ezekiel 20-5 and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓘ</f>On the day when I chose Israel, <f>ⓙ</f>I swore <f>[1]</f> to the offspring of the house of Jacob, <f>ⓚ</f>making myself known to them in the land of Egypt; <f>ⓛ</f>I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.
Ezekiel 20-6 On that day I swore to them that <f>ⓜ</f>I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land <f>ⓝ</f>flowing with milk and honey, <f>ⓞ</f>the most glorious of all lands.
Ezekiel 20-7 And I said to them, <f>ⓟ</f>‘Cast away the detestable things <f>ⓠ</f>your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with <f>ⓡ</f>the idols of Egypt; <f>ⓢ</f>I am the LORD your God.’
Ezekiel 20-8 <f>ⓣ</f> But they rebelled against me and were not willing to listen to me. <f>ⓤ</f>None of them cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. <pb/>“Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them <f>ⓥ</f>and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel 20-9 <f>ⓦ</f> But I acted <f>ⓧ</f>for the sake of my name, <f>ⓨ</f>that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, <f>ⓩ</f>in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel 20-10 <f>ⓐ</f> So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel 20-11 <f>ⓑ</f> I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules, <f>ⓒ</f>by which, if a person does them, he shall live.
Ezekiel 20-12 Moreover, I gave them <f>ⓓ</f>my Sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, <f>ⓔ</f>that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
Ezekiel 20-13 <f>ⓕ</f> But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. <f>ⓖ</f>They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; <f>ⓗ</f>and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned. <pb/><f>ⓘ</f>“Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them.
Ezekiel 20-14 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, <f>ⓙ</f>in whose sight I had brought them out.
Ezekiel 20-15 Moreover, <f>ⓚ</f>I swore to them in the wilderness <f>ⓛ</f>that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land <f>ⓜ</f>flowing with milk and honey, <f>ⓝ</f>the most glorious of all lands,
Ezekiel 20-16 because they rejected my rules and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; <f>ⓞ</f>for their heart went after their idols.
Ezekiel 20-17 Nevertheless, <f>ⓟ</f>my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or <f>ⓠ</f>make a full end of them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel 20-18 <pb/>“And I said to <f>ⓡ</f>their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk <f>ⓢ</f>in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their rules, <f>ⓣ</f>nor defile yourselves with their idols.
Ezekiel 20-19 <f>ⓤ</f> I am the LORD your God; <f>ⓥ</f>walk in my statutes, and be careful to obey my rules,
Ezekiel 20-20 and <f>ⓦ</f>keep my Sabbaths holy that <f>ⓧ</f>they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.’
Ezekiel 20-21 <f>ⓨ</f> But the children <f>ⓩ</f>rebelled against me. <f>ⓐ</f>They did not walk in my statutes and were not careful to obey my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; they profaned my Sabbaths. <pb/><f>ⓑ</f>“Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel 20-22 <f>ⓒ</f> But I withheld my hand <f>ⓓ</f>and acted for the sake of my name, <f>ⓔ</f>that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.
Ezekiel 20-23 <f>ⓕ</f> Moreover, <f>ⓖ</f>I swore to them in the wilderness <f>ⓗ</f>that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,
Ezekiel 20-24 because they had not obeyed my rules, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, <f>ⓘ</f>and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols.
Ezekiel 20-25 <f>ⓙ</f> Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and rules by which they could not have life,
Ezekiel 20-26 and I defiled them through <f>ⓚ</f>their very gifts <f>ⓛ</f>in their offering up all their firstborn, that I might devastate them. I did it <f>ⓜ</f>that they might know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 20-27 <pb/>“Therefore, <f>ⓝ</f>son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this also your fathers blasphemed me, by <f>ⓞ</f>dealing treacherously with me.
Ezekiel 20-28 For when I had brought them into the land that <f>ⓟ</f>I swore to give them, then wherever they saw <f>ⓠ</f>any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and there they presented <f>ⓡ</f>the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their pleasing aromas, and there they poured out their drink offerings.
Ezekiel 20-29 (I said to them, <f>ⓢ</f>‘What is the high place to which you go?’ So its name is called Bamah <f>[2]</f> to this day.)
Ezekiel 20-30 <pb/>“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓣ</f>Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go <f>ⓤ</f>whoring after their detestable things?
Ezekiel 20-31 When you present your gifts and <f>ⓥ</f>offer up your children in fire, <f>[3]</f> you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And <f>ⓦ</f>shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? <f>ⓧ</f>As I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.
Ezekiel 20-32 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> “What is in your mind shall never happen — the thought, <f>ⓩ</f>‘Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, <f>ⓐ</f>and worship wood and stone.’
Ezekiel 20-33 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> “As I live, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓒ</f>surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and <f>ⓓ</f>with wrath poured out I will be king over you.
Ezekiel 20-34 <f>ⓔ</f> I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out.
Ezekiel 20-35 <f>ⓕ</f> And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, <f>ⓖ</f>and there I will enter into judgment with you <f>ⓗ</f>face to face.
Ezekiel 20-36 <f>ⓘ</f> As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 20-37 I will make you <f>ⓙ</f>pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
Ezekiel 20-38 <f>ⓚ</f> I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me. <f>ⓛ</f>I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, <f>ⓜ</f>but they shall not enter the land of Israel. <f>ⓝ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 20-39 <pb/>“As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓞ</f>Go serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; <f>ⓟ</f>but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.
Ezekiel 20-40 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, there <f>ⓡ</f>all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land. <f>ⓢ</f>There I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred offerings.
Ezekiel 20-41 As a pleasing aroma I will accept you, when <f>ⓣ</f>I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered. And <f>ⓤ</f>I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel 20-42 <f>ⓥ</f> And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country that <f>ⓦ</f>I swore to give to your fathers.
Ezekiel 20-43 <f>ⓧ</f> And there you shall remember your ways and all your deeds with which you have defiled yourselves, <f>ⓨ</f>and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed.
Ezekiel 20-44 And you shall know that I am the LORD, <f>ⓩ</f>when I deal with you for my name's sake, <f>ⓐ</f>not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.”
Ezekiel 20-45 <pb/><f>[4]</f> And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 20-46 <f>ⓑ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓒ</f>set your face toward the southland; <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb.
Ezekiel 20-47 Say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, <f>ⓔ</f>I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every <f>ⓕ</f>green tree in you and every <f>ⓖ</f>dry tree. The blazing flame shall not be quenched, and <f>ⓗ</f>all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.
Ezekiel 20-48 <f>ⓘ</f> All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.”
Ezekiel 20-49 Then I said, <f>ⓙ</f>“Ah, Lord GOD! They are saying of me, <f>ⓚ</f>‘Is he not a maker of parables?’”
