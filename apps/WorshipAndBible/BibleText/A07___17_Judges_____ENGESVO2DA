Judges 17-1 <pb/>There was a man of <f>ⓐ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
Judges 17-2 And he said to his mother, “The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, <f>ⓑ</f>“Blessed be my son by the LORD.”
Judges 17-3 And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, “I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make <f>ⓒ</f>a carved image and <f>ⓓ</f>a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.”
Judges 17-4 So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother <f>ⓔ</f>took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah.
Judges 17-5 And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made <f>ⓕ</f>an ephod and <f>ⓖ</f>household gods, and <f>ⓗ</f>ordained <f>[1]</f> one of his sons, who became his priest.
Judges 17-6 <f>ⓘ</f> In those days there was no king in Israel. <f>ⓙ</f>Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
Judges 17-7 <pb/>Now there was a young man of <f>ⓚ</f>Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
Judges 17-8 And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to <f>ⓛ</f>the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah.
Judges 17-9 And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place.”
Judges 17-10 And Micah said to him, “Stay with me, and be to me <f>ⓜ</f>a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living.” And the Levite went in.
Judges 17-11 And the Levite <f>ⓝ</f>was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons.
Judges 17-12 And Micah <f>ⓞ</f>ordained the Levite, and the young man <f>ⓟ</f>became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
Judges 17-13 Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest.”
