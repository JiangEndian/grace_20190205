Jonah 2-1 <pb/>Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish,
Jonah 2-2 saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f>“I called out to the LORD, out of my distress, </t><t>and he answered me; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>out of the belly of Sheol I cried, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and you heard my voice.</t>
Jonah 2-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> For you cast me into the deep, </t><t>into the heart of the seas, </t><t>and the flood surrounded me; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>all your waves and your billows </t><t>passed over me.</t>
Jonah 2-4 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Then I said, ‘I am driven away </t><t>from your sight; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>yet I shall again look </t><t>upon your holy temple.’</t>
Jonah 2-5 <t><f>ⓗ</f> The waters closed in over me <f>ⓘ</f>to take my life; </t><t>the deep surrounded me; </t><t>weeds were wrapped about my head</t>
Jonah 2-6 <t>at the roots of the mountains. </t><t>I went down to the land </t><t>whose bars closed upon me forever; </t><t>yet you brought up my life from the pit, </t><t>O LORD my God.</t>
Jonah 2-7 <t>When my life was fainting away, </t><t>I remembered the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>and my prayer came to you, </t><t>into your holy temple.</t>
Jonah 2-8 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Those who pay regard to vain idols </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>forsake their hope of steadfast love.</t>
Jonah 2-9 <t><f>ⓜ</f> But I with the voice of thanksgiving </t><t>will sacrifice to you; </t><t>what I have vowed I will pay. </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>Salvation belongs to the LORD!” </t>
Jonah 2-10 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.
