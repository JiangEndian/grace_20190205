Luke 11-1 <pb/>Now Jesus <f>[1]</f> was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, <f>ⓐ</f>as John taught his disciples.”
Luke 11-2 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“When you pray, say:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓒ</f>“Father, <f>ⓓ</f>hallowed be <f>ⓔ</f>your name.</J> </t><t><J> <f>ⓕ</f>Your kingdom come.</J></t>
Luke 11-3 <t><J><f>ⓖ</f> Give us <f>ⓗ</f>each day our daily bread, <f>[2]</f></J></t>
Luke 11-4 <t><J>and <f>ⓘ</f>forgive us our sins,</J> </t><t><J>for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.</J> </t><t><J>And <f>ⓙ</f>lead us not into temptation.”</J> </t>
Luke 11-5 <pb/>And he said to them, <J>“Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves,</J>
Luke 11-6 <J>for a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him’;</J>
Luke 11-7 <J>and he will answer from within, ‘Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything’?</J>
Luke 11-8 <J>I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything <f>ⓚ</f>because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence <f>[3]</f> he will rise and give him whatever he needs.</J>
Luke 11-9 <J>And I tell you, <f>ⓛ</f>ask, and <f>ⓜ</f>it will be given to you; <f>ⓝ</f>seek, and you will find; <f>ⓞ</f>knock, and it will be opened to you.</J>
Luke 11-10 <J>For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.</J>
Luke 11-11 <J>What father among you, if his son asks for <f>[4]</f> a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent;</J>
Luke 11-12 <J>or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</J>
Luke 11-13 <J>If you then, <f>ⓟ</f>who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father <f>ⓠ</f>give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</J>
Luke 11-14 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marveled.
Luke 11-15 But some of them said, “He casts out demons <f>ⓢ</f>by Beelzebul, the prince of demons,”
Luke 11-16 while others, <f>ⓣ</f>to test him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven.
Luke 11-17 <f>ⓤ</f> But he, <f>ⓥ</f>knowing their thoughts, said to them, <J>“Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls.</J>
Luke 11-18 <J>And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.</J>
Luke 11-19 <J>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, <f>ⓦ</f>by whom do <f>ⓧ</f>your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</J>
Luke 11-20 <J>But if it is by <f>ⓨ</f>the finger of God that I cast out demons, then <f>ⓩ</f>the kingdom of God has come upon you.</J>
Luke 11-21 <J>When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are safe;</J>
Luke 11-22 <J><f>ⓐ</f> but when one stronger than he attacks him and <f>ⓑ</f>overcomes him, he takes away his <f>ⓒ</f>armor in which he trusted and <f>ⓓ</f>divides his spoil.</J>
Luke 11-23 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</J>
Luke 11-24 <pb/><J><f>ⓕ</f> “When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through <f>ⓖ</f>waterless places seeking rest, and finding none it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’</J>
Luke 11-25 <J>And when it comes, it finds the house swept and put in order.</J>
Luke 11-26 <J>Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And <f>ⓗ</f>the last state of that person is worse than the first.”</J>
Luke 11-27 <pb/>As he said these things, <f>ⓘ</f>a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, <f>ⓙ</f>“Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed!”
Luke 11-28 But he said, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“Blessed rather are those <f>ⓛ</f>who hear the word of God and <f>ⓜ</f>keep it!”</J>
Luke 11-29 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“This generation is an evil generation. <f>ⓟ</f>It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.</J>
Luke 11-30 <J>For as <f>ⓠ</f>Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.</J>
Luke 11-31 <J><f>ⓡ</f> The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and <f>ⓢ</f>condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, <f>ⓣ</f>something greater than Solomon is here.</J>
Luke 11-32 <J><f>ⓤ</f> The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and <f>ⓥ</f>condemn it, for <f>ⓦ</f>they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, <f>ⓧ</f>something greater than Jonah is here.</J>
Luke 11-33 <pb/><J><f>ⓨ</f> “No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.</J>
Luke 11-34 <J>Your eye is <f>ⓩ</f>the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is <f>ⓐ</f>bad, your body is full of darkness.</J>
Luke 11-35 <J><f>ⓑ</f> Therefore be careful lest the light in you be darkness.</J>
Luke 11-36 <J>If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, <f>ⓒ</f>as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.”</J>
Luke 11-37 <pb/>While Jesus <f>[5]</f> was speaking, <f>ⓓ</f>a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table.
Luke 11-38 The Pharisee was astonished to see <f>ⓔ</f>that he did not first wash before dinner.
Luke 11-39 And the Lord said to him, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of <f>ⓖ</f>greed and wickedness.</J>
Luke 11-40 <J><f>ⓗ</f> You fools! <f>ⓘ</f>Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?</J>
Luke 11-41 <J>But <f>ⓙ</f>give as alms those things that are within, and behold, <f>ⓚ</f>everything is clean for you.</J>
Luke 11-42 <pb/><J><f>ⓛ</f> “But woe to you Pharisees! For <f>ⓜ</f>you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect <f>ⓝ</f>justice and <f>ⓞ</f>the love of God. <f>ⓟ</f>These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</J>
Luke 11-43 <J>Woe to you Pharisees! For <f>ⓠ</f>you love the best seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</J>
Luke 11-44 <J>Woe to you! <f>ⓡ</f>For you are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without knowing it.”</J>
Luke 11-45 <pb/>One of <f>ⓢ</f>the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also.”
Luke 11-46 And he said, <J>“Woe to you <f>ⓣ</f>lawyers also! For <f>ⓤ</f>you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</J>
Luke 11-47 <J><f>ⓥ</f> Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed.</J>
Luke 11-48 <J><f>ⓦ</f> So you are witnesses and you <f>ⓧ</f>consent to the deeds of <f>ⓨ</f>your fathers, for they killed them, and you build their tombs.</J>
Luke 11-49 <J>Therefore also <f>ⓩ</f>the Wisdom of God said, <f>ⓐ</f>‘I will send them <f>ⓑ</f>prophets and apostles, <f>ⓒ</f>some of whom they will <f>ⓓ</f>kill and persecute,’</J>
Luke 11-50 <J>so that <f>ⓔ</f>the blood of all the prophets, shed <f>ⓕ</f>from the foundation of the world, may be <f>ⓖ</f>charged against this generation,</J>
Luke 11-51 <J>from the blood of <f>ⓗ</f>Abel to the blood of <f>ⓘ</f>Zechariah, who perished between <f>ⓙ</f>the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be <f>ⓚ</f>required of this generation.</J>
Luke 11-52 <J>Woe to you <f>ⓛ</f>lawyers! <f>ⓜ</f>For you have taken away the key of <f>ⓝ</f>knowledge. You <f>ⓞ</f>did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.”</J>
Luke 11-53 <pb/>As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard and to provoke him to speak about many things,
Luke 11-54 <f>ⓟ</f> lying in wait for him, <f>ⓠ</f>to catch him in something he might say.
