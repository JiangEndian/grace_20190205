Genesis 16-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was <f>ⓑ</f>Hagar.
Genesis 16-2 And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children <f>[1]</f> by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
Genesis 16-3 So, after Abram <f>ⓒ</f>had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.
Genesis 16-4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, <f>ⓓ</f>she looked with contempt on her mistress. <f>[2]</f>
Genesis 16-5 And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD judge between you and me!”
Genesis 16-6 But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.
Genesis 16-7 <pb/>The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to <f>ⓕ</f>Shur.
Genesis 16-8 And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.”
Genesis 16-9 The angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her.”
Genesis 16-10 The angel of the LORD also said to her, <f>ⓖ</f>“I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.”
Genesis 16-11 And the angel of the LORD said to her, <pb/><t>“Behold, you are pregnant </t><t>and shall bear a son. </t><t>You shall call his name Ishmael, <f>[3]</f> </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>because the LORD has listened to your affliction.</t>
Genesis 16-12 <t>He shall be <f>ⓘ</f>a wild donkey of a man, </t><t>his hand against everyone </t><t>and everyone's hand against him, </t><t>and he shall dwell <f>ⓙ</f>over against all his kinsmen.” </t>
Genesis 16-13 <pb/>So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God of seeing,” <f>[4]</f> for she said, <f>ⓚ</f>“Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.” <f>[5]</f>
Genesis 16-14 Therefore the well was called <f>ⓛ</f>Beer-lahai-roi; <f>[6]</f> it lies between <f>ⓜ</f>Kadesh and Bered.
Genesis 16-15 <pb/>And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
Genesis 16-16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
