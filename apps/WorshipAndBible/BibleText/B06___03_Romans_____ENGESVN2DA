Romans 3-1 <pb/>Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?
Romans 3-2 Much in every way. To begin with, <f>ⓐ</f>the Jews were entrusted with <f>ⓑ</f>the oracles of God.
Romans 3-3 <f>ⓒ</f> What if some were unfaithful? <f>ⓓ</f>Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?
Romans 3-4 By no means! <f>ⓔ</f>Let God be true though <f>ⓕ</f>every one were a liar, as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“That you may be justified in your words, </t><t>and prevail when you <f>ⓗ</f>are judged.” </t>
Romans 3-5 <pb/>But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict <f>ⓘ</f>wrath on us? (<f>ⓙ</f>I speak in a human way.)
Romans 3-6 By no means! For then how could <f>ⓚ</f>God judge the world?
Romans 3-7 But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, <f>ⓛ</f>why am I still being condemned as a sinner?
Romans 3-8 And why not <f>ⓜ</f>do evil that good may come? — as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.
Romans 3-9 <pb/>What then? Are we Jews <f>[1]</f> any better off? <f>[2]</f> No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both <f>ⓝ</f>Jews and <f>ⓞ</f>Greeks, are <f>ⓟ</f>under sin,
Romans 3-10 as it is written: <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f>“None is righteous, no, not one;</t>
Romans 3-11 <t>no one understands; </t><t>no one seeks for God.</t>
Romans 3-12 <t>All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; </t><t>no one does good, </t><t>not even one.”</t>
Romans 3-13 <t><f>ⓡ</f> “Their throat is <f>ⓢ</f>an open grave; </t><t>they use their tongues to deceive.” </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>“The venom of asps is under their lips.”</t>
Romans 3-14 <t><f>ⓤ</f> “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”</t>
Romans 3-15 <t><f>ⓥ</f> “Their feet are swift to shed blood;</t>
Romans 3-16 <t>in their paths are ruin and misery,</t>
Romans 3-17 <t>and <f>ⓦ</f>the way of peace they have not known.”</t>
Romans 3-18 <t><f>ⓧ</f> “There is no fear of God before their eyes.” </t>
Romans 3-19 <pb/>Now we know that whatever <f>ⓨ</f>the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, <f>ⓩ</f>so that every mouth may be stopped, and <f>ⓐ</f>the whole world may be held accountable to God.
Romans 3-20 For <f>ⓑ</f>by works of the law no human being <f>[3]</f> will be justified in his sight, since <f>ⓒ</f>through the law comes knowledge of sin.
Romans 3-21 <pb/>But now <f>ⓓ</f>the righteousness of God <f>ⓔ</f>has been manifested apart from the law, although <f>ⓕ</f>the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it —
Romans 3-22 the righteousness of God <f>ⓖ</f>through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. <f>ⓗ</f>For there is no distinction:
Romans 3-23 for <f>ⓘ</f>all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
Romans 3-24 <f>ⓙ</f> and are justified <f>ⓚ</f>by his grace as a gift, <f>ⓛ</f>through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
Romans 3-25 whom God <f>ⓜ</f>put forward as <f>ⓝ</f>a propitiation <f>ⓞ</f>by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in <f>ⓟ</f>his divine forbearance he had passed over <f>ⓠ</f>former sins.
Romans 3-26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
Romans 3-27 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.
Romans 3-28 For we hold that one is justified by faith <f>ⓢ</f>apart from works of the law.
Romans 3-29 Or <f>ⓣ</f>is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
Romans 3-30 since <f>ⓤ</f>God is one — who will justify the circumcised by faith and <f>ⓥ</f>the uncircumcised through faith.
Romans 3-31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
