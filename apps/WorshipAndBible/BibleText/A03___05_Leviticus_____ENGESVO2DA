Leviticus 5-1 <pb/>“If anyone sins in that he hears a public <f>ⓐ</f>adjuration to testify, and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall <f>ⓑ</f>bear his iniquity;
Leviticus 5-2 or <f>ⓒ</f>if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean, and he realizes his guilt;
Leviticus 5-3 or if he touches <f>ⓓ</f>human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and realizes his guilt;
Leviticus 5-4 or if anyone utters with his lips a <f>ⓔ</f>rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that people <f>ⓕ</f>swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and he realizes his guilt in any of these;
Leviticus 5-5 when he realizes his guilt in any of these and <f>ⓖ</f>confesses the sin he has committed,
Leviticus 5-6 he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation <f>[1]</f> for the sin that he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin.
Leviticus 5-7 <pb/>“But <f>ⓗ</f>if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation for the sin that he has committed two <f>ⓘ</f>turtledoves or two pigeons, <f>[2]</f> one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.
Leviticus 5-8 He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering. He shall <f>ⓙ</f>wring its head from its neck <f>ⓚ</f>but shall not sever it completely,
Leviticus 5-9 and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while <f>ⓛ</f>the rest of the blood shall be drained out <f>ⓜ</f>at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus 5-10 Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the rule. <f>ⓝ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus 5-11 <pb/>“But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for the sin that he has committed a <f>ⓞ</f>tenth of an ephah <f>[3]</f> of fine flour for a sin offering. He <f>ⓟ</f>shall put no oil on it and shall put no frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
Leviticus 5-12 And he shall bring it to <f>ⓠ</f>the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and <f>ⓡ</f>burn this on the altar, on the LORD's food offerings; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus 5-13 Thus <f>ⓢ</f>the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder <f>[4]</f> shall be for the priest, as in the grain offering.”
Leviticus 5-14 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 5-15 <f>ⓣ</f> “If anyone commits a breach of faith and sins unintentionally in any of the holy things of the LORD, <f>ⓤ</f>he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation, a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued <f>[5]</f> in silver shekels, <f>[6]</f> according to the <f>ⓥ</f>shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering.
Leviticus 5-16 He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and <f>ⓦ</f>shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest. <f>ⓧ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus 5-17 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> “If anyone sins, doing any of the things that by the LORD's commandments ought not to be done, <f>ⓩ</f>though he did not know it, then realizes his guilt, he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus 5-18 <f>ⓐ</f> He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock, or its equivalent, for a guilt offering, and <f>ⓑ</f>the priest shall make atonement for him for the mistake that he made unintentionally, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus 5-19 It is a guilt offering; he has indeed incurred guilt before <f>[7]</f> the LORD.”
