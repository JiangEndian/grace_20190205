Isaiah 58-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Yet they seek me daily </t><t>and delight to know my ways, </t><t>as if they were a nation that did righteousness </t><t>and did not forsake the judgment of their God; </t><t>they ask of me righteous judgments; </t><t>they delight to draw near to God.</t>
Isaiah 58-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> ‘Why have we fasted, and you see it not? </t><t>Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?’ </t><t>Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>and oppress all your workers.</t>

Isaiah 58-5 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Is such the fast that I choose, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>a day for a person to humble himself? </t><t>Is it to bow down his head like a reed, </t><t>and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? </t><t>Will you call this a fast, </t><t>and a day acceptable to the LORD? </t>

Isaiah 58-9 <t>Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; </t><t>you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’ </t><t>If you take away <f>ⓟ</f>the yoke from your midst, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,</t>
Isaiah 58-10 <t><f>ⓡ</f> if you pour yourself out for the hungry </t><t>and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>then shall your light rise in the darkness </t><t>and your gloom be as the noonday.</t>
