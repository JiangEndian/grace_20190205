Colossians 1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>an apostle of Christ Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>by the will of God, and Timothy <f>ⓒ</f>our brother,
Colossians 1-2 <pb/>To the <f>ⓓ</f>saints and faithful brothers <f>[1]</f> in Christ at Colossae: <pb/><f>ⓔ</f>Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
Colossians 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
Colossians 1-4 since we heard of <f>ⓖ</f>your faith in Christ Jesus and of <f>ⓗ</f>the love that you have for all the saints,
Colossians 1-5 because of <f>ⓘ</f>the hope <f>ⓙ</f>laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in <f>ⓚ</f>the word of the truth, the gospel,
Colossians 1-6 which has come to you, as indeed <f>ⓛ</f>in the whole world it is <f>ⓜ</f>bearing fruit and increasing — as it also does among you, since the day you <f>ⓝ</f>heard it and understood <f>ⓞ</f>the grace of God in truth,
Colossians 1-7 just as you learned it from <f>ⓟ</f>Epaphras our beloved <f>ⓠ</f>fellow servant. <f>[2]</f> He is <f>ⓡ</f>a faithful minister of Christ on your <f>[3]</f> behalf
Colossians 1-8 and has made known to us your <f>ⓢ</f>love in the Spirit.
Colossians 1-9 <pb/>And so, <f>ⓣ</f>from the day we heard, <f>ⓤ</f>we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that <f>ⓥ</f>you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all <f>ⓦ</f>spiritual wisdom and understanding,
Colossians 1-10 so as <f>ⓧ</f>to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, <f>ⓨ</f>fully pleasing to him: <f>ⓩ</f>bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Colossians 1-11 <f>ⓐ</f> being strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for <f>ⓑ</f>all endurance and patience <f>ⓒ</f>with joy;
Colossians 1-12 <f>ⓓ</f> giving thanks <f>[4]</f> to the Father, who has qualified you <f>[5]</f> to share in <f>ⓔ</f>the inheritance of the saints in light.
Colossians 1-13 He <f>ⓕ</f>has delivered us from <f>ⓖ</f>the domain of darkness and transferred us to <f>ⓗ</f>the kingdom of <f>ⓘ</f>his beloved Son,
Colossians 1-14 <f>ⓙ</f> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
Colossians 1-15 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> He is the image of <f>ⓛ</f>the invisible God, <f>ⓜ</f>the firstborn of all creation.
Colossians 1-16 For by <f>[6]</f> him all things were created, <f>ⓝ</f>in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether <f>ⓞ</f>thrones or <f>ⓟ</f>dominions or rulers or authorities — all things were created <f>ⓠ</f>through him and for him.
Colossians 1-17 And <f>ⓡ</f>he is before all things, and in him all things <f>ⓢ</f>hold together.
Colossians 1-18 And <f>ⓣ</f>he is the head of the body, the church. He is <f>ⓤ</f>the beginning, <f>ⓥ</f>the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.
Colossians 1-19 For <f>ⓦ</f>in him all the <f>ⓧ</f>fullness of God was pleased to dwell,
Colossians 1-20 and <f>ⓨ</f>through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, <f>ⓩ</f>making peace <f>ⓐ</f>by the blood of his cross.
Colossians 1-21 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, <f>ⓒ</f>doing evil deeds,
Colossians 1-22 he has now reconciled <f>ⓓ</f>in his body of flesh by his death, <f>ⓔ</f>in order to present you holy and blameless and <f>ⓕ</f>above reproach before him,
Colossians 1-23 <f>ⓖ</f> if indeed you continue in the faith, <f>ⓗ</f>stable and steadfast, not shifting from <f>ⓘ</f>the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed <f>ⓙ</f>in all creation <f>[7]</f> under heaven, <f>ⓚ</f>and of which I, Paul, became a minister.
Colossians 1-24 <pb/>Now <f>ⓛ</f>I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh <f>ⓜ</f>I am filling up <f>ⓝ</f>what is lacking in Christ's afflictions <f>ⓞ</f>for the sake of his body, that is, the church,
Colossians 1-25 <f>ⓟ</f> of which I became a minister according to <f>ⓠ</f>the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,
Colossians 1-26 <f>ⓡ</f> the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints.
Colossians 1-27 <f>ⓢ</f> To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are <f>ⓣ</f>the riches of the glory of <f>ⓤ</f>this mystery, which is Christ in you, <f>ⓥ</f>the hope of glory.
Colossians 1-28 Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that <f>ⓦ</f>we may present everyone <f>ⓧ</f>mature in Christ.
Colossians 1-29 For this <f>ⓨ</f>I toil, <f>ⓩ</f>struggling <f>ⓐ</f>with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.
