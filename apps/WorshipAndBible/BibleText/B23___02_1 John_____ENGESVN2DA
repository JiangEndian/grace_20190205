1 John 2-1 <pb/>My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, <f>ⓐ</f>we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
1 John 2-2 <f>ⓑ</f> He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but <f>ⓒ</f>also for the sins of the whole world.
1 John 2-3 And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we <f>ⓓ</f>keep his commandments.
1 John 2-4 Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments <f>ⓔ</f>is a liar, and <f>ⓕ</f>the truth is not in him,
1 John 2-5 but whoever <f>ⓖ</f>keeps his word, in him truly <f>ⓗ</f>the love of God is perfected. <f>ⓘ</f>By this we may know that we are in him:
1 John 2-6 whoever says he <f>ⓙ</f>abides in him <f>ⓚ</f>ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.
1 John 2-7 <pb/>Beloved, I am writing you <f>ⓛ</f>no new commandment, but <f>ⓜ</f>an old commandment <f>ⓝ</f>that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard.
1 John 2-8 At the same time, it is <f>ⓞ</f>a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>the darkness is passing away and <f>ⓠ</f>the true light is already shining.
1 John 2-9 Whoever says he is in the light and <f>ⓡ</f>hates his brother is still in darkness.
1 John 2-10 Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him <f>[2]</f> there is no <f>ⓢ</f>cause for stumbling.
1 John 2-11 But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and <f>ⓣ</f>walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
1 John 2-12 <pb/><t>I am writing to you, little children, </t><t>because <f>ⓤ</f>your sins are forgiven for his name's sake.</t>
1 John 2-13 <t>I am writing to you, fathers, </t><t>because you know <f>ⓥ</f>him who is from the beginning. </t><t>I am writing to you, young men, </t><t>because <f>ⓦ</f>you have overcome the evil one. </t><t>I write to you, children, </t><t>because <f>ⓧ</f>you know the Father.</t>
1 John 2-14 <t>I write to you, fathers, </t><t>because you know <f>ⓨ</f>him who is from the beginning. </t><t>I write to you, young men, </t><t>because <f>ⓩ</f>you are strong, </t><t>and the word of God abides in you, </t><t>and you have overcome the evil one. </t>
1 John 2-15 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Do not love the world or the things in the world. <f>ⓑ</f>If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
1 John 2-16 For all that is in the world — <f>ⓒ</f>the desires of the flesh and <f>ⓓ</f>the desires of the eyes and pride of life <f>[3]</f> — is not from the Father but is from the world.
1 John 2-17 And <f>ⓔ</f>the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
1 John 2-18 <pb/>Children, <f>ⓕ</f>it is the last hour, and as you have heard that <f>ⓖ</f>antichrist is coming, so now <f>ⓗ</f>many antichrists have come. <f>ⓘ</f>Therefore we know that it is the last hour.
1 John 2-19 <f>ⓙ</f> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for <f>ⓚ</f>if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, <f>ⓛ</f>that it might become plain that they all are not of us.
1 John 2-20 But you have been <f>ⓜ</f>anointed by <f>ⓝ</f>the Holy One, and <f>ⓞ</f>you all have knowledge. <f>[4]</f>
1 John 2-21 I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
1 John 2-22 Who is the liar but <f>ⓟ</f>he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is <f>ⓠ</f>the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.
1 John 2-23 <f>ⓡ</f> No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.
1 John 2-24 Let <f>ⓢ</f>what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then <f>ⓣ</f>you too will abide in the Son and in the Father.
1 John 2-25 And this is the promise that he made to us <f>[5]</f> — <f>ⓤ</f>eternal life.
1 John 2-26 <pb/>I write these things to you about <f>ⓥ</f>those who are trying to deceive you.
1 John 2-27 But <f>ⓦ</f>the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and <f>ⓧ</f>you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and <f>ⓨ</f>is true, and is no lie — just as it has taught you, abide in him.
1 John 2-28 <pb/>And now, little children, abide in him, so that <f>ⓩ</f>when he appears <f>ⓐ</f>we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his <f>ⓑ</f>coming.
1 John 2-29 If you know that <f>ⓒ</f>he is righteous, you may be sure that <f>ⓓ</f>everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.
