Isaiah 10-1 <pb/><t>Woe to those who <f>ⓐ</f>decree iniquitous decrees, </t><t>and the writers who <f>ⓑ</f>keep writing oppression,</t>

Isaiah 10-3 <t>What will you do on <f>ⓓ</f>the day of punishment, </t><t>in the ruin that will come <f>ⓔ</f>from afar? </t><t>To whom will you flee for help, </t><t>and where will you leave your wealth?</t>
Isaiah 10-4 <t>Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners </t><t>or fall among the slain. </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>For all this his anger has not turned away, </t><t>and his hand is stretched out still. </t>

Isaiah 10-7 <t>But he <f>ⓚ</f>does not so intend, </t><t>and his heart does not so think; </t><t>but it is in his heart to destroy, </t><t>and to cut off nations not a few;</t>

Isaiah 10-10 <t>As my hand has reached to <f>ⓣ</f>the kingdoms of the idols, </t><t>whose carved images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria,</t>

Isaiah 10-14 <t>My hand has found like a nest </t><t>the wealth of the peoples; </t><t>and as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken, </t><t>so I have gathered all the earth; </t><t>and there was none that moved a wing </t><t>or opened the mouth or chirped.” </t>
Isaiah 10-15 <pb/><t>Shall <f>ⓩ</f>the axe boast over him who hews with it, </t><t>or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? </t><t>As if a rod should wield him who lifts it, </t><t>or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!</t>

Isaiah 10-18 <t>The glory of <f>ⓖ</f>his forest and of his <f>ⓗ</f>fruitful land </t><t>the LORD will destroy, both soul and body, </t><t>and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.</t>
