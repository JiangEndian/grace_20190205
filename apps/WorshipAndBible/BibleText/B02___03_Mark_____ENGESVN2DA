Mark 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Again <f>ⓑ</f>he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand.
Mark 3-2 And <f>ⓒ</f>they watched Jesus, <f>[1]</f> to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.
Mark 3-3 And he said to the man with the withered hand, <J>“Come here.”</J>
Mark 3-4 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?”</J> But they were silent.
Mark 3-5 And he <f>ⓔ</f>looked around at them with anger, grieved at <f>ⓕ</f>their hardness of heart, and said to the man, <J>“Stretch out your hand.”</J> <f>ⓖ</f>He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
Mark 3-6 <f>ⓗ</f> The Pharisees went out and immediately <f>ⓘ</f>held counsel with <f>ⓙ</f>the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.
Mark 3-7 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and <f>ⓛ</f>a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea
Mark 3-8 and Jerusalem and <f>ⓜ</f>Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around <f>ⓝ</f>Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him.
Mark 3-9 And he told his disciples to <f>ⓞ</f>have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they <f>ⓟ</f>crush him,
Mark 3-10 for <f>ⓠ</f>he had healed many, so that all who had <f>ⓡ</f>diseases pressed around him <f>ⓢ</f>to touch him.
Mark 3-11 <f>ⓣ</f> And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they <f>ⓤ</f>fell down before him and cried out, “You are <f>ⓥ</f>the Son of God.”
Mark 3-12 And <f>ⓦ</f>he strictly ordered them not to make him known.
Mark 3-13 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> And he went up on the mountain and called to him those <f>ⓨ</f>whom he desired, and they came to him.
Mark 3-14 <f>ⓩ</f> And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach
Mark 3-15 <f>ⓐ</f> and have authority to cast out demons.
Mark 3-16 He appointed the twelve: <f>ⓑ</f>Simon (to whom <f>ⓒ</f>he gave the name Peter);
Mark 3-17 <f>ⓓ</f> James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);
Mark 3-18 Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and <f>ⓔ</f>Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, <f>[2]</f>
Mark 3-19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
Mark 3-20 <pb/>Then he went <f>ⓕ</f>home, and the crowd gathered again, <f>ⓖ</f>so that they could not even eat.
Mark 3-21 <f>ⓗ</f> And when <f>ⓘ</f>his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He <f>ⓙ</f>is out of his mind.”
Mark 3-22 <pb/>And <f>ⓚ</f>the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, <f>ⓛ</f>“He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.”
Mark 3-23 <f>ⓜ</f> And he called them to him and said to them in parables, <J>“How can Satan cast out Satan?</J>
Mark 3-24 <J>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</J>
Mark 3-25 <J>And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</J>
Mark 3-26 <J>And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.</J>
Mark 3-27 <J>But <f>ⓝ</f>no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. <f>ⓞ</f>Then indeed he may plunder his house.</J>
Mark 3-28 <pb/><J><f>ⓟ</f> “Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter,</J>
Mark 3-29 <J>but whoever <f>ⓠ</f>blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”</J> —
Mark 3-30 for they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
Mark 3-31 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And his mother and his <f>ⓢ</f>brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him.
Mark 3-32 And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers <f>[3]</f> are outside, seeking you.”
Mark 3-33 And he answered them, <J>“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</J>
Mark 3-34 And <f>ⓣ</f>looking about at those who sat around him, he said, <J>“Here are my mother and my brothers!</J>
Mark 3-35 <J><f>ⓤ</f> For whoever <f>ⓥ</f>does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.”</J>
