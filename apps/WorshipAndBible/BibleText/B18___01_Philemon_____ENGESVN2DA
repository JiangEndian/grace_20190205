Philemon 1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and <f>ⓑ</f>Timothy our brother, <pb/>To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
Philemon 1-2 and Apphia our sister and <f>ⓒ</f>Archippus our <f>ⓓ</f>fellow soldier, and <f>ⓔ</f>the church in your house:
Philemon 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon 1-4 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,
Philemon 1-5 because I <f>ⓗ</f>hear of your love and <f>ⓘ</f>of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,
Philemon 1-6 and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full <f>ⓙ</f>knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. <f>[1]</f>
Philemon 1-7 For I have derived much joy and <f>ⓚ</f>comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints <f>ⓛ</f>have been refreshed through you.
Philemon 1-8 <pb/>Accordingly, <f>ⓜ</f>though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do <f>ⓝ</f>what is required,
Philemon 1-9 yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you — I, Paul, an old man and now <f>ⓞ</f>a prisoner also for Christ Jesus —
Philemon 1-10 I appeal to you for <f>ⓟ</f>my child, <f>ⓠ</f>Onesimus, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>whose father I became in my imprisonment.
Philemon 1-11 (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)
Philemon 1-12 I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
Philemon 1-13 I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me <f>ⓢ</f>on your behalf <f>ⓣ</f>during my imprisonment for the gospel,
Philemon 1-14 but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be <f>ⓤ</f>by compulsion but of your own accord.
Philemon 1-15 For this perhaps is why <f>ⓥ</f>he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
Philemon 1-16 <f>ⓦ</f> no longer as a bondservant <f>[3]</f> but more than a bondservant, as <f>ⓧ</f>a beloved brother — especially to me, but how much more to you, <f>ⓨ</f>both in the flesh and in the Lord.
Philemon 1-17 <pb/>So if you consider me <f>ⓩ</f>your partner, receive him as you would receive me.
Philemon 1-18 If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
Philemon 1-19 <f>ⓐ</f> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it — to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
Philemon 1-20 Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. <f>ⓑ</f>Refresh my heart in Christ.
Philemon 1-21 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
Philemon 1-22 At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for <f>ⓓ</f>I am hoping that <f>ⓔ</f>through your prayers <f>ⓕ</f>I will be graciously given to you.
Philemon 1-23 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Epaphras, my <f>ⓗ</f>fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
Philemon 1-24 and so do <f>ⓘ</f>Mark, <f>ⓙ</f>Aristarchus, <f>ⓚ</f>Demas, and <f>ⓛ</f>Luke, my fellow workers.
Philemon 1-25 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
