Ezekiel 40-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the twenty-fifth year <f>ⓑ</f>of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, <f>ⓒ</f>in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day, <f>ⓓ</f>the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me to the city. <f>[1]</f>
Ezekiel 40-2 In <f>ⓔ</f>visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on <f>ⓕ</f>a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south.
Ezekiel 40-3 When he brought me there, behold, there was <f>ⓖ</f>a man whose appearance was <f>ⓗ</f>like bronze, with <f>ⓘ</f>a linen cord and <f>ⓙ</f>a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway.
Ezekiel 40-4 And the man said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“Son of man, <f>ⓛ</f>look with your eyes, and <f>ⓜ</f>hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. <f>ⓝ</f>Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”
Ezekiel 40-5 <pb/>And behold, there was <f>ⓞ</f>a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man's hand was six long cubits, <f>ⓟ</f>each being a cubit and a handbreadth <f>[2]</f> in length. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.
Ezekiel 40-6 Then he went into <f>ⓠ</f>the gateway facing east, <f>ⓡ</f>going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep. <f>[3]</f>
Ezekiel 40-7 And <f>ⓢ</f>the side rooms, one reed long and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed.

Ezekiel 40-10 And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate. <f>ⓤ</f>The three were of the same size, and the jambs on either side were of the same size.
Ezekiel 40-11 Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gateway, thirteen cubits.

Ezekiel 40-14 He measured also <f>ⓥ</f>the vestibule, sixty cubits. And around the vestibule of the gateway was the court. <f>[4]</f>
Ezekiel 40-15 From the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel 40-16 And the gateway had <f>ⓦ</f>windows all around, narrowing inwards toward the side rooms and toward their <f>ⓧ</f>jambs, and likewise the vestibule had windows all around inside, and on the jambs were <f>ⓨ</f>palm trees.
Ezekiel 40-17 <pb/>Then he brought me into <f>ⓩ</f>the outer court. And behold, there were <f>ⓐ</f>chambers and a <f>ⓑ</f>pavement, all around the court. <f>ⓒ</f>Thirty chambers faced the pavement.
Ezekiel 40-18 And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. This was the lower pavement.
Ezekiel 40-19 Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, <f>[5]</f> a hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side. <f>[6]</f>
Ezekiel 40-20 <pb/>As for <f>ⓓ</f>the gate that faced toward the north, belonging to <f>ⓔ</f>the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth.
