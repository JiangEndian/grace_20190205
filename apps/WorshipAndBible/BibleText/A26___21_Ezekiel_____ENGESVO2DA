Ezekiel 21-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 21-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>set your face toward Jerusalem and <f>ⓒ</f>preach against the sanctuaries. <f>[2]</f> Prophesy against the land of Israel
Ezekiel 21-3 and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓓ</f>Behold, I am against you and will draw <f>ⓔ</f>my sword from its sheath and <f>ⓕ</f>will cut off from you both righteous and wicked.
Ezekiel 21-4 Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north.
Ezekiel 21-5 <f>ⓖ</f> And all flesh shall know that I am the LORD. I have drawn <f>ⓗ</f>my sword from its sheath; <f>ⓘ</f>it shall not be sheathed again.
Ezekiel 21-6 <pb/>“As for you, son of man, <f>ⓙ</f>groan; with breaking heart and bitter grief, <f>ⓚ</f>groan before their eyes.
Ezekiel 21-7 <f>ⓛ</f> And when they say to you, ‘Why do you groan?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the news <f>ⓜ</f>that it is coming. <f>ⓝ</f>Every heart will melt, and <f>ⓞ</f>all hands will be feeble; every spirit will faint, and <f>ⓟ</f>all knees will be weak as water. <f>ⓠ</f>Behold, it is <f>ⓡ</f>coming, and it will be fulfilled,’” declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 21-8 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 21-9 <f>ⓢ</f> “Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, say: <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“A sword, a sword is sharpened </t><t>and also polished,</t>
Ezekiel 21-10 <t><f>ⓤ</f> sharpened for slaughter, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>polished to flash like lightning! </t> <pb/>(Or <f>ⓦ</f>shall we rejoice? You have despised the rod, my son, <f>ⓧ</f>with everything of wood.) <f>[3]</f>
Ezekiel 21-11 So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished <f>ⓨ</f>to be given into the hand of the slayer.
Ezekiel 21-12 <f>ⓩ</f> Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people. It is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. <f>ⓐ</f>Strike therefore upon your thigh.
Ezekiel 21-13 For it will not be a testing — what could it do if you despise <f>ⓑ</f>the rod?” <f>[4]</f> declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 21-14 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓒ</f>son of man, prophesy. <f>ⓓ</f>Clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, <f>ⓔ</f>yes, three times, <f>[5]</f> the sword for those to be slain. It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them,
Ezekiel 21-15 that their hearts may melt, and many stumble. <f>[6]</f> At all their gates I have given the glittering sword. Ah, it is made like lightning; <f>ⓕ</f>it is taken up <f>[7]</f> for slaughter.
Ezekiel 21-16 Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your face is directed.
Ezekiel 21-17 I also will <f>ⓖ</f>clap my hands, <f>ⓗ</f>and I will satisfy my fury; <f>ⓘ</f>I the LORD have spoken.”
Ezekiel 21-18 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me again:
Ezekiel 21-19 “As for you, son of man, mark two ways for <f>ⓙ</f>the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same land. And make <f>ⓚ</f>a signpost; make it <f>ⓛ</f>at the head of the way to a city.
Ezekiel 21-20 Mark a way <f>ⓜ</f>for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, into Jerusalem the fortified.
Ezekiel 21-21 For the king of Babylon stands <f>ⓝ</f>at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows; he consults <f>ⓞ</f>the teraphim; <f>[8]</f> he looks at the liver.
Ezekiel 21-22 Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem, <f>ⓟ</f>to set battering rams, to open the mouth with murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, <f>ⓠ</f>to cast up mounds, to build siege towers.
Ezekiel 21-23 But to them it will seem like a false divination. <f>ⓡ</f>They have sworn solemn oaths, but he brings their guilt to remembrance, <f>ⓢ</f>that they may be taken.
Ezekiel 21-24 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear — because you have come to remembrance, <f>ⓣ</f>you shall be taken in hand.
Ezekiel 21-25 And you, O profane <f>[9]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>wicked one, prince of Israel, <f>ⓥ</f>whose day has come, <f>ⓦ</f>the time of your final punishment,
Ezekiel 21-26 thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. <f>ⓧ</f>Exalt that which is low, and bring low that which is exalted.
Ezekiel 21-27 A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it. <f>ⓨ</f>This also shall not be, <f>ⓩ</f>until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.
Ezekiel 21-28 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD <f>ⓑ</f>concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; say, <f>ⓒ</f>A sword, a sword <f>ⓓ</f>is drawn for the slaughter. <f>ⓔ</f>It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning —
Ezekiel 21-29 while <f>ⓕ</f>they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you — to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, <f>ⓖ</f>whose day has come, the time of their final punishment.
Ezekiel 21-30 <f>ⓗ</f> Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, <f>ⓘ</f>I will judge you.
Ezekiel 21-31 And <f>ⓙ</f>I will pour out my indignation upon you; <f>ⓚ</f>I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of <f>ⓛ</f>brutish men, skillful to destroy.
Ezekiel 21-32 You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. <f>ⓜ</f>You shall be no more remembered, <f>ⓝ</f>for I the LORD have spoken.”
