Jeremiah 41-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at <f>ⓑ</f>Mizpah. As they <f>ⓒ</f>ate bread together there at Mizpah,
Jeremiah 41-2 <f>ⓓ</f> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, <f>ⓔ</f>whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land.
Jeremiah 41-3 Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at <f>ⓕ</f>Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.
Jeremiah 41-4 <pb/>On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,
Jeremiah 41-5 eighty men arrived from <f>ⓖ</f>Shechem and <f>ⓗ</f>Shiloh and <f>ⓘ</f>Samaria, with <f>ⓙ</f>their beards shaved and <f>ⓚ</f>their clothes torn, and <f>ⓛ</f>their bodies gashed, <f>ⓜ</f>bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD.
Jeremiah 41-6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from <f>ⓝ</f>Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”
Jeremiah 41-7 When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern.
Jeremiah 41-8 But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death, for we have <f>ⓞ</f>stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.
Jeremiah 41-9 <pb/>Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with <f>[1]</f> Gedaliah was the large cistern that <f>ⓟ</f>King Asa had made for defense against <f>ⓠ</f>Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
Jeremiah 41-10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, <f>ⓡ</f>the king's daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom <f>ⓢ</f>Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to <f>ⓣ</f>the Ammonites.
Jeremiah 41-11 <pb/>But when <f>ⓤ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓥ</f>all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
Jeremiah 41-12 they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at <f>ⓦ</f>the great pool that is in <f>ⓧ</f>Gibeon.
Jeremiah 41-13 And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓨ</f>all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced.
Jeremiah 41-14 <f>ⓩ</f> So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
Jeremiah 41-15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to <f>ⓐ</f>the Ammonites.
Jeremiah 41-16 Then Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓑ</f>all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam — soldiers, <f>ⓒ</f>women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from <f>ⓓ</f>Gibeon.
Jeremiah 41-17 And they went and stayed at Geruth <f>ⓔ</f>Chimham near <f>ⓕ</f>Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt
Jeremiah 41-18 because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, <f>ⓖ</f>whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
