1 Samuel 21-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> Then David came to <f>ⓐ</f>Nob, to <f>ⓑ</f>Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech <f>ⓒ</f>came to meet David, trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?”
1 Samuel 21-2 And David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, ‘Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.’ I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.
1 Samuel 21-3 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.”
1 Samuel 21-4 And the priest answered David, “I have no common bread on hand, but there is <f>ⓓ</f>holy bread — <f>ⓔ</f>if the young men have kept themselves from women.”
1 Samuel 21-5 And David answered the priest, “Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?”
1 Samuel 21-6 So the priest gave him <f>ⓕ</f>the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, <f>ⓖ</f>which is removed from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.
1 Samuel 21-7 <pb/>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD. His name was <f>ⓗ</f>Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.
1 Samuel 21-8 <pb/>Then David said to Ahimelech, “Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.”
1 Samuel 21-9 And the priest said, <f>ⓘ</f>“The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in <f>ⓙ</f>the Valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here.” And David said, “There is none like that; give it to me.”
1 Samuel 21-10 <pb/>And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to <f>ⓚ</f>Achish the king of Gath.
1 Samuel 21-11 And the servants of Achish said to him, “Is not this David the king of the land? <f>ⓛ</f>Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, <pb/><t>‘Saul has struck down his thousands, </t><t>and David his ten thousands’?” </t>
1 Samuel 21-12 <pb/>And David <f>ⓜ</f>took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
1 Samuel 21-13 So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard.
1 Samuel 21-14 Then Achish said to his servants, “Behold, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?
1 Samuel 21-15 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?”
