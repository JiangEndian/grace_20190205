Genesis 50-1 <pb/>Then Joseph <f>ⓐ</f>fell on his father's face and wept over him and kissed him.
Genesis 50-2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to <f>ⓑ</f>embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis 50-3 Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians <f>ⓒ</f>wept for him seventy days.
Genesis 50-4 <pb/>And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, <f>ⓓ</f>“If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
Genesis 50-5 ‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die: in my tomb <f>ⓔ</f>that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.” Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.’”
Genesis 50-6 And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.”
Genesis 50-7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
Genesis 50-8 as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left <f>ⓕ</f>in the land of Goshen.
Genesis 50-9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
Genesis 50-10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, <f>ⓖ</f>they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he <f>ⓗ</f>made a mourning for his father seven days.
Genesis 50-11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; <f>[1]</f> it is beyond the Jordan.
Genesis 50-12 Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them,
Genesis 50-13 for <f>ⓘ</f>his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham <f>ⓙ</f>bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place.
Genesis 50-14 After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
Genesis 50-15 <pb/>When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.”
Genesis 50-16 So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died:
Genesis 50-17 ‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of <f>ⓚ</f>the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
Genesis 50-18 His brothers also came and <f>ⓛ</f>fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.”
Genesis 50-19 But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for <f>ⓜ</f>am I in the place of God?
Genesis 50-20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but <f>ⓝ</f>God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people <f>[2]</f> should be kept alive, as they are today.
Genesis 50-21 So do not fear; <f>ⓞ</f>I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
Genesis 50-22 <pb/>So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father's house. Joseph lived 110 years.
Genesis 50-23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children <f>ⓟ</f>of the third generation. The <f>ⓠ</f>children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were <f>ⓡ</f>counted as Joseph's own. <f>[3]</f>
Genesis 50-24 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but <f>ⓢ</f>God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land <f>ⓣ</f>that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
Genesis 50-25 Then <f>ⓤ</f>Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”
Genesis 50-26 So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They <f>ⓥ</f>embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
