1 Peter 5-1 <pb/>So I exhort the elders among you, <f>ⓐ</f>as a fellow elder and <f>ⓑ</f>a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:
1 Peter 5-2 <f>ⓒ</f> shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
1 Peter 5-3 not <f>ⓕ</f>domineering over those in your charge, but <f>ⓖ</f>being examples to the flock.
1 Peter 5-4 And when <f>ⓗ</f>the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the <f>ⓘ</f>unfading <f>ⓙ</f>crown of glory.
1 Peter 5-5 Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. <f>ⓚ</f>Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for <f>ⓛ</f>“God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”
1 Peter 5-6 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,
1 Peter 5-7 <f>ⓝ</f> casting all your anxieties on him, because <f>ⓞ</f>he cares for you.
1 Peter 5-8 <f>ⓟ</f> Be sober-minded; <f>ⓠ</f>be watchful. Your <f>ⓡ</f>adversary the devil <f>ⓢ</f>prowls around <f>ⓣ</f>like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
1 Peter 5-9 <f>ⓤ</f> Resist him, <f>ⓥ</f>firm in your faith, knowing that <f>ⓦ</f>the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.
1 Peter 5-10 And <f>ⓧ</f>after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, <f>ⓨ</f>who has called you to his <f>ⓩ</f>eternal glory in Christ, will himself <f>ⓐ</f>restore, <f>ⓑ</f>confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
1 Peter 5-11 <f>ⓒ</f> To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter 5-12 <pb/>By <f>ⓓ</f>Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, <f>ⓔ</f>I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is <f>ⓕ</f>the true grace of God. <f>ⓖ</f>Stand firm in it.
1 Peter 5-13 She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does <f>ⓗ</f>Mark, my son.
1 Peter 5-14 <f>ⓘ</f> Greet one another with the kiss of love. <pb/><f>ⓙ</f>Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
