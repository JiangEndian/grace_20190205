1 Samuel 16-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Samuel, <f>ⓐ</f>“How long will you grieve over Saul, since <f>ⓑ</f>I have rejected him from being king over Israel? <f>ⓒ</f>Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, <f>ⓓ</f>for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”
1 Samuel 16-2 And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” And the LORD said, “Take a heifer with you and say, <f>ⓔ</f>‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’
1 Samuel 16-3 And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. <f>ⓕ</f>And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you.”
1 Samuel 16-4 Samuel did what the LORD commanded and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city <f>ⓖ</f>came to meet him trembling and said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Do you come peaceably?”
1 Samuel 16-5 And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. <f>ⓘ</f>Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
1 Samuel 16-6 <pb/>When they came, he looked on <f>ⓙ</f>Eliab and thought, “Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.”
1 Samuel 16-7 But the LORD said to Samuel, <f>ⓚ</f>“Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, <f>ⓛ</f>but the LORD looks on the heart.”
1 Samuel 16-8 Then Jesse called <f>ⓜ</f>Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.”
1 Samuel 16-9 Then Jesse made <f>ⓝ</f>Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the LORD chosen this one.”
1 Samuel 16-10 And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen these.”
1 Samuel 16-11 Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” And he said, <f>ⓞ</f>“There remains yet the youngest, <f>[1]</f> but behold, he is keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, <f>ⓟ</f>“Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.”
1 Samuel 16-12 And he sent and brought him in. Now he was <f>ⓠ</f>ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the LORD said, <f>ⓡ</f>“Arise, anoint him, for this is he.”
1 Samuel 16-13 Then Samuel took <f>ⓢ</f>the horn of oil <f>ⓣ</f>and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. <f>ⓤ</f>And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.
1 Samuel 16-14 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, <f>ⓦ</f>and a harmful spirit from the LORD tormented him.
1 Samuel 16-15 And Saul's servants said to him, “Behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you.
1 Samuel 16-16 Let our lord now command your servants <f>ⓧ</f>who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre, and when the harmful spirit from God is upon you, he will <f>ⓨ</f>play it, and you will be well.”
1 Samuel 16-17 So Saul said to his servants, “Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me.”
1 Samuel 16-18 One of the young men answered, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, <f>ⓩ</f>a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence, <f>ⓐ</f>and the LORD is with him.”
1 Samuel 16-19 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son, <f>ⓑ</f>who is with the sheep.”
1 Samuel 16-20 <f>ⓒ</f> And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul.
1 Samuel 16-21 And David came to Saul <f>ⓓ</f>and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
1 Samuel 16-22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.”
1 Samuel 16-23 And <f>ⓔ</f>whenever the harmful spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre <f>ⓕ</f>and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the harmful spirit departed from him.
