Numbers 24-1 <pb/>When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go, as at <f>ⓐ</f>other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness.
Numbers 24-2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel <f>ⓑ</f>camping tribe by tribe. And <f>ⓒ</f>the Spirit of God came upon him,
Numbers 24-3 and he <f>ⓓ</f>took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, </t><t>the oracle of the man whose eye is opened, <f>[1]</f></t>
Numbers 24-4 <t>the oracle of him who hears the words of God, </t><t>who sees the vision of the Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>falling down with his eyes uncovered:</t>
Numbers 24-5 <t>How lovely are your tents, O Jacob, </t><t>your encampments, O Israel!</t>
Numbers 24-6 <t>Like palm groves <f>[2]</f> that stretch afar, </t><t>like gardens beside a river, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>like aloes <f>ⓖ</f>that the LORD has planted, </t><t>like cedar trees beside the waters.</t>
Numbers 24-7 <t>Water shall flow from his buckets, </t><t>and his seed shall be <f>ⓗ</f>in many waters; </t><t>his king shall be higher than <f>ⓘ</f>Agag, </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>his kingdom shall be exalted.</t>
Numbers 24-8 <t>God brings him out of Egypt </t><t>and is for him like the <f>ⓚ</f>horns of the wild ox; </t><t>he shall <f>ⓛ</f>eat up the nations, his adversaries, </t><t>and shall <f>ⓜ</f>break their bones in pieces </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>pierce them through with his arrows.</t>
Numbers 24-9 <t>He crouched, he lay down like a lion </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>like a lioness; who will rouse him up? </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>Blessed are those who bless you, </t><t>and cursed are those who curse you.” </t>
Numbers 24-10 <pb/>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he <f>ⓠ</f>struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, <f>ⓡ</f>“I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times.
Numbers 24-11 Therefore now flee to your own place. I said, <f>ⓢ</f>‘I will certainly honor you,’ but the LORD has held you back from honor.”
Numbers 24-12 And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,
Numbers 24-13 <f>ⓣ</f> ‘If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the LORD, to do either good or bad <f>ⓤ</f>of my own will. What the LORD speaks, that will I speak’?
Numbers 24-14 And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, <f>ⓥ</f>I will let you know what this people will do to your people <f>ⓦ</f>in the latter days.”
Numbers 24-15 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> And he took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor, </t><t>the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,</t>
Numbers 24-16 <t>the oracle of him who hears the words of God, </t><t>and knows the knowledge of <f>ⓨ</f>the Most High, </t><t>who sees the vision of the Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>falling down with his eyes uncovered:</t>
Numbers 24-17 <t><f>ⓐ</f> I see him, but not now; </t><t>I behold him, but not near: </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>a star shall come out of Jacob, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>a scepter shall rise out of Israel; </t><t>it shall <f>ⓓ</f>crush the forehead <f>[3]</f> of Moab </t><t>and break down all the sons of Sheth.</t>
Numbers 24-18 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Edom shall be dispossessed; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>Seir also, his enemies, shall be dispossessed. </t><t>Israel is doing valiantly.</t>
Numbers 24-19 <t>And one from Jacob shall exercise dominion </t><t>and destroy the survivors of cities!” </t>
Numbers 24-20 <pb/>Then he looked on Amalek and <f>ⓖ</f>took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“Amalek was the first among the nations, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>but its end is utter destruction.” </t>
Numbers 24-21 <pb/>And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“Enduring is your dwelling place, </t><t>and your nest is set in the rock.</t>
Numbers 24-22 <t>Nevertheless, Kain shall be burned </t><t>when Asshur takes you away captive.” </t>
Numbers 24-23 <pb/>And he took up his discourse and said, <pb/><t>“Alas, who shall live when God does this?</t>
Numbers 24-24 <t>But ships shall come from <f>ⓘ</f>Kittim </t><t>and shall afflict Asshur and <f>ⓙ</f>Eber; </t><t>and he too <f>ⓚ</f>shall come to utter destruction.” </t>
Numbers 24-25 <pb/>Then Balaam rose and <f>ⓛ</f>went back to his place. And Balak also went his way.
