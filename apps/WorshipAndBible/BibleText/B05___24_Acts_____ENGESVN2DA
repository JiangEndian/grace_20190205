Acts 24-1 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>after five days the high priest <f>ⓑ</f>Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before <f>ⓒ</f>the governor their case against Paul.
Acts 24-2 And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: <pb/>“Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, <f>ⓓ</f>most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation,
Acts 24-3 in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude.
Acts 24-4 But, to detain <f>[1]</f> you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.
Acts 24-5 For we have found this man a plague, <f>ⓔ</f>one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of <f>ⓕ</f>the sect of the Nazarenes.
Acts 24-6 <f>ⓖ</f> He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. <f>[2]</f>
Acts 24-7 
Acts 24-8 By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him.”
Acts 24-9 <pb/>The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.
Acts 24-10 <pb/>And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied: <pb/>“Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.
Acts 24-11 You can verify that <f>ⓗ</f>it is not more than twelve days since I <f>ⓘ</f>went up <f>ⓙ</f>to worship in Jerusalem,
Acts 24-12 and <f>ⓚ</f>they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city.
Acts 24-13 <f>ⓛ</f> Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me.
Acts 24-14 But this I confess to you, that according to <f>ⓜ</f>the Way, which they call <f>ⓝ</f>a sect, <f>ⓞ</f>I worship <f>ⓟ</f>the God of our fathers, believing everything <f>ⓠ</f>laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,
Acts 24-15 <f>ⓡ</f> having <f>ⓢ</f>a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be <f>ⓣ</f>a resurrection <f>ⓤ</f>of both the just and the unjust.
Acts 24-16 So I always <f>ⓥ</f>take pains to have a <f>ⓦ</f>clear conscience toward both God and man.
Acts 24-17 Now <f>ⓧ</f>after several years <f>ⓨ</f>I came to bring alms to <f>ⓩ</f>my nation and to present <f>ⓐ</f>offerings.
Acts 24-18 While I was doing this, they found me <f>ⓑ</f>purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But <f>ⓒ</f>some Jews from Asia —
Acts 24-19 <f>ⓓ</f> they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me.
Acts 24-20 Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council,
Acts 24-21 other than this one thing <f>ⓔ</f>that I cried out while standing among them: ‘It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.’”
Acts 24-22 <pb/>But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of <f>ⓕ</f>the Way, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.”
Acts 24-23 Then he gave orders to the centurion that he <f>ⓖ</f>should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that <f>ⓗ</f>none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.
Acts 24-24 <pb/>After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about <f>ⓘ</f>faith <f>ⓙ</f>in Christ Jesus.
Acts 24-25 And as he reasoned <f>ⓚ</f>about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, “Go away for the present. <f>ⓛ</f>When I get an opportunity I will summon you.”
Acts 24-26 At the same time he hoped <f>ⓜ</f>that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.
Acts 24-27 When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius <f>ⓝ</f>Festus. And <f>ⓞ</f>desiring to do the Jews a favor, <f>ⓟ</f>Felix left Paul in prison.
