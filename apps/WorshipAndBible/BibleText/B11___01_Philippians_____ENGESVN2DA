Philippians 1-1 <pb/>Paul and Timothy, servants <f>[1]</f> of Christ Jesus, <pb/>To all the <f>ⓐ</f>saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the <f>ⓑ</f>overseers <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓒ</f>deacons: <f>[3]</f>
Philippians 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> I thank my God <f>ⓕ</f>in all my remembrance of you,
Philippians 1-4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy,
Philippians 1-5 <f>ⓖ</f> because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
Philippians 1-6 And I am sure of this, that he who began <f>ⓗ</f>a good work in you <f>ⓘ</f>will bring it to completion at <f>ⓙ</f>the day of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1-7 It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you <f>ⓚ</f>in my heart, for you are all <f>ⓛ</f>partakers with me of grace, <f>[4]</f> both <f>ⓜ</f>in my imprisonment and in <f>ⓝ</f>the defense and confirmation of the gospel.
Philippians 1-8 For <f>ⓞ</f>God is my witness, <f>ⓟ</f>how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
Philippians 1-9 And it is my prayer that <f>ⓠ</f>your love may abound more and more, <f>ⓡ</f>with knowledge and all discernment,
Philippians 1-10 so that you may approve what is excellent, <f>ⓢ</f>and so be pure and blameless <f>ⓣ</f>for the day of Christ,
Philippians 1-11 filled <f>ⓤ</f>with the fruit of righteousness that comes <f>ⓥ</f>through Jesus Christ, <f>ⓦ</f>to the glory and praise of God.
Philippians 1-12 <pb/>I want you to know, brothers, <f>[5]</f> that what has happened to me has really <f>ⓧ</f>served to advance the gospel,
Philippians 1-13 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard <f>[6]</f> and <f>ⓨ</f>to all the rest that <f>ⓩ</f>my imprisonment is for Christ.
Philippians 1-14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold <f>ⓐ</f>to speak the word <f>[7]</f> without fear.
Philippians 1-15 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will.
Philippians 1-16 The latter do it out of love, <f>ⓒ</f>knowing that I am put here for <f>ⓓ</f>the defense of the gospel.
Philippians 1-17 The former proclaim Christ <f>ⓔ</f>out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.
Philippians 1-18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. <pb/><e>To Live Is Christ</e> </pb> <pb/>Yes, and I will rejoice,
Philippians 1-19 for I know that <f>ⓕ</f>through your prayers and <f>ⓖ</f>the help of <f>ⓗ</f>the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,
Philippians 1-20 as it is my eager expectation and hope <f>ⓘ</f>that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full <f>ⓙ</f>courage now as always Christ <f>ⓚ</f>will be honored in my body, <f>ⓛ</f>whether by life or by death.
Philippians 1-21 For to me <f>ⓜ</f>to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
Philippians 1-22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
Philippians 1-23 <f>ⓝ</f> I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is <f>ⓞ</f>to depart and <f>ⓟ</f>be with Christ, for that is far better.
Philippians 1-24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
Philippians 1-25 <f>ⓠ</f> Convinced of this, <f>ⓡ</f>I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your <f>ⓢ</f>progress and <f>ⓣ</f>joy in the faith,
Philippians 1-26 so that in me <f>ⓤ</f>you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.
Philippians 1-27 <pb/>Only <f>ⓥ</f>let your manner of life be <f>ⓦ</f>worthy <f>[8]</f> of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you <f>ⓧ</f>that you are standing firm in one spirit, with <f>ⓨ</f>one mind <f>ⓩ</f>striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,
Philippians 1-28 and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is <f>ⓐ</f>a clear sign to them of their destruction, but <f>ⓑ</f>of your salvation, and that from God.
Philippians 1-29 For <f>ⓒ</f>it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also <f>ⓓ</f>suffer for his sake,
Philippians 1-30 engaged in the same <f>ⓔ</f>conflict that <f>ⓕ</f>you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
