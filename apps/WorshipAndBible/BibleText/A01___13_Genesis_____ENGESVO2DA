Genesis 13-1 <pb/>So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, <f>ⓐ</f>into the Negeb.
Genesis 13-2 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis 13-3 And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
Genesis 13-4 to <f>ⓒ</f>the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.
Genesis 13-5 And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
Genesis 13-6 so that <f>ⓓ</f>the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together,
Genesis 13-7 <f>ⓔ</f> and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time <f>ⓕ</f>the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.
Genesis 13-8 <pb/>Then Abram said to Lot, <f>ⓖ</f>“Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, <f>ⓗ</f>for we are kinsmen. <f>[1]</f>
Genesis 13-9 <f>ⓘ</f> Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
Genesis 13-10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the <f>ⓙ</f>Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like <f>ⓚ</f>the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of <f>ⓛ</f>Zoar. (This was before the LORD <f>ⓜ</f>destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
Genesis 13-11 So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.
Genesis 13-12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
Genesis 13-13 Now the men of Sodom <f>ⓝ</f>were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.
Genesis 13-14 <pb/>The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, <f>ⓞ</f>northward and southward and eastward and westward,
Genesis 13-15 for all the land that you see I will give <f>ⓟ</f>to you and <f>ⓠ</f>to your offspring forever.
Genesis 13-16 <f>ⓡ</f> I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
Genesis 13-17 Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.”
Genesis 13-18 So Abram moved his tent and came and <f>ⓢ</f>settled by the <f>ⓣ</f>oaks <f>[2]</f> of Mamre, which <f>ⓤ</f>are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.
