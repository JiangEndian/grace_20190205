Genesis 2-1 <pb/>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and <f>ⓐ</f>all the host of them.
Genesis 2-2 And <f>ⓑ</f>on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
Genesis 2-3 So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
Genesis 2-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> These are the generations </t><t>of the heavens and the earth when they were created, </t><t>in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens. </t>
Genesis 2-5 <pb/>When no <f>ⓓ</f>bush of the field <f>[1]</f> was yet in the land <f>[2]</f> and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up — for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man <f>ⓔ</f>to work the ground,
Genesis 2-6 and a mist <f>[3]</f> was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground —
Genesis 2-7 then the LORD God formed the man of <f>ⓕ</f>dust from the ground and <f>ⓖ</f>breathed into his <f>ⓗ</f>nostrils the breath of life, and <f>ⓘ</f>the man became a living creature.
Genesis 2-8 And the LORD God planted a <f>ⓙ</f>garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Genesis 2-9 And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. <f>ⓚ</f>The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, <f>ⓛ</f>and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis 2-10 <pb/>A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.
Genesis 2-11 The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of <f>ⓜ</f>Havilah, where there is gold.
Genesis 2-12 And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
Genesis 2-13 The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.
Genesis 2-14 And the name of the third river is the <f>ⓝ</f>Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis 2-15 <pb/>The LORD God took the man <f>ⓞ</f>and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
Genesis 2-16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
Genesis 2-17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil <f>ⓟ</f>you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat <f>[4]</f> of it you <f>ⓠ</f>shall surely die.”
Genesis 2-18 <pb/>Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; <f>ⓡ</f>I will make him a helper fit for <f>[5]</f> him.”
Genesis 2-19 <f>ⓢ</f> Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed <f>[6]</f> every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and <f>ⓣ</f>brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
Genesis 2-20 The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam <f>[7]</f> there was not found a helper fit for him.
Genesis 2-21 So the LORD God caused a <f>ⓤ</f>deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
Genesis 2-22 And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made <f>[8]</f> into a woman and brought her to the man.
Genesis 2-23 Then the man said, <pb/><t>“This at last is <f>ⓥ</f>bone of my bones </t><t>and flesh of my flesh; </t><t>she shall be called Woman, </t><t>because she was <f>ⓦ</f>taken out of Man.” <f>[9]</f> </t>
Genesis 2-24 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
Genesis 2-25 And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
