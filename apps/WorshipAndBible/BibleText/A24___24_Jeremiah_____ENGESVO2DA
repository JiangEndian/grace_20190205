Jeremiah 24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem <f>ⓑ</f>Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with <f>ⓒ</f>the officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers, and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me this vision: behold, <f>ⓓ</f>two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the LORD.
Jeremiah 24-2 One basket had very good figs, <f>ⓔ</f>like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had <f>ⓕ</f>very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.
Jeremiah 24-3 And the LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”
Jeremiah 24-4 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah 24-5 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, <f>ⓖ</f>whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah 24-6 <f>ⓗ</f> I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. <f>ⓘ</f>I will build them up, and not tear them down; <f>ⓙ</f>I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
Jeremiah 24-7 <f>ⓚ</f> I will give them a heart to know that I am the LORD, <f>ⓛ</f>and they shall be my people <f>ⓜ</f>and I will be their God, <f>ⓝ</f>for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
Jeremiah 24-8 <pb/>“But thus says the LORD: Like <f>ⓞ</f>the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat <f>ⓟ</f>Zedekiah the king of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who <f>ⓠ</f>dwell in the land of Egypt.
Jeremiah 24-9 I will make them <f>ⓡ</f>a horror <f>[1]</f> to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be <f>ⓢ</f>a reproach, <f>ⓣ</f>a byword, <f>ⓤ</f>a taunt, and <f>ⓥ</f>a curse in all the places where I shall drive them.
Jeremiah 24-10 And I will send <f>ⓦ</f>sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall be utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.”
