Ecclesiastes 8-1 <pb/><t>Who is like the wise? </t><t>And who knows the interpretation of a thing? </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>A man's wisdom makes his face shine, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>the hardness of his face is changed. </t>
Ecclesiastes 8-2 <pb/>I say: <f>[1]</f> Keep the king's command, because of <f>ⓒ</f>God's oath to him. <f>[2]</f>
Ecclesiastes 8-3 Be not hasty to <f>ⓓ</f>go from his presence. Do not take your stand in an evil cause, for he does whatever he pleases.
Ecclesiastes 8-4 For the word of the king is supreme, and <f>ⓔ</f>who may say to him, “What are you doing?”
Ecclesiastes 8-5 Whoever keeps a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the proper time and the just way. <f>[3]</f>
Ecclesiastes 8-6 For there is a time and a way <f>ⓕ</f>for everything, although man's trouble <f>[4]</f> lies heavy on him.
Ecclesiastes 8-7 For he <f>ⓖ</f>does not know what is to be, for <f>ⓗ</f>who can tell him how it will be?
Ecclesiastes 8-8 No man has power to <f>ⓘ</f>retain the spirit, <f>ⓙ</f>or power over the day of death. There is no <f>ⓚ</f>discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.
Ecclesiastes 8-9 <f>ⓛ</f> All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes 8-10 <pb/>Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of <f>ⓜ</f>the holy place and were <f>ⓝ</f>praised <f>[5]</f> in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity. <f>[6]</f>
Ecclesiastes 8-11 Because <f>ⓞ</f>the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, <f>ⓟ</f>the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil.
Ecclesiastes 8-12 Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and <f>ⓠ</f>prolongs his life, yet I know that <f>ⓡ</f>it will be well with <f>ⓢ</f>those who fear God, because they fear before him.
Ecclesiastes 8-13 But it will <f>ⓣ</f>not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like <f>ⓤ</f>a shadow, because he does not fear before God.
Ecclesiastes 8-14 <pb/>There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people <f>ⓥ</f>to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people <f>ⓦ</f>to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 8-15 And I commend joy, for man <f>ⓧ</f>has nothing better under the sun but to <f>ⓨ</f>eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 8-16 <pb/>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see <f>ⓩ</f>the business that is done on earth, how neither <f>ⓐ</f>day nor night do one's eyes see sleep,
Ecclesiastes 8-17 then I saw all the work of God, that <f>ⓑ</f>man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, <f>ⓒ</f>he cannot find it out.
