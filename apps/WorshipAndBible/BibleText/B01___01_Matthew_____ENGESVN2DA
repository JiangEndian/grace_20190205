Matthew 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, <f>ⓑ</f>the son of David, <f>ⓒ</f>the son of Abraham.
Matthew 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Abraham was the father of Isaac, and <f>ⓔ</f>Isaac the father of Jacob, and <f>ⓕ</f>Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
Matthew 1-3 and <f>ⓖ</f>Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram, <f>[1]</f>

Matthew 1-5 and Salmon the father of Boaz by <f>ⓗ</f>Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,
Matthew 1-6 and <f>ⓘ</f>Jesse the father of David the king. <pb/>And <f>ⓙ</f>David was the father of Solomon by <f>ⓚ</f>the wife of Uriah,
Matthew 1-7 and <f>ⓛ</f>Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, <f>[2]</f>
Matthew 1-8 and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, <f>ⓜ</f>and Joram the father of Uzziah,
Matthew 1-9 and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
Matthew 1-10 and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, <f>[3]</f> and Amos the father of Josiah,
Matthew 1-11 and <f>ⓝ</f>Josiah the father of <f>ⓞ</f>Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
Matthew 1-12 <pb/>And after the deportation to Babylon: <f>ⓟ</f>Jechoniah was the father of <f>ⓠ</f>Shealtiel, <f>[4]</f> and <f>ⓡ</f>Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,

Matthew 1-18 <pb/>Now the birth of <f>ⓤ</f>Jesus Christ <f>[5]</f> took place in this way. <f>ⓥ</f>When his mother Mary had been betrothed <f>[6]</f> to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child <f>ⓦ</f>from the Holy Spirit.
Matthew 1-19 And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling <f>ⓧ</f>to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.
Matthew 1-20 But as he considered these things, behold, <f>ⓨ</f>an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
Matthew 1-21 She will bear a son, and <f>ⓩ</f>you shall call his name Jesus, <f>ⓐ</f>for he will save his people from their sins.”
Matthew 1-22 <f>ⓑ</f> All this took place <f>ⓒ</f>to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
Matthew 1-23 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, </t><t>and they shall call his name <f>ⓔ</f>Immanuel” </t> <pb/>(which means, God <f>ⓕ</f>with us).
Matthew 1-24 When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife,
Matthew 1-25 but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And <f>ⓖ</f>he called his name Jesus.
