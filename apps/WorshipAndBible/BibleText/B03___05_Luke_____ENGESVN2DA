Luke 5-1 <pb/>On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by <f>ⓐ</f>the lake of Gennesaret,
Luke 5-2 <f>ⓑ</f> and he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were <f>ⓒ</f>washing their nets.
Luke 5-3 Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And <f>ⓓ</f>he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
Luke 5-4 And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”</J>
Luke 5-5 And Simon answered, “Master, <f>ⓕ</f>we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.”
Luke 5-6 And when they had done this, <f>ⓖ</f>they enclosed a large number of fish, and <f>ⓗ</f>their nets were breaking.
Luke 5-7 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. <f>ⓘ</f>And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
Luke 5-8 But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>“Depart from me, for <f>ⓚ</f>I am a sinful man, O Lord.”
Luke 5-9 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,
Luke 5-10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <J>“Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.” <f>[1]</f></J>
Luke 5-11 And when they had brought their boats to land, <f>ⓛ</f>they left everything and followed him.
Luke 5-12 <pb/>While he was in one of the cities, <f>ⓜ</f>there came a man full of leprosy. <f>[2]</f> And when he saw Jesus, he <f>ⓝ</f>fell on his face and begged him, “Lord, <f>ⓞ</f>if you will, you can make me clean.”
Luke 5-13 And Jesus <f>[3]</f> stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <J>“I will; be clean.”</J> And immediately the leprosy left him.
Luke 5-14 And he charged him <f>ⓟ</f>to tell no one, but <J>“go and show <f>ⓠ</f>yourself to the priest, and <f>ⓡ</f>make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, <f>ⓢ</f>for a proof to them.”</J>
Luke 5-15 <f>ⓣ</f> But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities.
Luke 5-16 But <f>ⓤ</f>he would withdraw to desolate places and <f>ⓥ</f>pray.
Luke 5-17 <pb/>On one of those days, as he was teaching, Pharisees and <f>ⓦ</f>teachers of the law were sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And <f>ⓧ</f>the power of the Lord was with him to heal. <f>[4]</f>
Luke 5-18 <f>ⓨ</f> And behold, some men were bringing <f>ⓩ</f>on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and lay him before Jesus,
Luke 5-19 but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on <f>ⓐ</f>the roof and let him down with his bed <f>ⓑ</f>through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.
Luke 5-20 And <f>ⓒ</f>when he saw their faith, he said, <J>“Man, <f>ⓓ</f>your sins are forgiven you.”</J>
Luke 5-21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, “Who is this who speaks <f>ⓔ</f>blasphemies? <f>ⓕ</f>Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
Luke 5-22 When Jesus <f>ⓖ</f>perceived their thoughts, he answered them, <J>“Why do you question in your hearts?</J>
Luke 5-23 <J>Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?</J>
Luke 5-24 <J>But that you may know that <f>ⓗ</f>the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</J> — he said to the man who was paralyzed — <J>“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed and go home.”</J>
Luke 5-25 And immediately he rose up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went home, <f>ⓘ</f>glorifying God.
Luke 5-26 And amazement seized them all, and they <f>ⓙ</f>glorified God and were filled <f>ⓚ</f>with awe, saying, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”
Luke 5-27 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> After this he went out and saw <f>ⓜ</f>a tax collector named <f>ⓝ</f>Levi, sitting at the tax booth. And he said to him, <J>“Follow me.”</J>
Luke 5-28 And <f>ⓞ</f>leaving everything, he rose and followed him.
Luke 5-29 <pb/>And Levi made him a great feast in his house, and there was a large company <f>ⓟ</f>of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them.
Luke 5-30 And the Pharisees and <f>ⓠ</f>their scribes grumbled at his disciples, saying, <f>ⓡ</f>“Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
Luke 5-31 And Jesus answered them, <J>“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</J>
Luke 5-32 <J><f>ⓢ</f> I have not come to call the righteous <f>ⓣ</f>but sinners <f>ⓤ</f>to repentance.”</J>
Luke 5-33 <pb/>And they said to him, <f>ⓥ</f>“The disciples of John <f>ⓦ</f>fast often and <f>ⓧ</f>offer prayers, <f>ⓨ</f>and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.”
Luke 5-34 And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓩ</f>“Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?</J>
Luke 5-35 <J><f>ⓐ</f> The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and <f>ⓑ</f>then they will fast in those days.”</J>
Luke 5-36 He also told them a parable: <J>“No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. If he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</J>
Luke 5-37 <J>And no one puts new wine into old <f>ⓒ</f>wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.</J>
Luke 5-38 <J>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</J>
Luke 5-39 <J>And no one after drinking old wine desires new, for he says, ‘The old is good.’” <f>[5]</f></J>
