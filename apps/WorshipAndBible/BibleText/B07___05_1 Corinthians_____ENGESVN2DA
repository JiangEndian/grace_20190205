1 Corinthians 5-1 <pb/>It is actually reported that there is <f>ⓐ</f>sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, <f>ⓑ</f>for a man has his father's wife.
1 Corinthians 5-2 And <f>ⓒ</f>you are arrogant! Ought you <f>ⓓ</f>not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
1 Corinthians 5-3 <pb/>For though <f>ⓔ</f>absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing.
1 Corinthians 5-4 When you are assembled <f>ⓕ</f>in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
1 Corinthians 5-5 you are <f>ⓖ</f>to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so <f>ⓗ</f>that his spirit may be saved <f>ⓘ</f>in the day of the Lord. <f>[1]</f>
1 Corinthians 5-6 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that <f>ⓚ</f>a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
1 Corinthians 5-7 Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
1 Corinthians 5-8 Let us therefore celebrate the festival, <f>ⓛ</f>not with the old leaven, <f>ⓜ</f>the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1 Corinthians 5-9 <pb/>I wrote to you in my letter <f>ⓝ</f>not to associate with sexually immoral people —
1 Corinthians 5-10 <f>ⓞ</f> not at all meaning <f>ⓟ</f>the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, <f>ⓠ</f>since then you would need to go out of the world.
1 Corinthians 5-11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone <f>ⓡ</f>who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler — not even to eat with such a one.
1 Corinthians 5-12 For what have I to do with judging <f>ⓢ</f>outsiders? <f>ⓣ</f>Is it not those inside the church <f>[2]</f> whom you are to judge?
1 Corinthians 5-13 God judges <f>[3]</f> those outside. <f>ⓤ</f>“Purge the evil person from among you.”
