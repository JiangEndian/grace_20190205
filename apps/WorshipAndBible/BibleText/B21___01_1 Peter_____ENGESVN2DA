1 Peter 1-1 <pb/>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, <pb/>To those who are elect exiles of <f>ⓐ</f>the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
1 Peter 1-2 according to <f>ⓑ</f>the foreknowledge of God the Father, <f>ⓒ</f>in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and <f>ⓓ</f>for sprinkling with his blood: <pb/>May <f>ⓔ</f>grace and <f>ⓕ</f>peace be multiplied to you.
1 Peter 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! <f>ⓗ</f>According to his great mercy, <f>ⓘ</f>he has caused us to be born again to a living hope <f>ⓙ</f>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
1 Peter 1-4 to <f>ⓚ</f>an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and <f>ⓛ</f>unfading, <f>ⓜ</f>kept in heaven for you,
1 Peter 1-5 who by God's power are being guarded <f>ⓝ</f>through faith for a salvation <f>ⓞ</f>ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter 1-6 In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by <f>ⓟ</f>various trials,
1 Peter 1-7 so that <f>ⓠ</f>the tested genuineness of your faith — more precious than gold that perishes <f>ⓡ</f>though it is tested by <f>ⓢ</f>fire — may be found to result in <f>ⓣ</f>praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
1 Peter 1-8 <f>ⓤ</f> Though you have not seen him, you love him. <f>ⓥ</f>Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
1 Peter 1-9 obtaining <f>ⓦ</f>the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
1 Peter 1-10 <pb/>Concerning this salvation, <f>ⓧ</f>the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully,
1 Peter 1-11 inquiring <f>ⓨ</f>what person or time <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating <f>ⓐ</f>when he predicted <f>ⓑ</f>the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
1 Peter 1-12 <f>ⓒ</f> It was revealed to them that <f>ⓓ</f>they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you <f>ⓔ</f>by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, <f>ⓕ</f>things into which angels long to look.
1 Peter 1-13 <pb/>Therefore, <f>ⓖ</f>preparing your minds for action, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓗ</f>being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
1 Peter 1-14 As obedient children, <f>ⓘ</f>do not be conformed to the passions <f>ⓙ</f>of your former ignorance,
1 Peter 1-15 but <f>ⓚ</f>as he who called you is holy, you also be holy <f>ⓛ</f>in all your conduct,
1 Peter 1-16 since it is written, <f>ⓜ</f>“You shall be holy, for I am holy.”
1 Peter 1-17 And if you <f>ⓝ</f>call on him as Father who <f>ⓞ</f>judges <f>ⓟ</f>impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves <f>ⓠ</f>with fear throughout the time of your exile,
1 Peter 1-18 knowing that you <f>ⓡ</f>were ransomed from <f>ⓢ</f>the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
1 Peter 1-19 but <f>ⓣ</f>with the precious blood of Christ, like that of <f>ⓤ</f>a lamb <f>ⓥ</f>without blemish or spot.
1 Peter 1-20 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but <f>ⓦ</f>was made manifest <f>ⓧ</f>in the last times for the sake of you
1 Peter 1-21 <f>ⓨ</f> who through him are believers in God, <f>ⓩ</f>who raised him from the dead and <f>ⓐ</f>gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
1 Peter 1-22 <pb/>Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for <f>ⓑ</f>a sincere brotherly love, <f>ⓒ</f>love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
1 Peter 1-23 <f>ⓓ</f> since you have been born again, <f>ⓔ</f>not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through <f>ⓕ</f>the living and abiding word of God;
1 Peter 1-24 for <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“All flesh is like grass </t><t>and all its glory like the flower of grass. </t><t>The grass withers, </t><t>and the flower falls,</t>
1 Peter 1-25 <t><f>ⓗ</f> but the word of the Lord remains forever.” </t> <pb/>And this word <f>ⓘ</f>is the good news that was preached to you.
