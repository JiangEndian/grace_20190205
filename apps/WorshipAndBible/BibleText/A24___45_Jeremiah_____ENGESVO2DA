Jeremiah 45-1 <pb/>The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to <f>ⓐ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah, <f>ⓑ</f>when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, <f>ⓒ</f>in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
Jeremiah 45-2 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
Jeremiah 45-3 You said, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain. <f>ⓔ</f>I am weary with my groaning, <f>ⓕ</f>and I find no rest.’
Jeremiah 45-4 Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓖ</f>Behold, what I have built I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am plucking up — that is, the whole land.
Jeremiah 45-5 And <f>ⓗ</f>do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the LORD. But I will give you <f>ⓙ</f>your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go.”
