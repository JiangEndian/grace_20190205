Matthew 22-1 <pb/>And again Jesus <f>ⓐ</f>spoke to them in parables, saying,
Matthew 22-2 <J><f>ⓑ</f> “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave <f>ⓒ</f>a wedding feast for his son,</J>
Matthew 22-3 <J>and <f>ⓓ</f>sent his servants <f>[1]</f> to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.</J>
Matthew 22-4 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my <f>ⓕ</f>dinner, <f>ⓖ</f>my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’</J>
Matthew 22-5 <J>But <f>ⓗ</f>they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,</J>
Matthew 22-6 <J>while the rest seized his servants, <f>ⓘ</f>treated them shamefully, and <f>ⓙ</f>killed them.</J>
Matthew 22-7 <J>The king was angry, and he sent his troops and <f>ⓚ</f>destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</J>
Matthew 22-8 <J>Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not <f>ⓛ</f>worthy.</J>
Matthew 22-9 <J>Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’</J>
Matthew 22-10 <J>And those servants went out into the roads and <f>ⓜ</f>gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.</J>
Matthew 22-11 <pb/><J>“But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there <f>ⓝ</f>a man who had no wedding garment.</J>
Matthew 22-12 <J>And he said to him, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.</J>
Matthew 22-13 <J>Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and <f>ⓟ</f>cast him into the outer darkness. In that place <f>ⓠ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</J>
Matthew 22-14 <J>For many are <f>ⓡ</f>called, but few are <f>ⓢ</f>chosen.”</J>
Matthew 22-15 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Then the Pharisees went and plotted how <f>ⓤ</f>to entangle him in his words.
Matthew 22-16 And they sent <f>ⓥ</f>their disciples to him, along with <f>ⓦ</f>the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, <f>ⓧ</f>we know that you are true and teach <f>ⓨ</f>the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for <f>ⓩ</f>you are not swayed by appearances. <f>[2]</f>
Matthew 22-17 Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay <f>ⓐ</f>taxes to <f>ⓑ</f>Caesar, or not?”
Matthew 22-18 But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, <J>“Why <f>ⓒ</f>put me to the test, you hypocrites?</J>
Matthew 22-19 <J>Show me the coin for the tax.”</J> And they brought him a denarius. <f>[3]</f>
Matthew 22-20 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Whose likeness and inscription is this?”</J>
Matthew 22-21 They said, “Caesar's.” Then he said to them, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</J>
Matthew 22-22 When they heard it, they marveled. And they <f>ⓔ</f>left him and went away.
Matthew 22-23 <pb/>The same day <f>ⓕ</f>Sadducees came to him, <f>ⓖ</f>who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question,
Matthew 22-24 saying, “Teacher, Moses said, <f>ⓗ</f>‘If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.’
Matthew 22-25 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother.
Matthew 22-26 So too the second and third, down to the seventh.
Matthew 22-27 After them all, the woman died.
Matthew 22-28 In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.”
Matthew 22-29 <pb/>But Jesus answered them, <J>“You are wrong, <f>ⓘ</f>because you know neither the Scriptures nor <f>ⓙ</f>the power of God.</J>
Matthew 22-30 <J>For in the resurrection they neither <f>ⓚ</f>marry nor <f>ⓛ</f>are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</J>
Matthew 22-31 <J>And as for the resurrection of the dead, <f>ⓜ</f>have you not read what was said to you by God:</J>
Matthew 22-32 <J><f>ⓝ</f> ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.”</J>
Matthew 22-33 And when the crowd heard it, <f>ⓞ</f>they were astonished at his teaching.
Matthew 22-34 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced <f>ⓠ</f>the Sadducees, they gathered together.
Matthew 22-35 <f>ⓡ</f> And one of them, <f>ⓢ</f>a lawyer, asked him a question <f>ⓣ</f>to test him.
Matthew 22-36 “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?”
Matthew 22-37 And he said to him, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.</J>
Matthew 22-38 <J>This is the great and first commandment.</J>
Matthew 22-39 <J>And <f>ⓥ</f>a second is like it: <f>ⓦ</f>You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</J>
Matthew 22-40 <J><f>ⓧ</f> On these two commandments depend <f>ⓨ</f>all the Law and the Prophets.”</J>
Matthew 22-41 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> Now while the Pharisees <f>ⓐ</f>were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
Matthew 22-42 saying, <J>“What do you think about <f>ⓑ</f>the Christ? Whose son is he?”</J> They said to him, <f>ⓒ</f>“The son of David.”
Matthew 22-43 He said to them, <J>“How is it then that David, <f>ⓓ</f>in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,</J>
Matthew 22-44 <pb/><t><J><f>ⓔ</f> “‘The Lord said to my Lord,</J> </t><t><J>“Sit at my right hand,</J> </t><t><J>until I put your enemies under your feet”’?</J> </t>
Matthew 22-45 <pb/><J>If then David calls him Lord, <f>ⓕ</f>how is he his son?”</J>
Matthew 22-46 <f>ⓖ</f> And no one was able to answer him a word, <f>ⓗ</f>nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.
