Acts 26-1 <pb/>So <f>ⓐ</f>Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:
Acts 26-2 <pb/>“I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today <f>ⓑ</f>against all the accusations of the Jews,
Acts 26-3 especially because you are familiar with all the <f>ⓒ</f>customs and <f>ⓓ</f>controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
Acts 26-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> “My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among <f>ⓕ</f>my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews.
Acts 26-5 They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that <f>ⓖ</f>according to the strictest <f>ⓗ</f>party of our <f>ⓘ</f>religion I have lived as <f>ⓙ</f>a Pharisee.
Acts 26-6 And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in <f>ⓚ</f>the promise made by God to our fathers,
Acts 26-7 <f>ⓛ</f> to which <f>ⓜ</f>our twelve tribes hope to <f>ⓝ</f>attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope <f>ⓞ</f>I am accused by Jews, O king!
Acts 26-8 Why is it thought <f>ⓟ</f>incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
Acts 26-9 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of <f>ⓡ</f>Jesus of Nazareth.
Acts 26-10 <f>ⓢ</f> And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority <f>ⓣ</f>from the chief priests, but <f>ⓤ</f>when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.
Acts 26-11 And <f>ⓥ</f>I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them <f>ⓦ</f>blaspheme, and <f>ⓧ</f>in raging fury against them I <f>ⓨ</f>persecuted them even to foreign cities.
Acts 26-12 <pb/>“In this connection <f>ⓩ</f>I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
Acts 26-13 At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me.
Acts 26-14 And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me <f>ⓐ</f>in the Hebrew language, <f>[1]</f> <J>‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’</J>
Acts 26-15 And I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, <J>‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</J>
Acts 26-16 <J>But rise and <f>ⓑ</f>stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, <f>ⓒ</f>to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,</J>
Acts 26-17 <J><f>ⓓ</f> delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles — <f>ⓔ</f>to whom I <f>ⓕ</f>am sending you</J>
Acts 26-18 <J><f>ⓖ</f> to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from <f>ⓗ</f>the power of Satan to God, that they may receive <f>ⓘ</f>forgiveness of sins and <f>ⓙ</f>a place among those who are sanctified <f>ⓚ</f>by faith in me.’</J>
Acts 26-19 <pb/>“Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to <f>ⓛ</f>the heavenly vision,
Acts 26-20 but declared first <f>ⓜ</f>to those in Damascus, <f>ⓝ</f>then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also <f>ⓞ</f>to the Gentiles, that they should <f>ⓟ</f>repent and <f>ⓠ</f>turn to God, performing deeds <f>ⓡ</f>in keeping with their repentance.
Acts 26-21 For this reason <f>ⓢ</f>the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
Acts 26-22 <f>ⓣ</f> To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so <f>ⓤ</f>I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what <f>ⓥ</f>the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:
Acts 26-23 <f>ⓦ</f> that the Christ <f>ⓧ</f>must suffer and that, <f>ⓨ</f>by being the first <f>ⓩ</f>to rise from the dead, <f>ⓐ</f>he would proclaim <f>ⓑ</f>light both to our people and to the Gentiles.”
Acts 26-24 <pb/>And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, <f>ⓒ</f>you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.”
Acts 26-25 But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, <f>ⓓ</f>most excellent Festus, but I am speaking <f>ⓔ</f>true and <f>ⓕ</f>rational words.
Acts 26-26 For <f>ⓖ</f>the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.
Acts 26-27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.”
Acts 26-28 And Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time would you persuade me to be <f>ⓗ</f>a Christian?” <f>[2]</f>
Acts 26-29 And Paul said, “Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day <f>ⓘ</f>might become such as I am — except for <f>ⓙ</f>these chains.”
Acts 26-30 <pb/>Then the king rose, and <f>ⓚ</f>the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them.
Acts 26-31 And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, <f>ⓛ</f>“This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.”
Acts 26-32 And Agrippa said to Festus, <f>ⓜ</f>“This man could have been set <f>ⓝ</f>free if he had not appealed <f>ⓞ</f>to Caesar.”
