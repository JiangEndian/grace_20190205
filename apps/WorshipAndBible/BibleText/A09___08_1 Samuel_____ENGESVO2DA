1 Samuel 8-1 <pb/>When Samuel became old, <f>ⓐ</f>he made his sons judges over Israel.
1 Samuel 8-2 The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba.
1 Samuel 8-3 Yet his sons did not walk in his ways <f>ⓑ</f>but turned aside after gain. <f>ⓒ</f>They took bribes and perverted justice.
1 Samuel 8-4 <pb/>Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at <f>ⓓ</f>Ramah
1 Samuel 8-5 and said to him, “Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways. <f>ⓔ</f>Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.”
1 Samuel 8-6 But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” And Samuel prayed to the LORD.
1 Samuel 8-7 And the LORD said to Samuel, “Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, <f>ⓕ</f>for they have not rejected you, <f>ⓖ</f>but they have rejected me from being king over them.
1 Samuel 8-8 According to all the deeds that they have done, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you.
1 Samuel 8-9 Now then, obey their voice; only you shall solemnly warn them <f>ⓗ</f>and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.”
1 Samuel 8-10 <pb/>So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking for a king from him.
1 Samuel 8-11 He said, <f>ⓘ</f>“These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: <f>ⓙ</f>he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots.
1 Samuel 8-12 And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some <f>ⓚ</f>to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.
1 Samuel 8-13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
1 Samuel 8-14 <f>ⓛ</f> He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.
1 Samuel 8-15 He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.
1 Samuel 8-16 He will take your male servants and female servants and the best of your young men <f>[1]</f> and your donkeys, and put them to his work.
1 Samuel 8-17 He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.
1 Samuel 8-18 And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, <f>ⓜ</f>but the LORD will not answer you in that day.”
1 Samuel 8-19 <pb/>But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel. And they said, “No! But there shall be a king over us,
1 Samuel 8-20 <f>ⓝ</f> that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”
1 Samuel 8-21 And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.
1 Samuel 8-22 And the LORD said to Samuel, <f>ⓞ</f>“Obey their voice and make them a king.” Samuel then said to the men of Israel, “Go every man to his city.”
