1 Samuel 13-1 <pb/>Saul lived for one year and then became king, and when he had reigned for two years over Israel, <f>[1]</f>
1 Samuel 13-2 Saul chose three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in <f>ⓐ</f>Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in <f>ⓑ</f>Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent.
1 Samuel 13-3 Jonathan defeated <f>ⓒ</f>the garrison of the Philistines that was <f>ⓓ</f>at Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul <f>ⓔ</f>blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear.”
1 Samuel 13-4 And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.
1 Samuel 13-5 <pb/>And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and troops <f>ⓕ</f>like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of <f>ⓖ</f>Beth-aven.
1 Samuel 13-6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves <f>ⓗ</f>in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns,
1 Samuel 13-7 and some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
1 Samuel 13-8 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.
1 Samuel 13-9 So Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering.
1 Samuel 13-10 As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him and greet him.
1 Samuel 13-11 Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash,
1 Samuel 13-12 I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’ So I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering.”
1 Samuel 13-13 And Samuel said to Saul, <f>ⓙ</f>“You have done foolishly. <f>ⓚ</f>You have not kept the command of the LORD your God, with which he commanded you. For then the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
1 Samuel 13-14 But now <f>ⓛ</f>your kingdom shall not continue. The LORD has sought out a man <f>ⓜ</f>after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be prince <f>[2]</f> over his people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.”
1 Samuel 13-15 And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal. The rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the army; they went up from Gilgal <f>[3]</f> to <f>ⓝ</f>Gibeah of Benjamin. <pb/>And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, <f>ⓞ</f>about six hundred men.
1 Samuel 13-16 And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in <f>ⓟ</f>Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
1 Samuel 13-17 And <f>ⓠ</f>raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
1 Samuel 13-18 another company turned toward <f>ⓡ</f>Beth-horon; and another company turned toward the border that looks down on the Valley of <f>ⓢ</f>Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1 Samuel 13-19 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears.”
1 Samuel 13-20 But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle, <f>[4]</f>
1 Samuel 13-21 and the charge was two-thirds of a shekel <f>[5]</f> for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel <f>[6]</f> for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads. <f>[7]</f>
1 Samuel 13-22 So on the day of the battle <f>ⓤ</f>there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.
1 Samuel 13-23 And <f>ⓥ</f>the garrison of the Philistines went out to the <f>ⓦ</f>pass of <f>ⓧ</f>Michmash.
