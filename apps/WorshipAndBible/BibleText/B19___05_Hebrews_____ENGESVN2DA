Hebrews 5-1 <pb/>For every high priest chosen from among men <f>ⓐ</f>is appointed to act on behalf of men <f>ⓑ</f>in relation to God, <f>ⓒ</f>to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
Hebrews 5-2 <f>ⓓ</f> He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself <f>ⓔ</f>is beset with weakness.
Hebrews 5-3 Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins <f>ⓕ</f>just as he does for those of the people.
Hebrews 5-4 And <f>ⓖ</f>no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, <f>ⓗ</f>just as Aaron was.
Hebrews 5-5 <pb/>So also Christ <f>ⓘ</f>did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“You are my Son, </t><t>today I have begotten you”; </t>
Hebrews 5-6 <pb/>as he says also in another place, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“You are a priest forever, </t><t>after the order of Melchizedek.” </t>
Hebrews 5-7 <pb/>In the days of his flesh, <f>ⓛ</f>Jesus <f>[1]</f> offered up prayers and supplications, <f>ⓜ</f>with loud cries and tears, to him <f>ⓝ</f>who was able to save him from death, and <f>ⓞ</f>he was heard because of his reverence.
Hebrews 5-8 Although <f>ⓟ</f>he was a son, <f>ⓠ</f>he learned obedience through what he suffered.
Hebrews 5-9 And <f>ⓡ</f>being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,
Hebrews 5-10 being designated by God a high priest <f>ⓢ</f>after the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews 5-11 <pb/>About this we have much to say, and it is <f>ⓣ</f>hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.
Hebrews 5-12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again <f>ⓤ</f>the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need <f>ⓥ</f>milk, not solid food,
Hebrews 5-13 for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is <f>ⓦ</f>a child.
Hebrews 5-14 But solid food is for <f>ⓧ</f>the mature, for those who have their powers <f>ⓨ</f>of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.
