Jeremiah 11-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 11-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 11-3 You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: <f>ⓑ</f>Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant
Jeremiah 11-4 that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, <f>ⓒ</f>from the iron furnace, saying, <f>ⓓ</f>Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. <f>ⓔ</f>So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,
Jeremiah 11-5 <f>ⓕ</f> that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, <f>ⓖ</f>to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.” Then I answered, “So be it, LORD.”
Jeremiah 11-6 <pb/>And the LORD said to me, <f>ⓗ</f>“Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: <f>ⓘ</f>Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
Jeremiah 11-7 For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, <f>ⓙ</f>warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, <f>ⓚ</f>Obey my voice.
Jeremiah 11-8 <f>ⓛ</f> Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, <f>ⓜ</f>but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all <f>ⓝ</f>the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.”
Jeremiah 11-9 <pb/>Again the LORD said to me, <f>ⓞ</f>“A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 11-10 They have turned back to <f>ⓟ</f>the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. <f>ⓠ</f>They have gone after other gods to serve them. <f>ⓡ</f>The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers.
Jeremiah 11-11 Therefore, thus says the LORD, Behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. <f>ⓢ</f>Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them.
Jeremiah 11-12 Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem <f>ⓣ</f>will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, <f>ⓤ</f>but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble.
Jeremiah 11-13 <f>ⓥ</f> For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, <f>ⓦ</f>altars to make offerings to Baal.
Jeremiah 11-14 <pb/>“Therefore <f>ⓧ</f>do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, <f>ⓨ</f>for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.
Jeremiah 11-15 <f>ⓩ</f> What right has my beloved in my house, <f>ⓐ</f>when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? <f>ⓑ</f>Can you then exult?
Jeremiah 11-16 The LORD once called you <f>ⓒ</f>‘a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.’ But <f>ⓓ</f>with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and <f>ⓔ</f>its branches will be consumed.
Jeremiah 11-17 The LORD of hosts, <f>ⓕ</f>who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, <f>ⓖ</f>provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal.”
Jeremiah 11-18 <pb/><t>The LORD made it known to me and I knew; </t><t>then you showed me their deeds.</t>
Jeremiah 11-19 <t>But I was <f>ⓗ</f>like a gentle lamb </t><t>led to the slaughter. </t><t>I did not know <f>ⓘ</f>it was against me </t><t>they devised schemes, saying, </t><t>“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>let us cut him off from <f>ⓚ</f>the land of the living, </t><t>that his name be remembered no more.”</t>
Jeremiah 11-20 <t>But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, </t><t>who <f>ⓛ</f>tests <f>ⓜ</f>the heart and the mind, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>let me see your vengeance upon them, </t><t>for to you have I committed my cause. </t>
Jeremiah 11-21 <pb/>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of <f>ⓞ</f>Anathoth, <f>ⓟ</f>who seek your life, and say, <f>ⓠ</f>“Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand” —
Jeremiah 11-22 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: “Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,
Jeremiah 11-23 and none of them shall be left. For I will bring disaster upon the men of <f>ⓡ</f>Anathoth, <f>ⓢ</f>the year of their punishment.”
