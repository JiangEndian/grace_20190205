1 Thessalonians 5-1 <pb/>Now concerning <f>ⓐ</f>the times and the seasons, brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>you have no need to have anything written to you.
1 Thessalonians 5-2 For you yourselves are fully aware that <f>ⓒ</f>the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians 5-3 While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then <f>ⓓ</f>sudden destruction will come upon them <f>ⓔ</f>as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
1 Thessalonians 5-4 But you <f>ⓕ</f>are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief.
1 Thessalonians 5-5 For you are all <f>ⓖ</f>children <f>[2]</f> of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness.
1 Thessalonians 5-6 So then <f>ⓗ</f>let us not sleep, as others do, but let us <f>ⓘ</f>keep awake and <f>ⓙ</f>be sober.
1 Thessalonians 5-7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, <f>ⓚ</f>are drunk at night.
1 Thessalonians 5-8 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, <f>ⓛ</f>having put on the breastplate of <f>ⓜ</f>faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
1 Thessalonians 5-9 For God has not destined us for <f>ⓝ</f>wrath, but <f>ⓞ</f>to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Thessalonians 5-10 <f>ⓟ</f> who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him.
1 Thessalonians 5-11 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.
1 Thessalonians 5-12 <pb/>We ask you, brothers, <f>ⓠ</f>to respect those who labor among you and <f>ⓡ</f>are over you in the Lord and admonish you,
1 Thessalonians 5-13 and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. <f>ⓢ</f>Be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians 5-14 And we urge you, brothers, admonish <f>ⓣ</f>the idle, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>encourage the fainthearted, <f>ⓥ</f>help the weak, <f>ⓦ</f>be patient with them all.
1 Thessalonians 5-15 See that <f>ⓧ</f>no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always <f>ⓨ</f>seek to do good to one another and to everyone.
1 Thessalonians 5-16 <f>ⓩ</f> Rejoice always,
1 Thessalonians 5-17 <f>ⓐ</f> pray without ceasing,
1 Thessalonians 5-18 <f>ⓑ</f> give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
1 Thessalonians 5-19 <f>ⓒ</f> Do not quench the Spirit.
1 Thessalonians 5-20 Do not despise <f>ⓓ</f>prophecies,
1 Thessalonians 5-21 but <f>ⓔ</f>test everything; hold fast what is good.
1 Thessalonians 5-22 Abstain from every form of evil.
1 Thessalonians 5-23 <pb/>Now may <f>ⓕ</f>the God of peace himself <f>ⓖ</f>sanctify you completely, and may your <f>ⓗ</f>whole <f>ⓘ</f>spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at <f>ⓙ</f>the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians 5-24 <f>ⓚ</f> He who calls you is faithful; <f>ⓛ</f>he will surely do it.
1 Thessalonians 5-25 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Brothers, pray for us.
1 Thessalonians 5-26 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians 5-27 <pb/>I put you under oath before the Lord to have <f>ⓞ</f>this letter read to all the brothers.
1 Thessalonians 5-28 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
