Ezekiel 39-1 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>prophesy against <f>ⓒ</f>Gog and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, <f>ⓓ</f>I am against you, O Gog, <f>ⓔ</f>chief prince of <f>ⓕ</f>Meshech <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>Tubal.
Ezekiel 39-2 <f>ⓗ</f> And I will turn you about and drive you forward, <f>[2]</f> and bring you up from <f>ⓘ</f>the uttermost parts of the north, and lead you against the <f>ⓙ</f>mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel 39-3 Then <f>ⓚ</f>I will strike your bow from your left hand, and <f>ⓛ</f>will make your arrows drop out of your right hand.
Ezekiel 39-4 <f>ⓜ</f> You shall fall on <f>ⓝ</f>the mountains of Israel, you and all your <f>ⓞ</f>hordes and the peoples who are with you. <f>ⓟ</f>I will give you to birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
Ezekiel 39-5 You shall fall in the open field, for <f>ⓠ</f>I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 39-6 <f>ⓡ</f> I will send fire on <f>ⓢ</f>Magog and on those <f>ⓣ</f>who dwell securely in <f>ⓤ</f>the coastlands, and <f>ⓥ</f>they shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 39-7 <pb/>“And <f>ⓦ</f>my holy name I will make known in the midst of my people Israel, and <f>ⓧ</f>I will not let my holy name be profaned anymore. And <f>ⓨ</f>the nations shall know that I am <f>ⓩ</f>the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.
Ezekiel 39-8 <f>ⓐ</f> Behold, it is coming and it will be brought about, declares the Lord GOD. That is the day <f>ⓑ</f>of which I have spoken.
Ezekiel 39-9 <pb/>“Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and <f>ⓒ</f>make fires of the weapons and burn them, shields and bucklers, bow and arrows, <f>ⓓ</f>clubs <f>[3]</f> and spears; and they will make fires of them for seven years,
Ezekiel 39-10 so that they will not need to take wood out of the field or cut down any out of the forests, for <f>ⓔ</f>they will make their fires of the weapons. <f>ⓕ</f>They will seize the spoil of those who despoiled them, and plunder those who plundered them, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 39-11 <pb/>“On that day I will give to <f>ⓖ</f>Gog a place for burial in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers, east of the sea. It will block the travelers, for there Gog and all his multitude will be buried. It will be called the Valley of <f>ⓗ</f>Hamon-gog. <f>[4]</f>
Ezekiel 39-12 For <f>ⓘ</f>seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order <f>ⓙ</f>to cleanse the land.
Ezekiel 39-13 All the people of the land will bury them, and it will bring them renown on the day that <f>ⓚ</f>I show my glory, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 39-14 They will set apart men to travel through the land regularly and bury those travelers remaining on the face of the land, so as <f>ⓛ</f>to cleanse it. At <f>[5]</f> the end of <f>ⓜ</f>seven months they will make their search.
Ezekiel 39-15 And when these travel through the land and anyone sees a human bone, then he shall set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of <f>ⓝ</f>Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel 39-16 (Hamonah <f>[6]</f> is also the name of the city.) Thus shall they cleanse the land.
Ezekiel 39-17 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓞ</f>son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓟ</f>Speak to <f>ⓠ</f>the birds of every sort and to <f>ⓡ</f>all beasts of the field: ‘Assemble and come, gather from all around to <f>ⓢ</f>the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great sacrificial feast on the mountains of Israel, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood.
Ezekiel 39-18 <f>ⓣ</f> You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth — of rams, of lambs, and of he-goats, of bulls, all of them <f>ⓤ</f>fat beasts of Bashan.
Ezekiel 39-19 And you shall eat fat till you are filled, and drink blood till you are drunk, at the sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you.
Ezekiel 39-20 And you shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers, with mighty men and all kinds of warriors,’ declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 39-21 <pb/>“And <f>ⓥ</f>I will set my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see <f>ⓦ</f>my judgment that I have executed, and <f>ⓧ</f>my hand that I have laid on them.
Ezekiel 39-22 <f>ⓨ</f> The house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God, from that day forward.
Ezekiel 39-23 And <f>ⓩ</f>the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they dealt so treacherously with me that <f>ⓐ</f>I hid my face from them and <f>ⓑ</f>gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword.
Ezekiel 39-24 I dealt with them <f>ⓒ</f>according to their uncleanness and their transgressions, and hid my face from them.
Ezekiel 39-25 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now <f>ⓓ</f>I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on <f>ⓔ</f>the whole house of Israel, and <f>ⓕ</f>I will be jealous for my holy name.
Ezekiel 39-26 They shall <f>ⓖ</f>forget their shame and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when <f>ⓗ</f>they dwell securely in their land with <f>ⓘ</f>none to make them afraid,
Ezekiel 39-27 <f>ⓙ</f> when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies' lands, <f>ⓚ</f>and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations.
Ezekiel 39-28 <f>ⓛ</f> Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God, because I sent them into exile among the nations and then assembled them into their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations anymore.
Ezekiel 39-29 <f>ⓜ</f> And I will not hide my face anymore from them, when <f>ⓝ</f>I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.”
