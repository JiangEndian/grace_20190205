Mark 10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And he left there and went <f>ⓑ</f>to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered to him again. And again, as was his custom, he taught them.
Mark 10-2 <pb/>And Pharisees came up and in order <f>ⓒ</f>to test him asked, <f>ⓓ</f>“Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”
Mark 10-3 He answered them, <J>“What did Moses command you?”</J>
Mark 10-4 They said, <f>ⓔ</f>“Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.”
Mark 10-5 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Because of your <f>ⓕ</f>hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.</J>
Mark 10-6 <J>But <f>ⓖ</f>from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them <f>ⓗ</f>male and female.’</J>
Mark 10-7 <J><f>ⓘ</f> ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, <f>[1]</f></J>
Mark 10-8 <J>and <f>ⓙ</f>the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh.</J>
Mark 10-9 <J><f>ⓚ</f> What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”</J>
Mark 10-10 <pb/>And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.
Mark 10-11 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her,</J>
Mark 10-12 <J>and <f>ⓜ</f>if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”</J>
Mark 10-13 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples <f>ⓞ</f>rebuked them.
Mark 10-14 But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Let the children come to me; <f>ⓠ</f>do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</J>
Mark 10-15 <J><f>ⓡ</f> Truly, I say to you, whoever does not <f>ⓢ</f>receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”</J>
Mark 10-16 And <f>ⓣ</f>he took them in his arms and blessed them, <f>ⓤ</f>laying his hands on them.
Mark 10-17 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and <f>ⓦ</f>knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to <f>ⓧ</f>inherit eternal life?”
Mark 10-18 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</J>
Mark 10-19 <J>You know the commandments: <f>ⓨ</f>‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’”</J>
Mark 10-20 And he said to him, “Teacher, <f>ⓩ</f>all these I have kept from my youth.”
Mark 10-21 And Jesus, <f>ⓐ</f>looking at him, <f>ⓑ</f>loved him, and said to him, <J>“You lack one thing: go, <f>ⓒ</f>sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have <f>ⓓ</f>treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</J>
Mark 10-22 <f>ⓔ</f> Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
Mark 10-23 <pb/>And Jesus <f>ⓕ</f>looked around and said to his disciples, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter <f>ⓗ</f>the kingdom of God!”</J>
Mark 10-24 And the disciples <f>ⓘ</f>were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“Children, <f>ⓚ</f>how difficult it is <f>[2]</f> to enter <f>ⓛ</f>the kingdom of God!</J>
Mark 10-25 <J>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter <f>ⓜ</f>the kingdom of God.”</J>
Mark 10-26 And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, <f>[3]</f> “Then who can be saved?”
Mark 10-27 Jesus <f>ⓝ</f>looked at them and said, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.”</J>
Mark 10-28 Peter began to say to him, “See, <f>ⓟ</f>we have left everything and followed you.”
Mark 10-29 Jesus said, <J>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓠ</f>there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and <f>ⓡ</f>for the gospel,</J>
Mark 10-30 <J>who will not receive a hundredfold <f>ⓢ</f>now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, <f>ⓣ</f>with persecutions, and in <f>ⓤ</f>the age to come eternal life.</J>
Mark 10-31 <J>But <f>ⓥ</f>many who are first will be last, and the last first.”</J>
Mark 10-32 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and <f>ⓧ</f>Jesus was walking ahead of them. And <f>ⓨ</f>they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him,
Mark 10-33 saying, <J>“See, <f>ⓩ</f>we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will <f>ⓐ</f>condemn him to death and <f>ⓑ</f>deliver him over to the Gentiles.</J>
Mark 10-34 <J>And they will <f>ⓒ</f>mock him and <f>ⓓ</f>spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And <f>ⓔ</f>after three days he will rise.”</J>
Mark 10-35 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And James and John, <f>ⓖ</f>the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us <f>ⓗ</f>whatever we ask of you.”
Mark 10-36 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“What do you want me to do for you?”</J>
Mark 10-37 And they said to him, “Grant us <f>ⓙ</f>to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, <f>ⓚ</f>in your glory.”
Mark 10-38 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“You do not know what you are asking. Are you able <f>ⓜ</f>to drink the cup that I drink, or <f>ⓝ</f>to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”</J>
Mark 10-39 And they said to him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“The cup that I drink <f>ⓟ</f>you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, <f>ⓠ</f>you will be baptized,</J>
Mark 10-40 <J>but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, <f>ⓡ</f>but it is for those for whom it has been <f>ⓢ</f>prepared.”</J>
Mark 10-41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John.
Mark 10-42 <f>ⓣ</f> And Jesus called them to him and said to them, <J>“You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles <f>ⓤ</f>lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</J>
Mark 10-43 <J>But <f>ⓥ</f>it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, <f>[4]</f></J>
Mark 10-44 <J>and whoever would be first among you must be <f>ⓦ</f>slave <f>[5]</f> of all.</J>
Mark 10-45 <J>For even the Son of Man came not to be served but <f>ⓧ</f>to serve, and <f>ⓨ</f>to give his life as a ransom for <f>ⓩ</f>many.”</J>
Mark 10-46 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And they came to Jericho. And <f>ⓑ</f>as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, <f>ⓒ</f>a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside.
Mark 10-47 And when he heard that it was <f>ⓓ</f>Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
Mark 10-48 And many <f>ⓔ</f>rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
Mark 10-49 And Jesus stopped and said, <J>“Call him.”</J> And they called the blind man, saying to him, <f>ⓕ</f>“Take heart. Get up; he is calling you.”
Mark 10-50 And throwing off his <f>ⓖ</f>cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus.
Mark 10-51 And Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“What do you want me to do for you?”</J> And the blind man said to him, <f>ⓘ</f>“Rabbi, let me recover my sight.”
Mark 10-52 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Go your way; <f>ⓙ</f>your faith has <f>ⓚ</f>made you well.”</J> And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him on the way.
