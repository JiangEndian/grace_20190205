Amos 9-1 <pb/>I saw the Lord standing beside <f>[1]</f> the altar, and he said: <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f>“Strike the capitals until <f>ⓑ</f>the thresholds <f>ⓒ</f>shake, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>and shatter them on the heads of all the people; <f>[2]</f> </t><t>and those who are left of them I will kill with the sword; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>not one of them shall flee away; </t><t>not one of them shall escape. </t>
Amos 9-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> “If they dig into Sheol, </t><t>from there shall my hand take them; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>if they climb up to heaven, </t><t>from there I will bring them down.</t>
Amos 9-3 <t>If they hide themselves on <f>ⓗ</f>the top of Carmel, </t><t>from there I will search them out and take them; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>and if they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea, </t><t>there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them.</t>
Amos 9-4 <t><f>ⓙ</f> And if they go into captivity before their enemies, </t><t>there I will command the sword, and it shall kill them; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>and I will fix my eyes upon them </t><t>for evil and not for good.” </t>
Amos 9-5 <pb/><t>The Lord GOD of hosts, </t><t>he who touches the earth and <f>ⓛ</f>it melts, </t><t>and all who dwell in it mourn, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and all of it rises like the Nile, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>and sinks again, like the Nile of Egypt;</t>
Amos 9-6 <t><f>ⓞ</f> who builds his upper chambers in the heavens </t><t>and founds his vault upon the earth; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>who calls for the waters of the sea </t><t>and pours them out upon the surface of the earth — </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>the LORD is his name. </t>
Amos 9-7 <pb/><t>“Are you not like <f>ⓡ</f>the Cushites to me, </t><t>O people of Israel?” declares the LORD. </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>“Did I not bring up Israel from the land of Egypt, </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>the Philistines from <f>ⓤ</f>Caphtor and the Syrians from <f>ⓥ</f>Kir?</t>
Amos 9-8 <t>Behold, <f>ⓦ</f>the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, </t><t>and I will destroy it from the surface of the ground, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
Amos 9-9 <pb/><t>“For behold, I will command, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>and shake the house of Israel among all the nations </t><t>as one shakes with a sieve, </t><t>but no pebble shall fall to the earth.</t>
Amos 9-10 <t>All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, </t><t>who say, <f>ⓩ</f>‘Disaster shall not overtake or meet us.’ </t>
Amos 9-11 <pb/><t>“In that day <f>ⓐ</f>I will raise up </t><t>the booth of David that is fallen </t><t>and repair its breaches, </t><t>and raise up its ruins </t><t>and rebuild it as in the days of old,</t>
Amos 9-12 <t><f>ⓑ</f> that they may possess the remnant of Edom </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>all the nations who are called by my name,” <f>[3]</f> </t><t>declares the LORD who does this. </t>
Amos 9-13 <pb/><t>“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>“when the plowman shall overtake the reaper </t><t>and the treader of grapes him who sows the seed; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>the mountains shall drip sweet wine, </t><t>and all the hills shall flow with it.</t>
Amos 9-14 <t><f>ⓕ</f> I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel, </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>they shall rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>they shall plant vineyards and drink their wine, </t><t>and they shall make gardens and eat their fruit.</t>
Amos 9-15 <t><f>ⓘ</f> I will plant them on their land, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>and they shall never again be uprooted </t><t>out of the land <f>ⓚ</f>that I have given them,” <pb/>says the LORD your God. </t>
