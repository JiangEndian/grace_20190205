Job 3-1 <pb/>After this Job <f>ⓐ</f>opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
Job 3-2 And Job said:
Job 3-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> “Let the day perish on which I was born, </t><t>and the night that said, </t><t>‘A man is conceived.’</t>
Job 3-4 <t>Let that day be darkness! </t><t>May God above not seek it, </t><t>nor light shine upon it.</t>
Job 3-5 <t>Let gloom and <f>ⓒ</f>deep darkness claim it. </t><t>Let clouds dwell upon it; </t><t>let the blackness of the day terrify it.</t>
Job 3-6 <t>That night — let thick darkness seize it! </t><t>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; </t><t>let it not come into the number of the months.</t>
Job 3-7 <t>Behold, let that night be barren; </t><t>let no joyful cry enter it.</t>
Job 3-8 <t>Let those curse it who curse the day, </t><t>who are ready to rouse up <f>ⓓ</f>Leviathan.</t>
Job 3-9 <t>Let the stars of its dawn be dark; </t><t>let it hope for light, but have none, </t><t>nor see <f>ⓔ</f>the eyelids of the morning,</t>
Job 3-10 <t>because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, </t><t>nor hide trouble from my eyes. </t>
Job 3-11 <pb/><t>“Why <f>ⓕ</f>did I not die at birth, </t><t>come out from the womb and expire?</t>
Job 3-12 <t>Why did <f>ⓖ</f>the knees receive me? </t><t>Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?</t>
Job 3-13 <t>For then I would have lain down and been quiet; </t><t>I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,</t>
Job 3-14 <t>with kings and counselors of the earth </t><t>who <f>ⓗ</f>rebuilt ruins for themselves,</t>
Job 3-15 <t>or with princes who had gold, </t><t>who filled their houses with silver.</t>
Job 3-16 <t>Or why was I not as a hidden <f>ⓘ</f>stillborn child, </t><t>as infants who never see the light?</t>
Job 3-17 <t>There the wicked cease from troubling, </t><t>and there the weary are at <f>ⓙ</f>rest.</t>
Job 3-18 <t>There the prisoners are at ease together; </t><t>they hear not the voice of <f>ⓚ</f>the taskmaster.</t>
Job 3-19 <t>The small and the great are there, </t><t>and the slave is free from his master. </t>
Job 3-20 <pb/><t>“Why is light given to him who is in misery, </t><t>and life to <f>ⓛ</f>the bitter in soul,</t>
Job 3-21 <t>who <f>ⓜ</f>long for death, but it comes not, </t><t>and dig for it more than for <f>ⓝ</f>hidden treasures,</t>
Job 3-22 <t>who rejoice exceedingly </t><t>and are glad when they find the grave?</t>
Job 3-23 <t>Why is light given to a man whose <f>ⓞ</f>way is hidden, </t><t>whom God has <f>ⓟ</f>hedged in?</t>
Job 3-24 <t>For my sighing comes <f>ⓠ</f>instead of <f>[1]</f> my bread, </t><t>and my <f>ⓡ</f>groanings are poured out like water.</t>
Job 3-25 <t><f>ⓢ</f> For the thing that I fear comes upon me, </t><t>and what I dread befalls me.</t>
Job 3-26 <t>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; </t><t>I have no rest, but trouble comes.” </t>
