1 Timothy 2-1 <pb/>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,
1 Timothy 2-2 <f>ⓐ</f> for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and <f>ⓑ</f>dignified in every way.
1 Timothy 2-3 This is good, and <f>ⓒ</f>it is pleasing in the sight of <f>ⓓ</f>God our Savior,
1 Timothy 2-4 who desires <f>ⓔ</f>all people to be saved and <f>ⓕ</f>to come to <f>ⓖ</f>the knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy 2-5 For <f>ⓗ</f>there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man <f>[1]</f> Christ Jesus,
1 Timothy 2-6 <f>ⓘ</f> who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is <f>ⓙ</f>the testimony given <f>ⓚ</f>at the proper time.
1 Timothy 2-7 <f>ⓛ</f> For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (<f>ⓜ</f>I am telling the truth, I am not lying), <f>ⓝ</f>a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
1 Timothy 2-8 <pb/>I desire then that <f>ⓞ</f>in every place the men should pray, <f>ⓟ</f>lifting <f>ⓠ</f>holy hands without anger or quarreling;
1 Timothy 2-9 likewise also <f>ⓡ</f>that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire,
1 Timothy 2-10 <f>ⓢ</f> but with what is proper for women who profess godliness — with good works.
1 Timothy 2-11 Let a woman learn quietly <f>ⓣ</f>with all submissiveness.
1 Timothy 2-12 <f>ⓤ</f> I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.
1 Timothy 2-13 <f>ⓥ</f> For Adam was formed first, <f>ⓦ</f>then Eve;
1 Timothy 2-14 and Adam was not deceived, but <f>ⓧ</f>the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
1 Timothy 2-15 Yet she will be saved through <f>ⓨ</f>childbearing — if they continue in <f>ⓩ</f>faith and love and holiness, with self-control.
