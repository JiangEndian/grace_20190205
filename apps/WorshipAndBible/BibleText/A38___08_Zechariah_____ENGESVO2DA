Zechariah 8-1 <pb/>And the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,
Zechariah 8-2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓐ</f>I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
Zechariah 8-3 Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓑ</f>I have returned to Zion and <f>ⓒ</f>will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, <f>ⓓ</f>and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, <f>ⓔ</f>and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain.
Zechariah 8-4 Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓕ</f>Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age.
Zechariah 8-5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
Zechariah 8-6 Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓖ</f>If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, <f>ⓗ</f>should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the LORD of hosts?
Zechariah 8-7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I will save my people <f>ⓙ</f>from the east country and from the west country,
Zechariah 8-8 and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. <f>ⓚ</f>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, <f>ⓛ</f>in faithfulness and in righteousness.”
Zechariah 8-9 <pb/>Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓜ</f>“Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of <f>ⓝ</f>the prophets who were present on <f>ⓞ</f>the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
Zechariah 8-10 For before those days <f>ⓟ</f>there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor.
Zechariah 8-11 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah 8-12 <f>ⓠ</f> For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, <f>ⓡ</f>and the heavens shall give their dew. <f>ⓢ</f>And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
Zechariah 8-13 And as <f>ⓣ</f>you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, <f>ⓤ</f>so will I save you, and <f>ⓥ</f>you shall be a blessing. <f>ⓦ</f>Fear not, but <f>ⓧ</f>let your hands be strong.”
Zechariah 8-14 <pb/>For thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓨ</f>“As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the LORD of hosts,
Zechariah 8-15 so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; <f>ⓩ</f>fear not.
Zechariah 8-16 These are the things that you shall do: <f>ⓐ</f>Speak the truth to one another; <f>ⓑ</f>render in your gates judgments <f>ⓒ</f>that are true and make for peace;
Zechariah 8-17 <f>ⓓ</f> do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and <f>ⓔ</f>love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the LORD.”
Zechariah 8-18 <pb/>And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
Zechariah 8-19 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the <f>ⓕ</f>fourth month and the fast of the <f>ⓖ</f>fifth and the fast of the <f>ⓗ</f>seventh and the fast of the <f>ⓘ</f>tenth shall be to the house of Judah <f>ⓙ</f>seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love <f>ⓚ</f>truth and peace.
Zechariah 8-20 <pb/>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities.
Zechariah 8-21 The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, <f>ⓛ</f>‘Let us go at once <f>ⓜ</f>to entreat the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts; I myself am going.’
Zechariah 8-22 <f>ⓝ</f> Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and <f>ⓞ</f>to entreat the favor of the LORD.
Zechariah 8-23 Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days <f>ⓟ</f>ten men <f>ⓠ</f>from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, ‘Let us go with you, for <f>ⓡ</f>we have heard that God is with you.’”
