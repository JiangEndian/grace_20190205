2 John 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The elder to the elect lady and her children, <f>ⓑ</f>whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who <f>ⓒ</f>know <f>ⓓ</f>the truth,
2 John 1-2 <f>ⓔ</f> because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
2 John 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.
2 John 1-4 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.
2 John 1-5 And now I ask you, dear lady — <f>ⓗ</f>not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning — <f>ⓘ</f>that we love one another.
2 John 1-6 And <f>ⓙ</f>this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just <f>ⓚ</f>as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.
2 John 1-7 For <f>ⓛ</f>many deceivers <f>ⓜ</f>have gone out into the world, <f>ⓝ</f>those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.
2 John 1-8 Watch yourselves, <f>ⓞ</f>so that you may not lose what we <f>[1]</f> have worked for, but <f>ⓟ</f>may win a full reward.
2 John 1-9 Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, <f>ⓠ</f>does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching <f>ⓡ</f>has both the Father and the Son.
2 John 1-10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, <f>ⓢ</f>do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,
2 John 1-11 for whoever greets him <f>ⓣ</f>takes part in his wicked works.
2 John 1-12 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. <f>ⓥ</f>Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, <f>ⓦ</f>so that our joy may be complete.
2 John 1-13 <pb/>The children of your elect sister greet you.
