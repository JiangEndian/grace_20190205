Revelation 9-1 <pb/>And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and <f>ⓐ</f>I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given <f>ⓑ</f>the key to the shaft of <f>ⓒ</f>the bottomless pit. <f>[1]</f>
Revelation 9-2 He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft <f>ⓓ</f>rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and <f>ⓔ</f>the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.
Revelation 9-3 Then from the smoke came <f>ⓕ</f>locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth.
Revelation 9-4 They were told <f>ⓖ</f>not to harm <f>ⓗ</f>the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have <f>ⓘ</f>the seal of God on their foreheads.
Revelation 9-5 They were allowed to torment them <f>ⓙ</f>for five months, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone.
Revelation 9-6 And in those days <f>ⓚ</f>people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them.
Revelation 9-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: <f>ⓜ</f>on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were <f>ⓝ</f>like human faces,
Revelation 9-8 their hair like women's hair, and <f>ⓞ</f>their teeth like lions' teeth;
Revelation 9-9 they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was <f>ⓟ</f>like the noise of many chariots with <f>ⓠ</f>horses rushing into battle.
Revelation 9-10 They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people <f>ⓡ</f>for five months is in their tails.
Revelation 9-11 They have <f>ⓢ</f>as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is <f>ⓣ</f>Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon. <f>[2]</f>
Revelation 9-12 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come.
Revelation 9-13 <pb/>Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from <f>ⓥ</f>the four horns of the golden altar before God,
Revelation 9-14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release <f>ⓦ</f>the four angels who are bound at <f>ⓧ</f>the great river Euphrates.”
Revelation 9-15 So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, were released <f>ⓨ</f>to kill a third of mankind.
Revelation 9-16 The number of <f>ⓩ</f>mounted troops was <f>ⓐ</f>twice ten thousand times ten thousand; <f>ⓑ</f>I heard their number.
Revelation 9-17 And this is how I saw the horses in my vision and those who rode them: they wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire <f>[3]</f> and of sulfur, and the heads of the horses were <f>ⓒ</f>like lions' heads, and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths.
Revelation 9-18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed, by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths.
Revelation 9-19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents with heads, and by means of them they wound.
Revelation 9-20 <pb/>The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, <f>ⓓ</f>did not repent of <f>ⓔ</f>the works of their hands nor give up worshiping <f>ⓕ</f>demons <f>ⓖ</f>and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk,
Revelation 9-21 nor did they repent of their murders or their <f>ⓗ</f>sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.
