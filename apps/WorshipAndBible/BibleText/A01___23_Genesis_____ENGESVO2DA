Genesis 23-1 <pb/>Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis 23-2 And Sarah died at <f>ⓐ</f>Kiriath-arba (that is, <f>ⓑ</f>Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
Genesis 23-3 And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites, <f>[1]</f>
Genesis 23-4 <f>ⓒ</f> “I am a sojourner and foreigner among you; <f>ⓓ</f>give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
Genesis 23-5 The Hittites answered Abraham,
Genesis 23-6 “Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God <f>[2]</f> among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead.”
Genesis 23-7 Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.
Genesis 23-8 And he said to them, “If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,
Genesis 23-9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place.”
Genesis 23-10 <pb/>Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who <f>ⓔ</f>went in at the gate of his city,
Genesis 23-11 “No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”
Genesis 23-12 Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
Genesis 23-13 And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, “But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.”
Genesis 23-14 Ephron answered Abraham,
Genesis 23-15 “My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred <f>ⓕ</f>shekels <f>[3]</f> of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”
Genesis 23-16 Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham <f>ⓖ</f>weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
Genesis 23-17 <pb/>So <f>ⓗ</f>the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over
Genesis 23-18 to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
Genesis 23-19 After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 23-20 The field and the cave that is in it <f>ⓘ</f>were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites.
