Jonah 3-1 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time, saying,
Jonah 3-2 “Arise, go to <f>ⓐ</f>Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it the message that I tell you.”
Jonah 3-3 So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now <f>ⓑ</f>Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, <f>[1]</f> three days' journey in breadth. <f>[2]</f>
Jonah 3-4 Jonah began to go into the city, going a day's journey. And he called out, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”
Jonah 3-5 <f>ⓒ</f> And the people of Nineveh believed God. <f>ⓓ</f>They called for a fast and <f>ⓔ</f>put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them.
Jonah 3-6 <pb/>The word reached <f>[3]</f> the king of Nineveh, and <f>ⓕ</f>he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, <f>ⓖ</f>and sat in ashes.
Jonah 3-7 And he issued a proclamation and published through Nineveh, <f>ⓗ</f>“By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor <f>ⓘ</f>beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water,
Jonah 3-8 but let man and <f>ⓙ</f>beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God. <f>ⓚ</f>Let everyone turn from his evil way and from <f>ⓛ</f>the violence that is in his hands.
Jonah 3-9 <f>ⓜ</f> Who knows? God may turn and relent <f>ⓝ</f>and turn from his fierce anger, so that we may not perish.”
Jonah 3-10 <pb/>When God saw what they did, <f>ⓞ</f>how they turned from their evil way, <f>ⓟ</f>God relented of the disaster that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.
