Isaiah 32-1 <pb/><t>Behold, <f>ⓐ</f>a king will reign in righteousness, </t><t>and princes will rule in justice.</t>
Isaiah 32-2 <t><f>ⓑ</f> Each will be like a hiding place from the wind, </t><t>a shelter from the storm, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>like streams of water in a dry place, </t><t>like the shade of a great rock in a weary land.</t>
Isaiah 32-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed, </t><t>and the ears of those who hear will give attention.</t>
Isaiah 32-4 <t>The heart of the hasty will understand and know, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>and the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak distinctly.</t>
Isaiah 32-5 <t><f>ⓕ</f> The fool will no more be called noble, </t><t>nor the scoundrel said to be honorable.</t>
Isaiah 32-6 <t>For <f>ⓖ</f>the fool speaks folly, </t><t>and his heart is busy with iniquity, </t><t>to practice ungodliness, </t><t>to utter error concerning the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>to leave the craving of the hungry unsatisfied, </t><t>and to deprive the thirsty of drink.</t>
Isaiah 32-7 <t>As for the scoundrel — <f>ⓘ</f>his devices are evil; </t><t>he plans wicked schemes </t><t>to ruin the poor with lying words, </t><t>even when the plea of the needy is right.</t>
Isaiah 32-8 <t>But he who is noble plans noble things, </t><t>and on noble things he stands. </t>

Isaiah 32-10 <t>In little more than a year </t><t>you will shudder, you complacent women; </t><t>for the grape harvest fails, </t><t>the fruit harvest will not come.</t>
Isaiah 32-11 <t>Tremble, you women <f>ⓛ</f>who are at ease, </t><t>shudder, you complacent ones; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>strip, and make yourselves bare, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>and tie sackcloth around your waist.</t>
Isaiah 32-12 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, </t><t>for the fruitful vine,</t>
Isaiah 32-13 <t><f>ⓟ</f> for the soil of my people </t><t>growing up in thorns and briers, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>yes, for all the joyous houses </t><t>in the exultant city.</t>
Isaiah 32-14 <t>For the palace is forsaken, </t><t>the populous city deserted; </t><t>the hill and the watchtower </t><t>will become dens forever, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>a joy of wild donkeys, </t><t>a pasture of flocks;</t>
Isaiah 32-15 <t>until <f>ⓢ</f>the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, </t><t>and the fruitful field is deemed a forest.</t>
Isaiah 32-16 <t>Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, </t><t>and righteousness abide in the fruitful field.</t>
Isaiah 32-17 <t><f>ⓤ</f> And the effect of righteousness will be peace, </t><t>and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust <f>[1]</f> forever.</t>
Isaiah 32-18 <t>My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, </t><t>in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.</t>
Isaiah 32-19 <t><f>ⓥ</f> And it will hail when the forest falls down, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>and the city will be utterly laid low.</t>
Isaiah 32-20 <t><f>ⓧ</f> Happy are you who sow beside all waters, </t><t>who let the feet of the ox and the donkey range free. </t>
