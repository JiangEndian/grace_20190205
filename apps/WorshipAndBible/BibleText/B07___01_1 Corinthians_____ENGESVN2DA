1 Corinthians 1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>called <f>ⓑ</f>by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,
1 Corinthians 1-2 <pb/>To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those <f>ⓒ</f>sanctified in Christ Jesus, <f>ⓓ</f>called to be saints together with all those who in every place <f>ⓔ</f>call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:
1 Corinthians 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians 1-4 <pb/>I <f>ⓖ</f>give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus,
1 Corinthians 1-5 that in every way <f>ⓗ</f>you were enriched in him in all <f>ⓘ</f>speech and all knowledge —
1 Corinthians 1-6 even as <f>ⓙ</f>the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you —
1 Corinthians 1-7 so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you <f>ⓚ</f>wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Corinthians 1-8 <f>ⓛ</f> who will sustain you to the end, <f>ⓜ</f>guiltless <f>ⓝ</f>in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians 1-9 <f>ⓞ</f> God is faithful, by whom you were called into the <f>ⓟ</f>fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 Corinthians 1-10 <pb/>I appeal to you, brothers, <f>[1]</f> by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no <f>ⓠ</f>divisions among you, but that you be united <f>ⓡ</f>in the same mind and the same judgment.
1 Corinthians 1-11 For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is <f>ⓢ</f>quarreling among you, my brothers.
1 Corinthians 1-12 What I mean is that <f>ⓣ</f>each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow <f>ⓤ</f>Apollos,” or “I follow <f>ⓥ</f>Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”
1 Corinthians 1-13 <f>ⓦ</f> Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you <f>ⓧ</f>baptized in the name of Paul?
1 Corinthians 1-14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except <f>ⓨ</f>Crispus and <f>ⓩ</f>Gaius,
1 Corinthians 1-15 so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name.
1 Corinthians 1-16 (I did baptize also <f>ⓐ</f>the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)
1 Corinthians 1-17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and <f>ⓑ</f>not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
1 Corinthians 1-18 <pb/>For the word of the cross is <f>ⓒ</f>folly to <f>ⓓ</f>those who are perishing, but to us <f>ⓔ</f>who are being saved it is <f>ⓕ</f>the power of God.
1 Corinthians 1-19 For it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, </t><t>and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.” </t>
1 Corinthians 1-20 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? <f>ⓘ</f>Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
1 Corinthians 1-21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach <f>[2]</f> to save those who believe.
1 Corinthians 1-22 For <f>ⓙ</f>Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
1 Corinthians 1-23 but we preach Christ <f>ⓚ</f>crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,
1 Corinthians 1-24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ <f>ⓛ</f>the power of God and <f>ⓜ</f>the wisdom of God.
1 Corinthians 1-25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians 1-26 <pb/>For consider your calling, brothers: <f>ⓝ</f>not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, <f>[3]</f> not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
1 Corinthians 1-27 But <f>ⓞ</f>God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; <f>ⓟ</f>God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
1 Corinthians 1-28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even <f>ⓠ</f>things that are not, to <f>ⓡ</f>bring to nothing things that are,
1 Corinthians 1-29 so <f>ⓢ</f>that no human being <f>[4]</f> might boast in the presence of God.
1 Corinthians 1-30 And because of him <f>[5]</f> you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us <f>ⓣ</f>wisdom from God, <f>ⓤ</f>righteousness and <f>ⓥ</f>sanctification and <f>ⓦ</f>redemption,
1 Corinthians 1-31 so that, as it is written, <f>ⓧ</f>“Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
