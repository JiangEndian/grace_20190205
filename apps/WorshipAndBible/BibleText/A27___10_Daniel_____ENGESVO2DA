Daniel 10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, <f>ⓑ</f>who was named Belteshazzar. And <f>ⓒ</f>the word was true, and it was a great conflict. <f>[1]</f> And <f>ⓓ</f>he understood the word and <f>ⓔ</f>had understanding of the vision.
Daniel 10-2 <pb/>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for <f>ⓕ</f>three weeks.
Daniel 10-3 I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I <f>ⓖ</f>anoint myself at all, for <f>ⓗ</f>the full three weeks.
Daniel 10-4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing <f>ⓘ</f>on the bank of the great river (<f>ⓙ</f>that is, the Tigris)
Daniel 10-5 <f>ⓚ</f> I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, <f>ⓛ</f>a man clothed in linen, <f>ⓜ</f>with a belt of fine <f>ⓝ</f>gold from Uphaz around his waist.
Daniel 10-6 His body was like <f>ⓞ</f>beryl, his face <f>ⓟ</f>like the appearance of lightning, <f>ⓠ</f>his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and <f>ⓡ</f>legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and <f>ⓢ</f>the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude.
Daniel 10-7 <f>ⓣ</f> And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
Daniel 10-8 So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and <f>ⓤ</f>no strength was left in me. My radiant appearance was fearfully changed, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>and I retained no strength.
Daniel 10-9 Then I heard the sound of his words, <f>ⓦ</f>and as I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in deep sleep <f>ⓧ</f>with my face to the ground.
Daniel 10-10 <pb/>And behold, <f>ⓨ</f>a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
Daniel 10-11 And he said to me, “O Daniel, <f>ⓩ</f>man greatly loved, <f>ⓐ</f>understand the words that I speak to you, and <f>ⓑ</f>stand upright, for <f>ⓒ</f>now I have been sent to you.” And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.
Daniel 10-12 Then he said to me, <f>ⓓ</f>“Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you <f>ⓔ</f>set your heart to understand and <f>ⓕ</f>humbled yourself before your God, <f>ⓖ</f>your words have been heard, <f>ⓗ</f>and I have come because of your words.
Daniel 10-13 <f>ⓘ</f> The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me <f>ⓙ</f>twenty-one days, but <f>ⓚ</f>Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I was left there with the kings of Persia,
Daniel 10-14 <f>ⓛ</f> and came to make you understand what is to happen to your people <f>ⓜ</f>in the latter days. For <f>ⓝ</f>the vision is for days yet to come.”
Daniel 10-15 <pb/>When he had spoken to me according to these words, <f>ⓞ</f>I turned my face toward the ground <f>ⓟ</f>and was mute.
Daniel 10-16 And behold, <f>ⓠ</f>one in the likeness of the children of man <f>ⓡ</f>touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, “O my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and <f>ⓢ</f>I retain no strength.
Daniel 10-17 How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me.”
Daniel 10-18 <pb/>Again <f>ⓣ</f>one having the appearance of a man <f>ⓤ</f>touched me and strengthened me.
Daniel 10-19 And he said, <f>ⓥ</f>“O man greatly loved, <f>ⓦ</f>fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage.” And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”
Daniel 10-20 Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will return to fight against the <f>ⓧ</f>prince of Persia; and when I go out, behold, the prince of <f>ⓨ</f>Greece will come.
Daniel 10-21 But I will tell you <f>ⓩ</f>what is inscribed in the book of truth: there is none who contends by my side against these except <f>ⓐ</f>Michael, your prince.
