Galatians 4-1 <pb/>I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, <f>[1]</f> though he is the owner of everything,
Galatians 4-2 but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.
Galatians 4-3 In the same way we also, when we were children, <f>ⓐ</f>were enslaved to the elementary principles <f>[2]</f> of the world.
Galatians 4-4 But <f>ⓑ</f>when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, <f>ⓒ</f>born <f>ⓓ</f>of woman, born <f>ⓔ</f>under the law,
Galatians 4-5 <f>ⓕ</f> to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive <f>ⓖ</f>adoption as sons.
Galatians 4-6 And because you are sons, God has sent <f>ⓗ</f>the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”
Galatians 4-7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then <f>ⓘ</f>an heir through God.
Galatians 4-8 <pb/>Formerly, when you <f>ⓙ</f>did not know God, you <f>ⓚ</f>were enslaved to those that by nature <f>ⓛ</f>are not gods.
Galatians 4-9 But now that you have come to know God, or rather <f>ⓜ</f>to be known by God, <f>ⓝ</f>how can you turn back again to <f>ⓞ</f>the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?
Galatians 4-10 <f>ⓟ</f> You observe days and months and seasons and years!
Galatians 4-11 I am afraid <f>ⓠ</f>I may have labored over you in vain.
Galatians 4-12 <pb/>Brothers, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. <f>ⓢ</f>You did me no wrong.
Galatians 4-13 You know it was <f>ⓣ</f>because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you <f>ⓤ</f>at first,
Galatians 4-14 and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me <f>ⓥ</f>as an angel of God, <f>ⓦ</f>as Christ Jesus.
Galatians 4-15 What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.
Galatians 4-16 Have I then become your enemy by <f>ⓧ</f>telling you the truth? <f>[4]</f>
Galatians 4-17 They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them.
Galatians 4-18 It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and <f>ⓨ</f>not only when I am present with you,
Galatians 4-19 <f>ⓩ</f> my little children, <f>ⓐ</f>for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ <f>ⓑ</f>is formed in you!
Galatians 4-20 I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
Galatians 4-21 <pb/>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
Galatians 4-22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, <f>ⓒ</f>one by a slave woman and <f>ⓓ</f>one by a free woman.
Galatians 4-23 But <f>ⓔ</f>the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while <f>ⓕ</f>the son of the free woman was born through promise.
Galatians 4-24 Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two <f>ⓖ</f>covenants. <f>ⓗ</f>One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
Galatians 4-25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; <f>[5]</f> she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
Galatians 4-26 But <f>ⓘ</f>the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
Galatians 4-27 For it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; </t><t>break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! </t><t>For the children of the desolate one will be more </t><t>than those of the one who has a husband.” </t>
Galatians 4-28 <pb/>Now you, <f>[6]</f> brothers, <f>ⓚ</f>like Isaac, <f>ⓛ</f>are children of promise.
Galatians 4-29 But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh <f>ⓜ</f>persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, <f>ⓝ</f>so also it is now.
Galatians 4-30 But what does the Scripture say? <f>ⓞ</f>“Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”
Galatians 4-31 So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but <f>ⓟ</f>of the free woman.
