Ezekiel 9-1 <pb/>Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Bring near the executioners of the city, <f>ⓐ</f>each with his destroying weapon in his hand.”
Ezekiel 9-2 And behold, six men came from the direction of <f>ⓑ</f>the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was <f>ⓒ</f>a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. And they went in and stood beside <f>ⓓ</f>the bronze altar.
Ezekiel 9-3 <pb/>Now <f>ⓔ</f>the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to <f>ⓕ</f>the threshold of the house. And he called to <f>ⓖ</f>the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist.
Ezekiel 9-4 And the LORD said to him, “Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and <f>ⓗ</f>put a mark on the foreheads of the men who <f>ⓘ</f>sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it.”
Ezekiel 9-5 And to <f>ⓙ</f>the others he said in my hearing, “Pass through the city after him, and strike. <f>ⓚ</f>Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.
Ezekiel 9-6 <f>ⓛ</f> Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but <f>ⓜ</f>touch no one on whom is the mark. And <f>ⓝ</f>begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the house.
Ezekiel 9-7 Then he said to them, <f>ⓞ</f>“Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out.” So they went out and struck in the city.
Ezekiel 9-8 And while they were striking, and I was left alone, <f>ⓟ</f>I fell upon my face, and cried, <f>ⓠ</f>“Ah, Lord GOD! <f>ⓡ</f>Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel <f>ⓢ</f>in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”
Ezekiel 9-9 <pb/>Then he said to me, <f>ⓣ</f>“The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. <f>ⓤ</f>The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For <f>ⓥ</f>they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.’
Ezekiel 9-10 As for me, <f>ⓦ</f>my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; <f>ⓧ</f>I will bring their deeds upon their heads.”
Ezekiel 9-11 <pb/>And behold, <f>ⓨ</f>the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded me.”
