1 Corinthians 2-1 <pb/>And I, when I came to you, brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>did not come proclaiming to you <f>ⓑ</f>the testimony <f>[2]</f> of God with lofty speech or wisdom.
1 Corinthians 2-2 For I decided to know nothing among you except <f>ⓒ</f>Jesus Christ and him crucified.
1 Corinthians 2-3 And <f>ⓓ</f>I was with you <f>ⓔ</f>in weakness and in fear and much trembling,
1 Corinthians 2-4 and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of <f>ⓕ</f>the Spirit and of power,
1 Corinthians 2-5 so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men <f>[3]</f> but <f>ⓖ</f>in the power of God.
1 Corinthians 2-6 <pb/>Yet among <f>ⓗ</f>the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not <f>ⓘ</f>a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, <f>ⓙ</f>who are doomed to pass away.
1 Corinthians 2-7 But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, <f>ⓚ</f>which God decreed before the ages for our glory.
1 Corinthians 2-8 None of <f>ⓛ</f>the rulers of this age understood this, for <f>ⓜ</f>if they had, they would not have crucified <f>ⓝ</f>the Lord of glory.
1 Corinthians 2-9 But, as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, </t><t>nor the heart of man imagined, </t><t>what God has <f>ⓟ</f>prepared <f>ⓠ</f>for those who love him” — </t>
1 Corinthians 2-10 <pb/>these things <f>ⓡ</f>God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even <f>ⓢ</f>the depths of God.
1 Corinthians 2-11 For who knows a person's thoughts <f>ⓣ</f>except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians 2-12 Now <f>ⓤ</f>we have received not <f>ⓥ</f>the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.
1 Corinthians 2-13 And we impart this <f>ⓦ</f>in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, <f>ⓧ</f>interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. <f>[4]</f>
1 Corinthians 2-14 <pb/>The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are <f>ⓨ</f>folly to him, and <f>ⓩ</f>he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
1 Corinthians 2-15 The <f>ⓐ</f>spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.
1 Corinthians 2-16 <f>ⓑ</f> “For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But <f>ⓒ</f>we have the mind of Christ.
