John 13-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>before <f>ⓑ</f>the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that <f>ⓒ</f>his hour had come <f>ⓓ</f>to depart out of this world to the Father, <f>ⓔ</f>having loved <f>ⓕ</f>his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
John 13-2 During supper, when <f>ⓖ</f>the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,
John 13-3 Jesus, knowing <f>ⓗ</f>that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that <f>ⓘ</f>he had come from God and <f>ⓙ</f>was going back to God,
John 13-4 rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, <f>ⓚ</f>tied it around his waist.
John 13-5 Then he <f>ⓛ</f>poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
John 13-6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”
John 13-7 <f>ⓜ</f> Jesus answered him, <J>“What I am doing <f>ⓝ</f>you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.”</J>
John 13-8 <f>ⓞ</f> Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.”</J>
John 13-9 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!”
John 13-10 Jesus said to him, <J>“The one who has bathed does not need to wash, <f>ⓠ</f>except for his feet, <f>[1]</f> but is completely clean. And <f>ⓡ</f>you <f>[2]</f> are clean, <f>ⓢ</f>but not every one of you.”</J>
John 13-11 <f>ⓣ</f> For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, <J>“Not all of you are clean.”</J>
John 13-12 <pb/>When he had washed their feet and <f>ⓤ</f>put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“Do you understand what I have done to you?</J>
John 13-13 <J><f>ⓦ</f> You call me <f>ⓧ</f>Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</J>
John 13-14 <J>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, <f>ⓨ</f>you also ought to wash one another's feet.</J>
John 13-15 <J>For I have given you an example, <f>ⓩ</f>that you also should do just as I have done to you.</J>
John 13-16 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓐ</f>a servant <f>[3]</f> is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</J>
John 13-17 <J>If you know these things, <f>ⓑ</f>blessed are you if you do them.</J>
John 13-18 <J><f>ⓒ</f> I am not speaking of all of you; I know <f>ⓓ</f>whom I have chosen. But <f>ⓔ</f>the Scripture will be fulfilled, <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>‘He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.’</J>
John 13-19 <J><f>ⓖ</f> I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.</J>
John 13-20 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓗ</f>whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.”</J>
John 13-21 <pb/>After saying these things, <f>ⓘ</f>Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓚ</f>one of you will betray me.”</J>
John 13-22 <f>ⓛ</f> The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.
John 13-23 <f>ⓜ</f> One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table <f>ⓝ</f>at Jesus' side, <f>[5]</f>
John 13-24 so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus <f>[6]</f> of whom he was speaking.
John 13-25 <f>ⓞ</f> So that disciple, <f>ⓟ</f>leaning back against Jesus, said to him, “Lord, who is it?”
John 13-26 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread <f>ⓡ</f>when I have dipped it.”</J> So when he had dipped the morsel, <f>ⓢ</f>he gave it to Judas, <f>ⓣ</f>the son of Simon Iscariot.
John 13-27 Then after he had taken the morsel, <f>ⓤ</f>Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“What you are going to do, do quickly.”</J>
John 13-28 Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.
John 13-29 Some thought that, <f>ⓦ</f>because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need <f>ⓧ</f>for the feast,” or that he should <f>ⓨ</f>give something to the poor.
John 13-30 So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. <f>ⓩ</f>And it was night.
John 13-31 <pb/>When he had gone out, Jesus said, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“Now is the Son of Man glorified, and <f>ⓑ</f>God is glorified in him.</J>
John 13-32 <J>If God is glorified in him, <f>ⓒ</f>God will also glorify him in himself, and <f>ⓓ</f>glorify him at once.</J>
John 13-33 <J>Little children, <f>ⓔ</f>yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just <f>ⓕ</f>as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’</J>
John 13-34 <J><f>ⓖ</f> A new commandment <f>ⓗ</f>I give to you, <f>ⓘ</f>that you love one another: <f>ⓙ</f>just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.</J>
John 13-35 <J><f>ⓚ</f> By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</J>
John 13-36 <pb/>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” <f>ⓛ</f>Jesus answered him, <J>“Where I am going <f>ⓜ</f>you cannot follow me now, <f>ⓝ</f>but you will follow afterward.”</J>
John 13-37 <f>ⓞ</f> Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
John 13-38 Jesus answered, <J>“Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓟ</f>the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.</J>
