John 17-1 <pb/>When Jesus had spoken these words, <f>ⓐ</f>he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, <J>“Father, <f>ⓑ</f>the hour has come; <f>ⓒ</f>glorify your Son that the Son may <f>ⓓ</f>glorify you,</J>
John 17-2 <J>since <f>ⓔ</f>you have given him authority over all flesh, <f>ⓕ</f>to give eternal life to all <f>ⓖ</f>whom you have given him.</J>
John 17-3 <J><f>ⓗ</f> And this is eternal life, <f>ⓘ</f>that they know you, <f>ⓙ</f>the only <f>ⓚ</f>true God, and <f>ⓛ</f>Jesus Christ whom you have sent.</J>
John 17-4 <J>I <f>ⓜ</f>glorified you on earth, <f>ⓝ</f>having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.</J>
John 17-5 <J>And now, Father, <f>ⓞ</f>glorify me in your own presence with the glory <f>ⓟ</f>that I had with you <f>ⓠ</f>before the world existed.</J>
John 17-6 <pb/><J><f>ⓡ</f> “I have manifested your name to the people <f>ⓢ</f>whom you gave me out of the world. <f>ⓣ</f>Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.</J>
John 17-7 <J>Now they know that everything <f>ⓤ</f>that you have given me is from you.</J>
John 17-8 <J>For I have given them <f>ⓥ</f>the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that <f>ⓦ</f>I came from you; and <f>ⓧ</f>they have believed that you sent me.</J>
John 17-9 <J>I am praying for them. <f>ⓨ</f>I am not praying for the world but for those <f>ⓩ</f>whom you have given me, for <f>ⓐ</f>they are yours.</J>
John 17-10 <J><f>ⓑ</f> All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and <f>ⓒ</f>I am glorified in them.</J>
John 17-11 <J>And I am no longer in the world, but <f>ⓓ</f>they are in the world, and <f>ⓔ</f>I am coming to you. <f>ⓕ</f>Holy Father, <f>ⓖ</f>keep them in your name, <f>ⓗ</f>which you have given me, <f>ⓘ</f>that they may be one, <f>ⓙ</f>even as we are one.</J>
John 17-12 <J><f>ⓚ</f> While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have <f>ⓛ</f>guarded them, and <f>ⓜ</f>not one of them has been lost except <f>ⓝ</f>the son of destruction, <f>ⓞ</f>that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</J>
John 17-13 <J>But now <f>ⓟ</f>I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have <f>ⓠ</f>my joy fulfilled in themselves.</J>
John 17-14 <J><f>ⓡ</f> I have given them your word, and <f>ⓢ</f>the world has hated them <f>ⓣ</f>because they are not of the world, <f>ⓤ</f>just as I am not of the world.</J>
John 17-15 <J>I <f>ⓥ</f>do not ask that you <f>ⓦ</f>take them out of the world, but that you <f>ⓧ</f>keep them from <f>ⓨ</f>the evil one. <f>[1]</f></J>
John 17-16 <J><f>ⓩ</f> They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</J>
John 17-17 <J><f>ⓐ</f> Sanctify them <f>[2]</f> in the truth; <f>ⓑ</f>your word is truth.</J>
John 17-18 <J><f>ⓒ</f> As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.</J>
John 17-19 <J>And <f>ⓓ</f>for their sake <f>ⓔ</f>I consecrate myself, <f>[3]</f> that they also <f>ⓕ</f>may be sanctified <f>[4]</f> in truth.</J>
John 17-20 <pb/><J>“I do not <f>ⓖ</f>ask for these only, but also for those <f>ⓗ</f>who will believe in me through their word,</J>
John 17-21 <J><f>ⓘ</f> that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that <f>ⓙ</f>they also may be in <f>ⓚ</f>us, so that the world <f>ⓛ</f>may believe that you have sent me.</J>
John 17-22 <J><f>ⓜ</f> The glory that you have given me <f>ⓝ</f>I have given to them, <f>ⓞ</f>that they may be one even as we are one,</J>
John 17-23 <J><f>ⓟ</f> I in them and you in me, <f>ⓠ</f>that they may become perfectly one, <f>ⓡ</f>so that the world may know that you sent me and <f>ⓢ</f>loved them even as <f>ⓣ</f>you loved me.</J>
John 17-24 <J>Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be <f>ⓤ</f>with me <f>ⓥ</f>where I am, <f>ⓦ</f>to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me <f>ⓧ</f>before the foundation of the world.</J>
John 17-25 <J><f>ⓨ</f> O righteous Father, even though <f>ⓩ</f>the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me.</J>
John 17-26 <J><f>ⓐ</f> I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love <f>ⓑ</f>with which you have loved me may be in them, and <f>ⓒ</f>I in them.”</J>
