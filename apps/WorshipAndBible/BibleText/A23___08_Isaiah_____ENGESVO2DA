Isaiah 8-1 <pb/>Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large tablet <f>ⓐ</f>and write on it in common characters, <f>[1]</f> ‘Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.’ <f>[2]</f>
Isaiah 8-2 And <f>ⓑ</f>I will get reliable witnesses, <f>ⓒ</f>Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me.”
Isaiah 8-3 <pb/>And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, <f>ⓓ</f>“Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
Isaiah 8-4 <f>ⓔ</f> for before the boy knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the <f>ⓕ</f>wealth of <f>ⓖ</f>Damascus and the spoil of <f>ⓗ</f>Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”
Isaiah 8-5 <pb/>The LORD spoke to me again:
Isaiah 8-6 “Because this people has refused the waters of <f>ⓘ</f>Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over <f>ⓙ</f>Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
Isaiah 8-7 therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them <f>ⓚ</f>the waters of <f>ⓛ</f>the River, <f>[3]</f> mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it <f>ⓜ</f>will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks,
Isaiah 8-8 and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, <f>ⓝ</f>reaching even to the neck, and its <f>ⓞ</f>outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, <f>ⓟ</f>O Immanuel.”
Isaiah 8-9 <pb/><t>Be broken, <f>[4]</f> you peoples, and <f>ⓠ</f>be shattered; <f>[5]</f> </t><t>give ear, all you far countries; </t><t>strap on your armor and be shattered; </t><t>strap on your armor and be shattered.</t>
Isaiah 8-10 <t>Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing; </t><t>speak a word, <f>ⓡ</f>but it will not stand, </t><t>for God <f>ⓢ</f>is with us. <f>[6]</f> </t>
Isaiah 8-11 <pb/>For the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and <f>ⓣ</f>warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:
Isaiah 8-12 “Do not call <f>ⓤ</f>conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and <f>ⓥ</f>do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.
Isaiah 8-13 But the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓦ</f>him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
Isaiah 8-14 And he will become a <f>ⓧ</f>sanctuary and <f>ⓨ</f>a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Isaiah 8-15 And many <f>ⓩ</f>shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”
Isaiah 8-16 <pb/>Bind up <f>ⓐ</f>the testimony; <f>ⓑ</f>seal the teaching <f>[7]</f> among my disciples.
Isaiah 8-17 I will <f>ⓒ</f>wait for the LORD, who is <f>ⓓ</f>hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.
Isaiah 8-18 <f>ⓔ</f> Behold, I and <f>ⓕ</f>the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
Isaiah 8-19 And when they say to you, “Inquire of the <f>ⓖ</f>mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of <f>ⓗ</f>the dead on behalf of the living?
Isaiah 8-20 <f>ⓘ</f> To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no <f>ⓙ</f>dawn.
Isaiah 8-21 They will pass through the land, <f>[8]</f> greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against <f>[9]</f> their king and their God, and turn their faces upward.
Isaiah 8-22 <f>ⓚ</f> And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into <f>ⓛ</f>thick darkness.
