Romans 6-1 <pb/>What shall we say then? <f>ⓐ</f>Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
Romans 6-2 By no means! How can <f>ⓑ</f>we who died to sin still live in it?
Romans 6-3 Do you not know that all of us <f>ⓒ</f>who have been baptized <f>ⓓ</f>into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
Romans 6-4 We were <f>ⓔ</f>buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as <f>ⓕ</f>Christ was raised from the dead by <f>ⓖ</f>the glory of the Father, we too might walk in <f>ⓗ</f>newness of life.
Romans 6-5 <pb/>For <f>ⓘ</f>if we have been united with him in <f>ⓙ</f>a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
Romans 6-6 We know that <f>ⓚ</f>our old self <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>was crucified with him in order that <f>ⓜ</f>the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
Romans 6-7 For <f>ⓝ</f>one who has died <f>ⓞ</f>has been set free <f>[2]</f> from sin.
Romans 6-8 Now <f>ⓟ</f>if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
Romans 6-9 We know that <f>ⓠ</f>Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; <f>ⓡ</f>death no longer has dominion over him.
Romans 6-10 For the death he died he died to sin, <f>ⓢ</f>once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.
Romans 6-11 So you also must consider yourselves <f>ⓣ</f>dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
Romans 6-12 <pb/>Let not <f>ⓤ</f>sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.
Romans 6-13 <f>ⓥ</f> Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but <f>ⓦ</f>present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.
Romans 6-14 For <f>ⓧ</f>sin <f>ⓨ</f>will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.
Romans 6-15 <pb/>What then? <f>ⓩ</f>Are we to sin <f>ⓐ</f>because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!
Romans 6-16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves <f>ⓑ</f>to anyone as obedient slaves, <f>[3]</f> you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?
Romans 6-17 But <f>ⓒ</f>thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the <f>ⓓ</f>standard of teaching to which you were committed,
Romans 6-18 and, <f>ⓔ</f>having been set free from sin, <f>ⓕ</f>have become slaves of righteousness.
Romans 6-19 <f>ⓖ</f> I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For <f>ⓗ</f>just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members <f>ⓘ</f>as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.
Romans 6-20 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
Romans 6-21 <f>ⓚ</f> But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things <f>ⓛ</f>of which you are now ashamed? <f>ⓜ</f>For the end of those things is death.
Romans 6-22 But now that you <f>ⓝ</f>have been set free from sin and <f>ⓞ</f>have become slaves of God, <f>ⓟ</f>the fruit you get leads to sanctification and <f>ⓠ</f>its end, eternal life.
Romans 6-23 <f>ⓡ</f> For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
