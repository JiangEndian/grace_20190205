Genesis 26-1 <pb/>Now there was a famine in the land, besides <f>ⓐ</f>the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to <f>ⓑ</f>Abimelech king of the <f>ⓒ</f>Philistines.
Genesis 26-2 And the LORD appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; dwell <f>ⓓ</f>in the land of which I shall tell you.
Genesis 26-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Sojourn in this land, and <f>ⓕ</f>I will be with you and will bless you, for <f>ⓖ</f>to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish <f>ⓗ</f>the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.
Genesis 26-4 <f>ⓘ</f> I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And <f>ⓙ</f>in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,
Genesis 26-5 because <f>ⓚ</f>Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”
Genesis 26-6 <pb/>So Isaac settled in Gerar.
Genesis 26-7 When the men of the place asked him about his wife, <f>ⓛ</f>he said, “She is my sister,” for <f>ⓜ</f>he feared to say, “My wife,” thinking, “lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah,” because <f>ⓝ</f>she was attractive in appearance.
Genesis 26-8 When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with <f>[1]</f> Rebekah his wife.
Genesis 26-9 So Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I thought, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”
Genesis 26-10 Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and <f>ⓞ</f>you would have brought guilt upon us.”
Genesis 26-11 So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
Genesis 26-12 <pb/>And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD <f>ⓟ</f>blessed him,
Genesis 26-13 and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy.
Genesis 26-14 He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines <f>ⓠ</f>envied him.
Genesis 26-15 (Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells <f>ⓡ</f>that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.)
Genesis 26-16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”
Genesis 26-17 <pb/>So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.
Genesis 26-18 And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And <f>ⓢ</f>he gave them the names that his father had given them.
Genesis 26-19 But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water,
Genesis 26-20 the herdsmen of Gerar <f>ⓣ</f>quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, <f>[2]</f> because they contended with him.
Genesis 26-21 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah. <f>[3]</f>
Genesis 26-22 And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, <f>[4]</f> saying, “For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”
Genesis 26-23 <pb/>From there he went up to Beersheba.
Genesis 26-24 And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, <f>ⓤ</f>“I am the God of Abraham your father. <f>ⓥ</f>Fear not, for <f>ⓦ</f>I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake.”
Genesis 26-25 So he <f>ⓧ</f>built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.
Genesis 26-26 <pb/>When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and <f>ⓨ</f>Phicol the commander of his army,
Genesis 26-27 Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and <f>ⓩ</f>have sent me away from you?”
Genesis 26-28 They said, “We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,
Genesis 26-29 that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. <f>ⓐ</f>You are now the blessed of the LORD.”
Genesis 26-30 So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
Genesis 26-31 In the morning they rose early and <f>ⓑ</f>exchanged oaths. And Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis 26-32 That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, “We have found water.”
Genesis 26-33 He called it Shibah; <f>[5]</f> therefore the name of the city is <f>ⓒ</f>Beersheba to this day.
Genesis 26-34 <pb/>When Esau was forty years old, he took <f>ⓓ</f>Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,
Genesis 26-35 and <f>ⓔ</f>they made life bitter <f>[6]</f> for Isaac and Rebekah.
