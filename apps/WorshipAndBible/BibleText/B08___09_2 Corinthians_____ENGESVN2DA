2 Corinthians 9-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>it is superfluous for me to write to you about <f>ⓑ</f>the ministry for the saints,
2 Corinthians 9-2 for I know your readiness, <f>ⓒ</f>of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready <f>ⓓ</f>since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them.
2 Corinthians 9-3 But <f>ⓔ</f>I am sending <f>[1]</f> the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, <f>ⓕ</f>as I said you would be.
2 Corinthians 9-4 Otherwise, if some Macedonians <f>ⓖ</f>come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated — to say nothing of you — for being so confident.
2 Corinthians 9-5 So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the <f>ⓗ</f>gift <f>[2]</f> you have promised, so that it may be ready <f>ⓘ</f>as a willing gift, <f>ⓙ</f>not as an exaction. <f>[3]</f>
2 Corinthians 9-6 <pb/>The point is this: <f>ⓚ</f>whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully <f>[4]</f> will also reap bountifully.
2 Corinthians 9-7 Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, <f>ⓛ</f>not reluctantly or under compulsion, for <f>ⓜ</f>God loves a cheerful giver.
2 Corinthians 9-8 And <f>ⓝ</f>God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency <f>[5]</f> in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.
2 Corinthians 9-9 As it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>“He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; </t><t>his righteousness endures forever.” </t>
2 Corinthians 9-10 <pb/>He who supplies <f>ⓟ</f>seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and <f>ⓠ</f>increase the harvest of your righteousness.
2 Corinthians 9-11 <f>ⓡ</f> You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which <f>ⓢ</f>through us will produce thanksgiving to God.
2 Corinthians 9-12 For the ministry of this service is not only supplying <f>ⓣ</f>the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.
2 Corinthians 9-13 By their approval of this service, <f>ⓤ</f>they <f>[6]</f> will glorify God because of your submission that comes from your <f>ⓥ</f>confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others,
2 Corinthians 9-14 while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you.
2 Corinthians 9-15 <f>ⓦ</f> Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
