Isaiah 66-4 <t><f>ⓗ</f> I also will choose harsh treatment for them </t><t>and bring <f>ⓘ</f>their fears upon them, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>because when I called, no one answered, </t><t>when I spoke, they did not listen; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>but they did what was evil in my eyes </t><t>and chose that in which I did not delight.” </t>

Isaiah 66-9 <t>Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth?” </t><t>says the LORD; </t><t>“shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb?” </t><t>says your God. </t>

Isaiah 66-16 <t>For <f>ⓧ</f>by fire <f>ⓨ</f>will the LORD enter into judgment, </t><t>and by his sword, with all flesh; </t><t>and those slain by the LORD shall be many. </t>
