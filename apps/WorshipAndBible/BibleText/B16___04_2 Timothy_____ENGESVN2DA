2 Timothy 4-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>who is to judge the living and the dead, and by <f>ⓒ</f>his appearing and his kingdom:
2 Timothy 4-2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; <f>ⓓ</f>reprove, rebuke, and <f>ⓔ</f>exhort, with complete patience and teaching.
2 Timothy 4-3 <f>ⓕ</f> For the time is coming when people will not endure <f>ⓖ</f>sound <f>[1]</f> teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions,
2 Timothy 4-4 and <f>ⓗ</f>will turn away from listening to the truth and <f>ⓘ</f>wander off into myths.
2 Timothy 4-5 As for you, <f>ⓙ</f>always be sober-minded, <f>ⓚ</f>endure suffering, do the work of <f>ⓛ</f>an evangelist, <f>ⓜ</f>fulfill your ministry.
2 Timothy 4-6 <pb/>For <f>ⓝ</f>I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my <f>ⓞ</f>departure has come.
2 Timothy 4-7 <f>ⓟ</f> I have fought the good fight, <f>ⓠ</f>I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
2 Timothy 4-8 Henceforth there is <f>ⓡ</f>laid up for me <f>ⓢ</f>the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, <f>ⓣ</f>the righteous judge, will award to me on <f>ⓤ</f>that day, and not only to me but also to all <f>ⓥ</f>who have loved his appearing.
2 Timothy 4-9 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Do your best to come to me soon.
2 Timothy 4-10 For <f>ⓧ</f>Demas, <f>ⓨ</f>in love with <f>ⓩ</f>this present world, <f>ⓐ</f>has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>Titus to Dalmatia.
2 Timothy 4-11 <f>ⓒ</f> Luke alone is with me. Get <f>ⓓ</f>Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry.
2 Timothy 4-12 <f>ⓔ</f> Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy 4-13 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.
2 Timothy 4-14 <f>ⓕ</f> Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; <f>ⓖ</f>the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
2 Timothy 4-15 Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message.
2 Timothy 4-16 At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. <f>ⓗ</f>May it not be charged against them!
2 Timothy 4-17 But <f>ⓘ</f>the Lord stood by me and <f>ⓙ</f>strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and <f>ⓚ</f>all the Gentiles might hear it. So <f>ⓛ</f>I was rescued <f>ⓜ</f>from the lion's mouth.
2 Timothy 4-18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. <f>ⓝ</f>To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy 4-19 <pb/>Greet <f>ⓞ</f>Prisca and Aquila, and <f>ⓟ</f>the household of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy 4-20 Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left <f>ⓠ</f>Trophimus, who was ill, at Miletus.
2 Timothy 4-21 <f>ⓡ</f> Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers. <f>[3]</f>
2 Timothy 4-22 <pb/>The Lord be <f>ⓢ</f>with your spirit. <f>ⓣ</f>Grace be with you. <f>[4]</f>
