Galatians 1-1 <pb/>Paul, an <f>ⓐ</f>apostle — <f>ⓑ</f>not from men nor through man, but <f>ⓒ</f>through Jesus Christ and God the Father, <f>ⓓ</f>who raised him from the dead —
Galatians 1-2 and all <f>ⓔ</f>the brothers <f>[1]</f> who are with me, <pb/>To <f>ⓕ</f>the churches of Galatia:
Galatians 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Grace to you and peace <f>ⓗ</f>from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians 1-4 <f>ⓘ</f> who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present <f>ⓙ</f>evil age, according to the will of <f>ⓚ</f>our God and Father,
Galatians 1-5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Galatians 1-6 <pb/>I am astonished that you are <f>ⓛ</f>so quickly deserting <f>ⓜ</f>him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to <f>ⓝ</f>a different gospel —
Galatians 1-7 <f>ⓞ</f> not that there is another one, but <f>ⓟ</f>there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
Galatians 1-8 But even if we or <f>ⓠ</f>an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, <f>ⓡ</f>let him be accursed.
Galatians 1-9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, <f>ⓢ</f>let him be accursed.
Galatians 1-10 <pb/>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying <f>ⓣ</f>to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a <f>ⓤ</f>servant <f>[2]</f> of Christ.
Galatians 1-11 <pb/>For <f>ⓥ</f>I would have you know, brothers, that <f>ⓦ</f>the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. <f>[3]</f>
Galatians 1-12 <f>ⓧ</f> For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it <f>ⓨ</f>through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
Galatians 1-13 For you have heard of <f>ⓩ</f>my former life in Judaism, how <f>ⓐ</f>I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it.
Galatians 1-14 And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely <f>ⓑ</f>zealous was I for <f>ⓒ</f>the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians 1-15 But when he <f>ⓓ</f>who had set me apart <f>ⓔ</f>before I was born, <f>[4]</f> and who <f>ⓕ</f>called me by his grace,
Galatians 1-16 was pleased to reveal his Son to <f>[5]</f> me, in order <f>ⓖ</f>that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; <f>[6]</f>
Galatians 1-17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
Galatians 1-18 <pb/>Then <f>ⓗ</f>after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days.
Galatians 1-19 But I saw none of the other apostles except James <f>ⓘ</f>the Lord's brother.
Galatians 1-20 (In what I am writing to you, <f>ⓙ</f>before God, I do not lie!)
Galatians 1-21 <f>ⓚ</f> Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians 1-22 And I was still unknown in person to <f>ⓛ</f>the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
Galatians 1-23 They only were hearing it said, “He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
Galatians 1-24 And they glorified God because of me.
