Zechariah 11-1 <pb/><t>Open your doors, <f>ⓐ</f>O Lebanon, </t><t>that the fire may devour your cedars!</t>
Zechariah 11-2 <t>Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, </t><t>for the glorious trees are ruined! </t><t>Wail, <f>ⓑ</f>oaks of Bashan, </t><t>for the thick forest has been felled!</t>
Zechariah 11-3 <t>The sound of <f>ⓒ</f>the wail of <f>ⓓ</f>the shepherds, </t><t>for their glory is ruined! </t><t>The sound of the roar of <f>ⓔ</f>the lions, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>for the thicket of the Jordan is ruined! </t>
Zechariah 11-4 <pb/>Thus said the LORD my God: <f>ⓖ</f>“Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter.
Zechariah 11-5 <f>ⓗ</f> Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the LORD, <f>ⓘ</f>I have become rich,’ and their own shepherds have no pity on them.
Zechariah 11-6 For <f>ⓙ</f>I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the LORD. Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor, and each into the hand of his king, and they shall crush the land, and I will deliver none from their hand.”
Zechariah 11-7 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named <f>ⓛ</f>Favor, the other I named <f>ⓜ</f>Union. <f>ⓝ</f>And I tended the sheep.
Zechariah 11-8 In one month <f>ⓞ</f>I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me.
Zechariah 11-9 So I said, “I will not be your shepherd. <f>ⓟ</f>What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another.”
Zechariah 11-10 And I took <f>ⓠ</f>my staff Favor, and I broke it, annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples.
Zechariah 11-11 So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD.
Zechariah 11-12 Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” And they weighed out as my wages <f>ⓡ</f>thirty pieces of silver.
Zechariah 11-13 Then the LORD said to me, “Throw it to the potter” — <f>ⓢ</f>the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the <f>ⓣ</f>thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter.
Zechariah 11-14 Then I broke <f>ⓤ</f>my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah 11-15 <pb/>Then the LORD said to me, “Take once more the equipment of <f>ⓥ</f>a foolish shepherd.
Zechariah 11-16 For behold, I am raising up in the land a shepherd <f>ⓦ</f>who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but <f>ⓧ</f>devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs.
Zechariah 11-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓨ</f> “Woe to my worthless shepherd, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>who deserts the flock! </t><t>May the sword strike his arm </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>his right eye! </t><t>Let his arm be wholly withered, </t><t>his right eye utterly blinded!” </t>
