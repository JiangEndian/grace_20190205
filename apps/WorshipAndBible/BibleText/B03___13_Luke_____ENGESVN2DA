Luke 13-1 <pb/>There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood <f>ⓐ</f>Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
Luke 13-2 And he answered them, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way?</J>
Luke 13-3 <J>No, I tell you; but unless you <f>ⓒ</f>repent, you will all likewise perish.</J>
Luke 13-4 <J>Or those eighteen on whom the tower in <f>ⓓ</f>Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem?</J>
Luke 13-5 <J>No, I tell you; but unless you <f>ⓔ</f>repent, you will all likewise perish.”</J>
Luke 13-6 <pb/>And he told this parable: <J>“A man had <f>ⓕ</f>a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.</J>
Luke 13-7 <J>And he said to the vinedresser, ‘Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. <f>ⓖ</f>Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?’</J>
Luke 13-8 <J>And he answered him, ‘Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.</J>
Luke 13-9 <J>Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.’”</J>
Luke 13-10 <pb/>Now <f>ⓗ</f>he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
Luke 13-11 And behold, there was a woman who had had <f>ⓘ</f>a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself.
Luke 13-12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, <J>“Woman, you are freed from your disability.”</J>
Luke 13-13 And he <f>ⓙ</f>laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she <f>ⓚ</f>glorified God.
Luke 13-14 But <f>ⓛ</f>the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus <f>ⓜ</f>had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, <f>ⓝ</f>“There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.”
Luke 13-15 Then the Lord answered him, <J>“You hypocrites! <f>ⓞ</f>Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?</J>
Luke 13-16 <J>And ought not this woman, <f>ⓟ</f>a daughter of Abraham whom <f>ⓠ</f>Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?”</J>
Luke 13-17 As he said these things, <f>ⓡ</f>all his adversaries were put to shame, and <f>ⓢ</f>all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.
Luke 13-18 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> He said therefore, <J>“What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?</J>
Luke 13-19 <J>It is like <f>ⓤ</f>a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.”</J>
Luke 13-20 <pb/>And again he said, <J>“To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</J>
Luke 13-21 <J><f>ⓥ</f> It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in <f>ⓦ</f>three measures of flour, until it was <f>ⓧ</f>all leavened.”</J>
Luke 13-22 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and <f>ⓩ</f>journeying toward Jerusalem.
Luke 13-23 And someone said to him, “Lord, <f>ⓐ</f>will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them,
Luke 13-24 <J><f>ⓑ</f> “Strive <f>ⓒ</f>to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.</J>
Luke 13-25 <J><f>ⓓ</f> When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Lord, open to us,’ then he will answer you, <f>ⓕ</f>‘I do not know where you come from.’</J>
Luke 13-26 <J>Then you will begin to say, <f>ⓖ</f>‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’</J>
Luke 13-27 <J>But he will say, ‘I tell you, <f>ⓗ</f>I do not know where you come from. <f>ⓘ</f>Depart from me, all you workers of evil!’</J>
Luke 13-28 <J><f>ⓙ</f> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see <f>ⓚ</f>Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but <f>ⓛ</f>you yourselves cast out.</J>
Luke 13-29 <J>And <f>ⓜ</f>people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and <f>ⓝ</f>recline at table in the kingdom of God.</J>
Luke 13-30 <J>And behold, <f>ⓞ</f>some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”</J>
Luke 13-31 <pb/>At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, “Get away from <f>ⓟ</f>here, for <f>ⓠ</f>Herod wants to kill you.”
Luke 13-32 And he said to them, <J>“Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day <f>ⓡ</f>I finish my course.</J>
Luke 13-33 <J>Nevertheless, <f>ⓢ</f>I <f>ⓣ</f>must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that <f>ⓤ</f>a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.’</J>
Luke 13-34 <J><f>ⓥ</f> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that <f>ⓦ</f>kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! <f>ⓧ</f>How often would I have <f>ⓨ</f>gathered <f>ⓩ</f>your children together <f>ⓐ</f>as a hen gathers her brood <f>ⓑ</f>under her wings, and <f>ⓒ</f>you were not willing!</J>
Luke 13-35 <J>Behold, <f>ⓓ</f>your house is forsaken. And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’”</J>
