Leviticus 12-2 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then <f>ⓐ</f>she shall be unclean seven days. <f>ⓑ</f>As at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean.
Leviticus 12-3 And on the <f>ⓒ</f>eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus 12-4 Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying. She shall not touch anything holy, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.
Leviticus 12-5 But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation. And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying for sixty-six days.
Leviticus 12-6 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> “And when the days of her purifying are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering,
Leviticus 12-7 and he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her. Then she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, either male or female.
Leviticus 12-8 And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take <f>ⓔ</f>two turtledoves or two pigeons, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. <f>ⓖ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.”
