Romans 12-2 <f>ⓓ</f> Do not be conformed to this world, <f>[3]</f> but be transformed by <f>ⓔ</f>the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may <f>ⓕ</f>discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. <f>[4]</f>
Romans 12-3 <pb/>For <f>ⓖ</f>by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you <f>ⓗ</f>not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, <f>ⓘ</f>each according to <f>ⓙ</f>the measure of faith that God has assigned.
Romans 12-4 For <f>ⓚ</f>as in one body we have many members, <f>[5]</f> and the members do not all have the same function,
Romans 12-5 so we, <f>ⓛ</f>though many, <f>ⓜ</f>are one body in Christ, and individually <f>ⓝ</f>members one of another.
Romans 12-6 <f>ⓞ</f> Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if <f>ⓟ</f>prophecy, <f>ⓠ</f>in proportion to our faith;
Romans 12-7 if <f>ⓡ</f>service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching;
Romans 12-8 the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; <f>ⓢ</f>the one who leads, <f>[6]</f> with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with <f>ⓣ</f>cheerfulness.
Romans 12-9 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Let love be genuine. <f>ⓥ</f>Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good.
Romans 12-10 <f>ⓦ</f> Love one another with brotherly affection. <f>ⓧ</f>Outdo one another in showing honor.
Romans 12-11 Do not be slothful in zeal, <f>ⓨ</f>be fervent in spirit, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>serve the Lord.

Romans 12-14 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.
Romans 12-15 <f>ⓖ</f> Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
Romans 12-16 <f>ⓗ</f> Live in harmony with one another. <f>ⓘ</f>Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓙ</f>Never be wise in your own sight.
Romans 12-17 <f>ⓚ</f> Repay no one evil for evil, but <f>ⓛ</f>give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.
Romans 12-18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, <f>ⓜ</f>live peaceably with all.
Romans 12-19 Beloved, <f>ⓝ</f>never avenge yourselves, but leave it <f>[9]</f> to the wrath of God, for it is written, <f>ⓞ</f>“Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”
Romans 12-20 To the contrary, <f>ⓟ</f>“if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.”
Romans 12-21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
