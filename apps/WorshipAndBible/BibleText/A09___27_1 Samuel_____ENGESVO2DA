1 Samuel 27-1 <pb/>Then David said in his heart, “Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand.”
1 Samuel 27-2 So David arose and went over, he and <f>ⓐ</f>the six hundred men who were with him, <f>ⓑ</f>to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
1 Samuel 27-3 And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with <f>ⓒ</f>his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow.
1 Samuel 27-4 And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought him.
1 Samuel 27-5 <pb/>Then David said to Achish, “If <f>ⓓ</f>I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given me in one of the country towns, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”
1 Samuel 27-6 So that day Achish gave him <f>ⓔ</f>Ziklag. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
1 Samuel 27-7 <f>ⓕ</f> And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
1 Samuel 27-8 <pb/>Now David <f>ⓖ</f>and his men went up and made raids against <f>ⓗ</f>the Geshurites, <f>ⓘ</f>the Girzites, and <f>ⓙ</f>the Amalekites, for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old, <f>ⓚ</f>as far as Shur, to the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel 27-9 And David would strike the land and would leave neither man nor woman alive, but would take away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the garments, and come back to Achish.
1 Samuel 27-10 When Achish asked, “Where have you <f>ⓛ</f>made a raid today?” David would say, “Against the Negeb of Judah,” or, “Against the Negeb of <f>ⓜ</f>the Jerahmeelites,” or, “Against the Negeb of <f>ⓝ</f>the Kenites.”
1 Samuel 27-11 And David would leave neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath, thinking, “lest they should tell about us and say, ‘So David has done.’” Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines.
1 Samuel 27-12 And Achish trusted David, thinking, “He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel; therefore he shall always be my servant.”
