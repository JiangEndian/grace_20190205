1 Peter 3-1 <pb/>Likewise, wives, <f>ⓐ</f>be subject to your own husbands, so that <f>ⓑ</f>even if some do not obey the word, <f>ⓒ</f>they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives,
1 Peter 3-2 when they see your <f>ⓓ</f>respectful and pure conduct.
1 Peter 3-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Do not let your adorning be external — the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear —
1 Peter 3-4 but let your adorning be <f>ⓕ</f>the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious.
1 Peter 3-5 For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands,
1 Peter 3-6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, <f>ⓖ</f>calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and <f>ⓗ</f>do not fear anything that is frightening.
1 Peter 3-7 <pb/>Likewise, <f>ⓘ</f>husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker <f>ⓙ</f>vessel, since they are heirs with you <f>[1]</f> of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
1 Peter 3-8 <pb/>Finally, all of you, <f>ⓚ</f>have unity of mind, sympathy, <f>ⓛ</f>brotherly love, <f>ⓜ</f>a tender heart, and <f>ⓝ</f>a humble mind.
1 Peter 3-9 <f>ⓞ</f> Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, <f>ⓟ</f>bless, for <f>ⓠ</f>to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.
1 Peter 3-10 For <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f>“Whoever desires to love life </t><t>and see good days, </t><t>let him keep his tongue from evil </t><t>and his lips from speaking deceit;</t>
1 Peter 3-11 <t>let him turn away from evil and do good; </t><t>let him seek peace and pursue it.</t>
1 Peter 3-12 <t>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, </t><t>and his ears are open to their prayer. </t><t>But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.” </t>
1 Peter 3-13 <pb/>Now <f>ⓢ</f>who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
1 Peter 3-14 <f>ⓣ</f> But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. <f>ⓤ</f>Have no fear of them, <f>ⓥ</f>nor be troubled,
1 Peter 3-15 but <f>ⓦ</f>in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, <f>ⓧ</f>always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and <f>ⓨ</f>respect,
1 Peter 3-16 <f>ⓩ</f> having a good conscience, so that, <f>ⓐ</f>when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
1 Peter 3-17 For <f>ⓑ</f>it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.
1 Peter 3-18 <pb/>For Christ also <f>ⓒ</f>suffered <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, <f>ⓔ</f>that he might bring us to God, being put to death <f>ⓕ</f>in the flesh but made alive <f>ⓖ</f>in the spirit,
1 Peter 3-19 in which <f>[3]</f> he went and <f>ⓗ</f>proclaimed <f>[4]</f> to the spirits in prison,
1 Peter 3-20 because <f>[5]</f> they formerly did not obey, <f>ⓘ</f>when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, <f>ⓙ</f>while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, <f>ⓚ</f>eight persons, were brought safely through water.
1 Peter 3-21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, <f>ⓛ</f>now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but <f>ⓜ</f>as an appeal to God for a good conscience, <f>ⓝ</f>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
1 Peter 3-22 who has gone into heaven and <f>ⓞ</f>is at the right hand of God, <f>ⓟ</f>with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
