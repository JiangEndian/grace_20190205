John 7-1 <pb/>After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because <f>ⓐ</f>the Jews <f>[1]</f> were seeking to kill him.
John 7-2 Now <f>ⓑ</f>the Jews' Feast of <f>ⓒ</f>Booths was at hand.
John 7-3 <f>ⓓ</f> So his brothers <f>[2]</f> said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing.
John 7-4 For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, <f>ⓔ</f>show yourself to the world.”
John 7-5 <f>ⓕ</f> For not even <f>ⓖ</f>his brothers believed in him.
John 7-6 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</J>
John 7-7 <J>The world cannot hate you, but <f>ⓘ</f>it hates me because I testify about it that <f>ⓙ</f>its works are evil.</J>
John 7-8 <J>You go up to the feast. I am not <f>[3]</f> going up to this feast, for <f>ⓚ</f>my time has not yet fully come.”</J>
John 7-9 After saying this, he remained in Galilee.
John 7-10 <pb/>But after <f>ⓛ</f>his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private.
John 7-11 <f>ⓜ</f> The Jews <f>ⓝ</f>were looking for him at the feast, and saying, “Where is he?”
John 7-12 And there was much <f>ⓞ</f>muttering about him among the people. <f>ⓟ</f>While some said, “He is a good man,” others said, “No, <f>ⓠ</f>he is leading the people astray.”
John 7-13 Yet <f>ⓡ</f>for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.
John 7-14 <pb/>About the middle of the feast Jesus went up <f>ⓢ</f>into the temple and began teaching.
John 7-15 The Jews therefore <f>ⓣ</f>marveled, saying, “How is it that this man has learning, <f>[4]</f> when he has never studied?”
John 7-16 So Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“My teaching is not mine, but his <f>ⓥ</f>who sent me.</J>
John 7-17 <J><f>ⓦ</f> If anyone's will is to do God's <f>[5]</f> will, <f>ⓧ</f>he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I <f>ⓨ</f>am speaking on my own authority.</J>
John 7-18 <J>The one who speaks on his own authority <f>ⓩ</f>seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</J>
John 7-19 <J><f>ⓐ</f> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. <f>ⓑ</f>Why do you seek to kill me?”</J>
John 7-20 The crowd answered, <f>ⓒ</f>“You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?”
John 7-21 Jesus answered them, <J>“I did <f>ⓓ</f>one work, and you all marvel at it.</J>
John 7-22 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but <f>ⓕ</f>from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</J>
John 7-23 <J>If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, <f>ⓖ</f>are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</J>
John 7-24 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.”</J>
John 7-25 <pb/>Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, “Is not this the man whom <f>ⓘ</f>they seek to kill?
John 7-26 And here he is, <f>ⓙ</f>speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that <f>ⓚ</f>the authorities really know that this is the Christ?
John 7-27 But <f>ⓛ</f>we know <f>ⓜ</f>where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, <f>ⓝ</f>no one will know where he comes from.”
John 7-28 So Jesus proclaimed, <f>ⓞ</f>as he taught in the temple, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“You know me, and you know where I come from. But <f>ⓠ</f>I have not come of my own accord. <f>ⓡ</f>He who sent me is true, <f>ⓢ</f>and him you do not know.</J>
John 7-29 <J><f>ⓣ</f> I know him, for I come <f>ⓤ</f>from him, and <f>ⓥ</f>he sent me.”</J>
John 7-30 <f>ⓦ</f> So they were seeking to arrest him, but <f>ⓧ</f>no one laid a hand on him, <f>ⓨ</f>because his hour had not yet come.
John 7-31 Yet <f>ⓩ</f>many of the people believed in him. They said, <f>ⓐ</f>“When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?”
John 7-32 <pb/>The Pharisees heard the crowd <f>ⓑ</f>muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent <f>ⓒ</f>officers to arrest him.
John 7-33 Jesus then said, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“I will be with you a little longer, and then <f>ⓔ</f>I am going to him who sent me.</J>
John 7-34 <J><f>ⓕ</f> You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come.”</J>
John 7-35 The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? <f>ⓖ</f>Does he intend to go to <f>ⓗ</f>the Dispersion among <f>ⓘ</f>the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
John 7-36 What does he mean by saying, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>‘You will seek me and you will not find me,’</J> and, <J>‘Where I am you cannot come’</J>?”
John 7-37 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“If anyone thirsts, let him <f>ⓜ</f>come to me and drink.</J>
John 7-38 <J>Whoever believes in me, <f>ⓝ</f>as <f>[6]</f> the Scripture has said, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of <f>ⓟ</f>living water.’”</J>
John 7-39 Now <f>ⓠ</f>this he said about the Spirit, <f>ⓡ</f>whom those who believed in him were to receive, <f>ⓢ</f>for as yet the Spirit had not been <f>ⓣ</f>given, <f>ⓤ</f>because Jesus was not yet glorified.
John 7-40 <pb/>When they heard these words, <f>ⓥ</f>some of the people said, “This really is <f>ⓦ</f>the Prophet.”
John 7-41 Others said, “This is <f>ⓧ</f>the Christ.” But some said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Is the Christ to come from Galilee?
John 7-42 Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes <f>ⓩ</f>from the offspring of David, and comes <f>ⓐ</f>from Bethlehem, the village <f>ⓑ</f>where David was?”
John 7-43 So there was <f>ⓒ</f>a division among the people over him.
John 7-44 <f>ⓓ</f> Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.
John 7-45 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why did you not bring him?”
John 7-46 The officers answered, <f>ⓕ</f>“No one ever spoke like this man!”
John 7-47 The Pharisees answered them, <f>ⓖ</f>“Have you also been deceived?
John 7-48 <f>ⓗ</f> Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him?
John 7-49 But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.”
John 7-50 <f>ⓘ</f> Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them,
John 7-51 <f>ⓙ</f> “Does our law judge a man without first <f>ⓚ</f>giving him a hearing and learning what he does?”
John 7-52 They replied, <f>ⓛ</f>“Are you from Galilee too? Search and see that <f>ⓜ</f>no prophet arises from Galilee.”
