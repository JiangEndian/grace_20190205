John 5-1 <pb/>After this there was a <f>ⓐ</f>feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John 5-2 <pb/>Now there is in Jerusalem by <f>ⓑ</f>the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic <f>[1]</f> called Bethesda, <f>[2]</f> which has five roofed colonnades.
John 5-3 In these lay a multitude of invalids — blind, lame, and <f>ⓒ</f>paralyzed. <f>[3]</f>
John 5-4 
John 5-5 One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
John 5-6 When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, <J>“Do you want to be healed?”</J>
John 5-7 The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.”
John 5-8 Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Get up, take up your bed, and walk.”</J>
John 5-9 <f>ⓔ</f> And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked. <pb/><f>ⓕ</f>Now that day was the Sabbath.
John 5-10 So the Jews <f>[4]</f> said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and <f>ⓖ</f>it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.”
John 5-11 But he answered them, “The man who healed me, that man said to me, <J>‘Take up your bed, and walk.’</J>”
John 5-12 They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?”
John 5-13 Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for <f>ⓗ</f>Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.
John 5-14 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, <J>“See, you are well! <f>ⓘ</f>Sin no more, <f>ⓙ</f>that nothing worse may happen to you.”</J>
John 5-15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.
John 5-16 And this was why the Jews <f>ⓚ</f>were persecuting Jesus, <f>ⓛ</f>because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
John 5-17 But Jesus answered them, <J>“My Father is working until now, and I am working.”</J>
John 5-18 <pb/>This was why the Jews <f>ⓜ</f>were seeking all the more to kill him, <f>ⓝ</f>because not only was he <f>ⓞ</f>breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God <f>ⓟ</f>his own Father, <f>ⓠ</f>making himself equal with God.
John 5-19 <pb/>So Jesus said to them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓡ</f>the Son <f>ⓢ</f>can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father <f>[5]</f> does, that the Son does likewise.</J>
John 5-20 <J>For <f>ⓣ</f>the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And <f>ⓤ</f>greater works than these will he show him, so that <f>ⓥ</f>you may marvel.</J>
John 5-21 <J>For as the Father <f>ⓦ</f>raises the dead and <f>ⓧ</f>gives them life, so <f>ⓨ</f>also the Son gives life <f>ⓩ</f>to whom he will.</J>
John 5-22 <J><f>ⓐ</f> For the Father judges no one, but <f>ⓑ</f>has given all judgment to the Son,</J>
John 5-23 <J>that all may honor the Son, just as they <f>ⓒ</f>honor the Father. <f>ⓓ</f>Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</J>
John 5-24 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓔ</f>whoever hears my word and <f>ⓕ</f>believes him who sent me has eternal life. He <f>ⓖ</f>does not come into judgment, but <f>ⓗ</f>has passed from death to life.</J>
John 5-25 <pb/><J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓘ</f>an hour is coming, and is now here, when <f>ⓙ</f>the dead will hear <f>ⓚ</f>the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear <f>ⓛ</f>will live.</J>
John 5-26 <J><f>ⓜ</f> For as the Father has life in himself, <f>ⓝ</f>so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.</J>
John 5-27 <J>And he <f>ⓞ</f>has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</J>
John 5-28 <J>Do not marvel at this, for <f>ⓟ</f>an hour is coming when <f>ⓠ</f>all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</J>
John 5-29 <J>and come out, <f>ⓡ</f>those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.</J>
John 5-30 <pb/><J><f>ⓢ</f> “I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and <f>ⓣ</f>my judgment is just, because <f>ⓤ</f>I seek not my own will <f>ⓥ</f>but the will of him who sent me.</J>
John 5-31 <J><f>ⓦ</f> If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true.</J>
John 5-32 <J>There is <f>ⓧ</f>another who bears witness about me, and <f>ⓨ</f>I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true.</J>
John 5-33 <J><f>ⓩ</f> You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</J>
John 5-34 <J>Not that <f>ⓐ</f>the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.</J>
John 5-35 <J>He was a burning and <f>ⓑ</f>shining lamp, and <f>ⓒ</f>you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</J>
John 5-36 <J>But <f>ⓓ</f>the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For <f>ⓔ</f>the works that the Father has given me <f>ⓕ</f>to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, <f>ⓖ</f>bear witness about me that <f>ⓗ</f>the Father has sent me.</J>
John 5-37 <J>And the Father who sent me <f>ⓘ</f>has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, <f>ⓙ</f>his form you have never seen,</J>
John 5-38 <J>and <f>ⓚ</f>you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent.</J>
John 5-39 <J><f>ⓛ</f> You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and <f>ⓜ</f>it is they that bear witness about me,</J>
John 5-40 <J>yet <f>ⓝ</f>you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</J>
John 5-41 <J><f>ⓞ</f> I do not receive glory from people.</J>
John 5-42 <J>But <f>ⓟ</f>I know that you do not have <f>ⓠ</f>the love of God within you.</J>
John 5-43 <J>I have come <f>ⓡ</f>in my Father's name, and <f>ⓢ</f>you do not receive me. <f>ⓣ</f>If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.</J>
John 5-44 <J>How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and <f>ⓤ</f>do not seek the glory that comes from <f>ⓥ</f>the only God?</J>
John 5-45 <J>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, <f>ⓦ</f>on whom you have set your hope.</J>
John 5-46 <J>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for <f>ⓧ</f>he wrote of me.</J>
John 5-47 <J>But <f>ⓨ</f>if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?”</J>
