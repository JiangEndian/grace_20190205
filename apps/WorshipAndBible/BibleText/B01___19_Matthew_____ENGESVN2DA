Matthew 19-5 <J>and said, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and <f>ⓘ</f>the two shall become one flesh’?</J>
Matthew 19-6 <J>So they are no longer two but one flesh. <f>ⓙ</f>What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”</J>

Matthew 19-12 <J>For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs <f>ⓠ</f>for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.”</J>
Matthew 19-13 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples <f>ⓢ</f>rebuked the people,

Matthew 19-17 And he said to him, <J>“Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. <f>ⓨ</f>If you would enter life, keep the commandments.”</J>
Matthew 19-18 He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, <J> <f>ⓩ</f>“You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</J>
Matthew 19-19 <J>Honor your father and mother, and, <f>ⓐ</f>You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</J>
Matthew 19-20 The young man said to him, <f>ⓑ</f>“All these I have kept. What do I still lack?”
Matthew 19-21 Jesus said to him, <J>“If you would be <f>ⓒ</f>perfect, go, <f>ⓓ</f>sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have <f>ⓔ</f>treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</J>
Matthew 19-22 <f>ⓕ</f> When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
Matthew 19-23 <pb/>And Jesus said to his disciples, <J>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓖ</f>only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven.</J>
Matthew 19-24 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter <f>ⓘ</f>the kingdom of God.”</J>
Matthew 19-25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”
Matthew 19-26 But Jesus <f>ⓙ</f>looked at them and said, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</J>
