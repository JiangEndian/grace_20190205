Zephaniah 3-1 <pb/><t>Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>the oppressing city!</t>
Zephaniah 3-2 <t>She listens to no voice; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>she accepts no correction. </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>She does not trust in the LORD; </t><t>she does not draw near to her God. </t>
Zephaniah 3-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> Her officials within her </t><t>are roaring lions; </t><t>her judges are <f>ⓔ</f>evening wolves </t><t>that leave nothing till the morning.</t>
Zephaniah 3-4 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Her prophets are fickle, treacherous men; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>her priests <f>ⓗ</f>profane what is holy; </t><t>they do violence to the law.</t>
Zephaniah 3-5 <t>The LORD within her <f>ⓘ</f>is righteous; </t><t>he does no injustice; </t><t>every morning he shows forth his justice; </t><t>each dawn he does not fail; </t><t>but <f>ⓙ</f>the unjust knows no shame. </t>

Zephaniah 3-7 <t><f>ⓜ</f> I said, ‘Surely you will fear me; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>you will accept correction. </t><t>Then your <f>[1]</f> dwelling would not be cut off </t><t>according to all that I have appointed against you.’ <f>[2]</f> </t><t>But <f>ⓞ</f>all the more they were eager </t><t>to make all their deeds corrupt. </t>

Zephaniah 3-9 <pb/><t>“For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples </t><t>to <f>ⓢ</f>a pure speech, </t><t>that all of them may call upon the name of the LORD </t><t>and serve him with one accord.</t>
Zephaniah 3-10 <t><f>ⓣ</f> From beyond the rivers <f>ⓤ</f>of Cush </t><t>my worshipers, the daughter of my dispersed ones, </t><t>shall bring my offering. </t>

Zephaniah 3-13 <t><f>ⓑ</f> those who are left in Israel; </t><t>they <f>ⓒ</f>shall do no injustice </t><t>and speak no lies, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>nor shall there be found in their mouth </t><t>a deceitful tongue. </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>For they shall graze and lie down, </t><t>and none shall make them afraid.” </t>
Zephaniah 3-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion; </t><t>shout, O Israel! </t><t>Rejoice and exult with all your heart, </t><t>O daughter of Jerusalem!</t>
Zephaniah 3-15 <t>The LORD has taken away the judgments against you; </t><t>he has cleared away your enemies. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>The King of Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>the LORD, is in your midst; </t><t>you shall never again fear evil.</t>
