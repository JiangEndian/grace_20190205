Ezekiel 8-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, <f>ⓑ</f>as I sat in my house, with <f>ⓒ</f>the elders of Judah sitting before me, <f>ⓓ</f>the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there.
Ezekiel 8-2 Then I looked, and behold, <f>ⓔ</f>a form that had the appearance of a man. <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like <f>ⓖ</f>gleaming metal. <f>[2]</f>
Ezekiel 8-3 He <f>ⓗ</f>put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up <f>ⓘ</f>between earth and heaven and <f>ⓙ</f>brought me in <f>ⓚ</f>visions of God to Jerusalem, <f>ⓛ</f>to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, <f>ⓜ</f>where was the seat of the <f>ⓝ</f>image of jealousy, <f>ⓞ</f>which provokes to jealousy.
Ezekiel 8-4 And behold, <f>ⓟ</f>the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw <f>ⓠ</f>in the valley.
Ezekiel 8-5 <pb/>Then he said to me, <f>ⓡ</f>“Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of <f>ⓢ</f>the altar gate, in the entrance, was this <f>ⓣ</f>image of jealousy.
Ezekiel 8-6 And he said to me, “Son of man, <f>ⓤ</f>do you see what they are doing, <f>ⓥ</f>the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, <f>ⓦ</f>to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.”
Ezekiel 8-7 <pb/>And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.
Ezekiel 8-8 Then he said to me, “Son of man, <f>ⓧ</f>dig in the wall.” So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance.
Ezekiel 8-9 And he said to me, “Go in, and see <f>ⓨ</f>the vile abominations that they are committing here.”
Ezekiel 8-10 So I went in and saw. And there, <f>ⓩ</f>engraved on the wall all around, was <f>ⓐ</f>every form of <f>ⓑ</f>creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel 8-11 And before them stood <f>ⓒ</f>seventy men of <f>ⓓ</f>the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of <f>ⓔ</f>Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and <f>ⓕ</f>the smoke of the cloud of incense went up.
Ezekiel 8-12 Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing <f>ⓖ</f>in the dark, each <f>ⓗ</f>in his room of pictures? For they say, <f>ⓘ</f>‘The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.’”
Ezekiel 8-13 He said also to me, <f>ⓙ</f>“You will see still greater abominations that they commit.”
Ezekiel 8-14 <pb/>Then he brought me to <f>ⓚ</f>the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
Ezekiel 8-15 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O <f>ⓛ</f>son of man? <f>ⓜ</f>You will see still greater abominations than these.”
Ezekiel 8-16 <pb/>And he brought me into <f>ⓝ</f>the inner court of the house of the LORD. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the LORD, <f>ⓞ</f>between the <f>ⓟ</f>porch and <f>ⓠ</f>the altar, were about twenty-five men, <f>ⓡ</f>with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping <f>ⓢ</f>the sun toward the east.
Ezekiel 8-17 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O <f>ⓣ</f>son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit <f>ⓤ</f>the abominations that they commit here, that <f>ⓥ</f>they should fill the land with violence and <f>ⓦ</f>provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their <f>[3]</f> nose.
Ezekiel 8-18 Therefore <f>ⓧ</f>I will act in wrath. <f>ⓨ</f>My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. <f>ⓩ</f>And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”
