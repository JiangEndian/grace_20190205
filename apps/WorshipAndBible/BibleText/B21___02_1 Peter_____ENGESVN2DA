1 Peter 2-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
1 Peter 2-2 <f>ⓑ</f> Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual <f>ⓒ</f>milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation —
1 Peter 2-3 if indeed you have <f>ⓓ</f>tasted that the Lord is good.
1 Peter 2-4 <pb/>As you come to him, a living stone <f>ⓔ</f>rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious,
1 Peter 2-5 <f>ⓕ</f> you yourselves like living stones are being built up as <f>ⓖ</f>a spiritual house, to be <f>ⓗ</f>a holy priesthood, <f>ⓘ</f>to offer spiritual sacrifices <f>ⓙ</f>acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
1 Peter 2-6 For it stands in Scripture: <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, </t><t>a cornerstone chosen and precious, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” </t>
1 Peter 2-7 <pb/>So the honor is for you who <f>ⓜ</f>believe, but for those who <f>ⓝ</f>do not believe, <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>“The stone that the builders rejected </t><t>has become the cornerstone,” <f>[1]</f> </t>
1 Peter 2-8 <pb/>and <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f>“A stone of stumbling, </t><t>and a rock of offense.” </t> <pb/>They stumble because they disobey the word, <f>ⓠ</f>as they were destined to do.
1 Peter 2-9 <pb/>But you are <f>ⓡ</f>a chosen race, <f>ⓢ</f>a royal <f>ⓣ</f>priesthood, <f>ⓤ</f>a holy nation, <f>ⓥ</f>a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you <f>ⓦ</f>out of darkness into <f>ⓧ</f>his marvelous light.
1 Peter 2-10 <f>ⓨ</f> Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
1 Peter 2-11 <pb/>Beloved, I urge you <f>ⓩ</f>as sojourners and exiles <f>ⓐ</f>to abstain from the passions of the flesh, <f>ⓑ</f>which wage war against your soul.
1 Peter 2-12 <f>ⓒ</f> Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, <f>ⓓ</f>they may see your good deeds and glorify God on <f>ⓔ</f>the day of visitation.
1 Peter 2-13 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, <f>[2]</f> whether it be to the emperor <f>[3]</f> as supreme,
1 Peter 2-14 or to governors as sent by him <f>ⓖ</f>to punish those who do evil and <f>ⓗ</f>to praise those who do good.
1 Peter 2-15 For this is the will of God, <f>ⓘ</f>that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
1 Peter 2-16 <f>ⓙ</f> Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but <f>ⓚ</f>living as servants <f>[4]</f> of God.
1 Peter 2-17 <f>ⓛ</f> Honor everyone. <f>ⓜ</f>Love the brotherhood. <f>ⓝ</f>Fear God. Honor the emperor.
1 Peter 2-18 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.
1 Peter 2-19 For this is a gracious thing, when, <f>ⓟ</f>mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.
1 Peter 2-20 For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But <f>ⓠ</f>if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
1 Peter 2-21 For <f>ⓡ</f>to this you have been called, <f>ⓢ</f>because Christ also suffered for you, <f>ⓣ</f>leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.
1 Peter 2-22 <f>ⓤ</f> He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
1 Peter 2-23 <f>ⓥ</f> When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, <f>ⓦ</f>but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.
1 Peter 2-24 <f>ⓧ</f> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we <f>ⓨ</f>might die to sin and <f>ⓩ</f>live to righteousness. <f>ⓐ</f>By his wounds you have been healed.
1 Peter 2-25 For <f>ⓑ</f>you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to <f>ⓒ</f>the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
