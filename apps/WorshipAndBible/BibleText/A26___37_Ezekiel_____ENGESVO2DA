Ezekiel 37-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The hand of the LORD was upon me, and <f>ⓑ</f>he brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; <f>[1]</f> it was full of bones.
Ezekiel 37-2 And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry.
Ezekiel 37-3 And he said to me, <f>ⓒ</f>“Son of man, <f>ⓓ</f>can these bones live?” And <f>ⓔ</f>I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.”
Ezekiel 37-4 Then he said to me, <f>ⓕ</f>“Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, <f>ⓖ</f>O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.
Ezekiel 37-5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause <f>ⓗ</f>breath <f>[2]</f> to enter you, and you shall live.
Ezekiel 37-6 <f>ⓘ</f> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and <f>ⓙ</f>cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, <f>ⓚ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel 37-7 <pb/>So I prophesied <f>ⓛ</f>as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, <f>ⓜ</f>a rattling, <f>[3]</f> and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
Ezekiel 37-8 And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them. But <f>ⓝ</f>there was no breath in them.
Ezekiel 37-9 Then he said to me, <f>ⓞ</f>“Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, <f>ⓟ</f>son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from <f>ⓠ</f>the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”
Ezekiel 37-10 So I prophesied <f>ⓡ</f>as he commanded me, and <f>ⓢ</f>the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
Ezekiel 37-11 <pb/>Then he said to me, <f>ⓣ</f>“Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and <f>ⓤ</f>our hope is lost; <f>ⓥ</f>we are indeed cut off.’
Ezekiel 37-12 Therefore <f>ⓦ</f>prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, <f>ⓧ</f>I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And <f>ⓨ</f>I will bring you into the land of Israel.
Ezekiel 37-13 And <f>ⓩ</f>you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people.
Ezekiel 37-14 And <f>ⓐ</f>I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; <f>ⓑ</f>I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD.”
Ezekiel 37-15 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 37-16 <f>ⓒ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓓ</f>take a stick <f>[4]</f> and write on it, ‘For <f>ⓔ</f>Judah, and <f>ⓕ</f>the people of Israel associated with him’; then take another stick and write on it, ‘For <f>ⓖ</f>Joseph (the stick of <f>ⓗ</f>Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him.’
Ezekiel 37-17 And <f>ⓘ</f>join them one to another into one stick, that <f>ⓙ</f>they may become <f>ⓚ</f>one in your hand.
Ezekiel 37-18 And when <f>ⓛ</f>your people say to you, <f>ⓜ</f>‘Will you not tell us what you mean by these?’
Ezekiel 37-19 say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take <f>ⓝ</f>the stick of Joseph (that is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him. And I will join with it the <f>ⓞ</f>stick of Judah, <f>[5]</f> and <f>ⓟ</f>make them one stick, <f>ⓠ</f>that they may be one in my hand.
Ezekiel 37-20 When the sticks on which you write are in your hand <f>ⓡ</f>before their eyes,
Ezekiel 37-21 then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, <f>ⓢ</f>I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and <f>ⓣ</f>bring them to their own land.
Ezekiel 37-22 And <f>ⓤ</f>I will make them one nation in the land, on <f>ⓥ</f>the mountains of Israel. And <f>ⓦ</f>one king shall be king over them all, and they shall be no longer <f>ⓧ</f>two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms.
Ezekiel 37-23 <f>ⓨ</f> They shall not <f>ⓩ</f>defile themselves anymore <f>ⓐ</f>with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But <f>ⓑ</f>I will save them from all the backslidings <f>[6]</f> in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and <f>ⓒ</f>they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel 37-24 <pb/>“My servant <f>ⓓ</f>David <f>ⓔ</f>shall be king over them, and they shall all have <f>ⓕ</f>one shepherd. <f>ⓖ</f>They shall walk in my rules and be careful to obey my statutes.
Ezekiel 37-25 <f>ⓗ</f> They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They and their children and their children's children shall dwell there <f>ⓘ</f>forever, and David my servant shall be their prince <f>ⓙ</f>forever.
Ezekiel 37-26 <f>ⓚ</f> I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be <f>ⓛ</f>an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land <f>[7]</f> and <f>ⓜ</f>multiply them, and will <f>ⓝ</f>set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore.
Ezekiel 37-27 <f>ⓞ</f> My dwelling place shall be with them, <f>ⓟ</f>and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Ezekiel 37-28 Then <f>ⓠ</f>the nations will know that <f>ⓡ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when <f>ⓢ</f>my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.”
