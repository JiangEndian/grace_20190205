Hebrews 10-1 <pb/>For since the law has but <f>ⓐ</f>a shadow <f>ⓑ</f>of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, <f>ⓒ</f>it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.
Hebrews 10-2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
Hebrews 10-3 But <f>ⓓ</f>in these sacrifices <f>ⓔ</f>there is a reminder of sins every year.
Hebrews 10-4 For <f>ⓕ</f>it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews 10-5 <pb/>Consequently, <f>ⓖ</f>when Christ <f>[1]</f> came into the world, he said, <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f>“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, </t><t>but a body have you prepared for me;</t>
Hebrews 10-6 <t>in burnt offerings and sin offerings </t><t>you have taken no pleasure.</t>
Hebrews 10-7 <t>Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, </t><t>as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’” </t>
Hebrews 10-8 <pb/>When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in <f>ⓘ</f>sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law),
Hebrews 10-9 then he added, <f>ⓙ</f>“Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second.
Hebrews 10-10 And by that will <f>ⓚ</f>we have been sanctified through the offering of <f>ⓛ</f>the body of Jesus Christ <f>ⓜ</f>once for all.
Hebrews 10-11 <pb/>And every priest stands <f>ⓝ</f>daily at his service, <f>ⓞ</f>offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, <f>ⓟ</f>which can never take away sins.
Hebrews 10-12 But when Christ <f>[2]</f> had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he <f>ⓠ</f>sat down at the right hand of God,
Hebrews 10-13 waiting from that time <f>ⓡ</f>until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet.
Hebrews 10-14 For by a single offering <f>ⓢ</f>he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
Hebrews 10-15 <pb/>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
Hebrews 10-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> “This is the covenant that I will make with them </t><t>after those days, declares the Lord: </t><t>I will put my laws on their hearts, </t><t>and write them on their minds,” </t>
Hebrews 10-17 <pb/>then he adds, <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” </t>
Hebrews 10-18 <pb/>Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
Hebrews 10-19 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Therefore, brothers, <f>[3]</f> since we have confidence to enter <f>ⓦ</f>the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews 10-20 by <f>ⓧ</f>the new and living way that he opened for us through <f>ⓨ</f>the curtain, that is, through his flesh,
Hebrews 10-21 and since we have <f>ⓩ</f>a great priest over the house of God,
Hebrews 10-22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts <f>ⓐ</f>sprinkled clean <f>ⓑ</f>from an evil conscience and our bodies <f>ⓒ</f>washed with pure water.
Hebrews 10-23 <f>ⓓ</f> Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for <f>ⓔ</f>he who promised is faithful.
Hebrews 10-24 And <f>ⓕ</f>let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,
Hebrews 10-25 <f>ⓖ</f> not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and <f>ⓗ</f>all the more as you see <f>ⓘ</f>the Day drawing near.
Hebrews 10-26 <pb/>For <f>ⓙ</f>if we go on sinning deliberately <f>ⓚ</f>after receiving the knowledge of the truth, <f>ⓛ</f>there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
Hebrews 10-27 <f>ⓜ</f> but a fearful expectation of judgment, and <f>ⓝ</f>a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.
Hebrews 10-28 <f>ⓞ</f> Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy <f>ⓟ</f>on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews 10-29 How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one <f>ⓠ</f>who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned <f>ⓡ</f>the blood of the covenant <f>ⓢ</f>by which he was sanctified, and has <f>ⓣ</f>outraged the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews 10-30 For we know him who said, <f>ⓤ</f>“Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again, <f>ⓥ</f>“The Lord will judge his people.”
Hebrews 10-31 <f>ⓦ</f> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews 10-32 <pb/>But recall the former days when, after <f>ⓧ</f>you were enlightened, you endured <f>ⓨ</f>a hard struggle with sufferings,
Hebrews 10-33 sometimes being <f>ⓩ</f>publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
Hebrews 10-34 For <f>ⓐ</f>you had compassion on those in prison, and <f>ⓑ</f>you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had <f>ⓒ</f>a better possession and an abiding one.
Hebrews 10-35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has <f>ⓓ</f>a great reward.
Hebrews 10-36 For <f>ⓔ</f>you have need of endurance, so that <f>ⓕ</f>when you have done the will of God you may <f>ⓖ</f>receive what is promised.
Hebrews 10-37 For, <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f>“Yet a little while, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>the coming one will come and will not delay;</t>
Hebrews 10-38 <t><f>ⓙ</f> but my righteous one shall live by faith, </t><t>and if he shrinks back, </t><t>my soul has no pleasure in him.” </t>
Hebrews 10-39 <pb/>But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.
