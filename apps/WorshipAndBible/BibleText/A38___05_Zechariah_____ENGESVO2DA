Zechariah 5-1 <pb/>Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying <f>ⓐ</f>scroll!
Zechariah 5-2 And he said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying <f>ⓑ</f>scroll. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.” <f>[1]</f>
Zechariah 5-3 Then he said to me, “This is <f>ⓒ</f>the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land. For everyone who <f>ⓓ</f>steals shall be cleaned out according to what is on one side, and everyone who <f>ⓔ</f>swears falsely <f>[2]</f> shall be cleaned out according to what is on the other side.
Zechariah 5-4 I will send it out, declares the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of <f>ⓕ</f>him who swears falsely by my name. And <f>ⓖ</f>it shall remain in his house and <f>ⓗ</f>consume it, both timber and stones.”
Zechariah 5-5 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, <f>ⓙ</f>“Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out.”
Zechariah 5-6 And I said, “What is it?” He said, “This is <f>ⓚ</f>the basket <f>[3]</f> that is going out.” And he said, “This is their iniquity <f>[4]</f> in all the land.”
Zechariah 5-7 And behold, the leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting in the basket!
Zechariah 5-8 And he said, “This is Wickedness.” And he thrust her back into the basket, and thrust down <f>ⓛ</f>the leaden weight on its opening.
Zechariah 5-9 <pb/>Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, two women coming forward! <f>ⓜ</f>The wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and heaven.
Zechariah 5-10 Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”
Zechariah 5-11 He said to me, “To the <f>ⓝ</f>land of Shinar, to build a house for it. And when this is prepared, they will set the basket down there on its base.”
