1 Samuel 15-1 <pb/>And Samuel said to Saul, <f>ⓐ</f>“The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the LORD.
1 Samuel 15-2 Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘I have noted what Amalek did to Israel <f>ⓑ</f>in opposing them on the way when they came up out of Egypt.
1 Samuel 15-3 Now go and strike Amalek and <f>ⓒ</f>devote to destruction <f>[1]</f> all that they have. Do not spare them, <f>ⓓ</f>but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”
1 Samuel 15-4 <pb/>So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.
1 Samuel 15-5 And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.
1 Samuel 15-6 Then Saul said to <f>ⓔ</f>the Kenites, “Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. <f>ⓕ</f>For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
1 Samuel 15-7 <f>ⓖ</f> And Saul defeated the Amalekites from <f>ⓗ</f>Havilah as far as <f>ⓘ</f>Shur, which is east of Egypt.
1 Samuel 15-8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive <f>ⓙ</f>and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel 15-9 <f>ⓚ</f> But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves <f>[2]</f> and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.
1 Samuel 15-10 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to Samuel:
1 Samuel 15-11 <f>ⓛ</f> “I regret <f>[3]</f> that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and <f>ⓜ</f>has not performed my commandments.” And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the LORD all night.
1 Samuel 15-12 And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, “Saul came to <f>ⓝ</f>Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal.”
1 Samuel 15-13 And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, <f>ⓞ</f>“Blessed be you to the LORD. I have performed the commandment of the LORD.”
1 Samuel 15-14 And Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?”
1 Samuel 15-15 Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, <f>ⓟ</f>for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God, and the rest we have devoted to destruction.”
1 Samuel 15-16 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said to me this night.” And he said to him, “Speak.”
1 Samuel 15-17 <pb/>And Samuel said, <f>ⓠ</f>“Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.
1 Samuel 15-18 And the LORD sent you on a mission and said, ‘Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’
1 Samuel 15-19 Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? <f>ⓡ</f>Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?”
1 Samuel 15-20 And Saul said to Samuel, <f>ⓢ</f>“I have obeyed the voice of the LORD. I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me. I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have devoted the Amalekites to destruction.
1 Samuel 15-21 <f>ⓣ</f> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.”
1 Samuel 15-22 And Samuel said, <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, </t><t>as in obeying the voice of the LORD? </t><t>Behold, <f>ⓥ</f>to obey is better than sacrifice, </t><t>and to listen than the fat of rams.</t>
1 Samuel 15-23 <t>For rebellion is as the sin of divination, </t><t>and presumption is as iniquity and <f>ⓦ</f>idolatry. </t><t>Because <f>ⓧ</f>you have rejected the word of the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>he has also rejected you from being king.” </t>
1 Samuel 15-24 <pb/>Saul said to Samuel, <f>ⓩ</f>“I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
1 Samuel 15-25 Now therefore, please pardon my sin and <f>ⓐ</f>return with me that I may bow before the LORD.”
1 Samuel 15-26 And Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you. <f>ⓑ</f>For you have rejected the word of the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.”
1 Samuel 15-27 <f>ⓓ</f> As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore.
1 Samuel 15-28 And Samuel said to him, <f>ⓔ</f>“The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.
1 Samuel 15-29 And also the Glory of Israel <f>ⓕ</f>will not lie or have regret, for he is not a man, that he should have regret.”
1 Samuel 15-30 Then he said, “I have sinned; yet <f>ⓖ</f>honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>and return with me, that I may bow before the LORD your God.”
1 Samuel 15-31 So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed before the LORD.
1 Samuel 15-32 <pb/>Then Samuel said, “Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. <f>[4]</f> Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”
1 Samuel 15-33 And Samuel said, <f>ⓘ</f>“As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD <f>ⓙ</f>in Gilgal.
1 Samuel 15-34 <pb/>Then Samuel went <f>ⓚ</f>to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in <f>ⓛ</f>Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel 15-35 <f>ⓜ</f> And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, <f>ⓝ</f>but Samuel grieved over Saul. <f>ⓞ</f>And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.
