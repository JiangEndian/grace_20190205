Ezekiel 25-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 25-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>set your face toward <f>ⓒ</f>the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
Ezekiel 25-3 Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: <f>ⓓ</f>Thus says the Lord GOD, Because you said, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Aha!’ over my <f>ⓕ</f>sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile,
Ezekiel 25-4 therefore behold, I am handing you over to <f>ⓖ</f>the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
Ezekiel 25-5 I will make <f>ⓗ</f>Rabbah a <f>ⓘ</f>pasture for camels and Ammon <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓙ</f>a fold for flocks. <f>ⓚ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 25-6 For thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓛ</f>you have clapped your hands <f>ⓜ</f>and stamped your feet and <f>ⓝ</f>rejoiced with all the <f>ⓞ</f>malice within your soul against the land of Israel,
Ezekiel 25-7 therefore, behold, <f>ⓟ</f>I have stretched out my hand against you, and <f>ⓠ</f>will hand you over as plunder to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and will make you perish out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 25-8 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓡ</f>Moab and <f>ⓢ</f>Seir <f>[2]</f> said, ‘Behold, the <f>ⓣ</f>house of Judah is like all the other nations,’
Ezekiel 25-9 therefore <f>ⓤ</f>I will lay open the flank of Moab from the cities, from its cities on its frontier, the glory of the country, <f>ⓥ</f>Beth-jeshimoth, <f>ⓦ</f>Baal-meon, and <f>ⓧ</f>Kiriathaim.
Ezekiel 25-10 I will give it <f>ⓨ</f>along with the Ammonites <f>ⓩ</f>to the people of the East as a possession, <f>ⓐ</f>that the Ammonites may be remembered no more among the nations,
Ezekiel 25-11 <f>ⓑ</f> and I will execute judgments upon Moab. <f>ⓒ</f>Then they will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 25-12 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓓ</f>Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and has grievously offended <f>ⓔ</f>in taking vengeance on them,
Ezekiel 25-13 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, <f>ⓕ</f>I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it man and beast. And I will make it desolate; from <f>ⓖ</f>Teman even to <f>ⓗ</f>Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
Ezekiel 25-14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom <f>ⓘ</f>by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath, and <f>ⓙ</f>they shall know my vengeance, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 25-15 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓚ</f>the Philistines <f>ⓛ</f>acted revengefully and took vengeance <f>ⓜ</f>with malice of soul to destroy in never-ending enmity,
Ezekiel 25-16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, <f>ⓝ</f>Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off <f>ⓞ</f>the Cherethites and destroy the rest of the seacoast.
Ezekiel 25-17 I will execute great vengeance on them <f>ⓟ</f>with wrathful rebukes. <f>ⓠ</f>Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon them.”
