2 Corinthians 11-1 <pb/>I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me!
2 Corinthians 11-2 For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since <f>ⓐ</f>I betrothed you to one husband, <f>ⓑ</f>to present you <f>ⓒ</f>as a pure virgin to Christ.
2 Corinthians 11-3 But I am afraid that <f>ⓓ</f>as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts <f>ⓔ</f>will be led astray from a <f>ⓕ</f>sincere and <f>ⓖ</f>pure devotion to Christ.
2 Corinthians 11-4 For if someone comes and <f>ⓗ</f>proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept <f>ⓘ</f>a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough.
2 Corinthians 11-5 Indeed, I consider that <f>ⓙ</f>I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles.
2 Corinthians 11-6 <f>ⓚ</f> Even if I am unskilled in speaking, <f>ⓛ</f>I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way <f>ⓜ</f>we have made this plain to you in all things.
2 Corinthians 11-7 <pb/>Or <f>ⓝ</f>did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because <f>ⓞ</f>I preached God's gospel to you free of charge?
2 Corinthians 11-8 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.
2 Corinthians 11-9 And when I was with you and was <f>ⓟ</f>in need, <f>ⓠ</f>I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia <f>ⓡ</f>supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain <f>ⓢ</f>from burdening you in any way.
2 Corinthians 11-10 <f>ⓣ</f> As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine <f>ⓤ</f>will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.
2 Corinthians 11-11 And why? <f>ⓥ</f>Because I do not love you? <f>ⓦ</f>God knows I do!
2 Corinthians 11-12 <pb/>And what I am doing I will continue to do, <f>ⓧ</f>in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do.
2 Corinthians 11-13 For such men are <f>ⓨ</f>false apostles, <f>ⓩ</f>deceitful workmen, <f>ⓐ</f>disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
2 Corinthians 11-14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as <f>ⓑ</f>an angel of light.
2 Corinthians 11-15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as <f>ⓒ</f>servants of righteousness. <f>ⓓ</f>Their end will correspond to their deeds.
2 Corinthians 11-16 <pb/>I repeat, <f>ⓔ</f>let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.
2 Corinthians 11-17 What I am saying <f>ⓕ</f>with this boastful confidence, <f>ⓖ</f>I say not as the Lord would <f>[1]</f> but as a fool.
2 Corinthians 11-18 Since <f>ⓗ</f>many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.
2 Corinthians 11-19 For you gladly bear with fools, <f>ⓘ</f>being wise yourselves!
2 Corinthians 11-20 For you bear it if someone <f>ⓙ</f>makes slaves of you, or <f>ⓚ</f>devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or <f>ⓛ</f>strikes you in the face.
2 Corinthians 11-21 To my shame, I must say, <f>ⓜ</f>we were too weak for that! <pb/>But whatever anyone else dares to boast of — I am speaking as a fool — I also dare to boast of that.
2 Corinthians 11-22 Are they Hebrews? <f>ⓝ</f>So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I.
2 Corinthians 11-23 Are they <f>ⓞ</f>servants of Christ? <f>ⓟ</f>I am a better one — I am talking like a madman — with far greater labors, <f>ⓠ</f>far more imprisonments, <f>ⓡ</f>with countless beatings, and <f>ⓢ</f>often near death.
2 Corinthians 11-24 Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the <f>ⓣ</f>forty lashes less one.
2 Corinthians 11-25 Three times I was <f>ⓤ</f>beaten with rods. <f>ⓥ</f>Once I was stoned. Three times I <f>ⓦ</f>was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea;
2 Corinthians 11-26 on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, <f>ⓧ</f>danger from my own people, <f>ⓨ</f>danger from Gentiles, <f>ⓩ</f>danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers;
2 Corinthians 11-27 <f>ⓐ</f> in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, <f>ⓑ</f>in hunger and thirst, often without food, <f>[2]</f> in cold and exposure.
2 Corinthians 11-28 And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for <f>ⓒ</f>all the churches.
2 Corinthians 11-29 <f>ⓓ</f> Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?
2 Corinthians 11-30 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
2 Corinthians 11-31 <f>ⓕ</f> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, <f>ⓖ</f>he who is blessed forever, <f>ⓗ</f>knows that I am not lying.
2 Corinthians 11-32 At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas <f>ⓘ</f>was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me,
2 Corinthians 11-33 <f>ⓙ</f> but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.
