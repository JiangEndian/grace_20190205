1 Corinthians 8-1 <pb/>Now concerning <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>food offered to idols: we know that <f>ⓑ</f>“all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge” <f>ⓒ</f>puffs up, <f>ⓓ</f>but love builds up.
1 Corinthians 8-2 <f>ⓔ</f> If anyone imagines that he knows something, <f>ⓕ</f>he does not yet know as he ought to know.
1 Corinthians 8-3 But if anyone loves God, <f>ⓖ</f>he is known by God. <f>[2]</f>
1 Corinthians 8-4 <pb/>Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that <f>ⓗ</f>“an idol has no real existence,” and that <f>ⓘ</f>“there is no God but one.”
1 Corinthians 8-5 For although there may be <f>ⓙ</f>so-called gods in heaven or on earth — as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords” —
1 Corinthians 8-6 yet <f>ⓚ</f>for us there is one God, the Father, <f>ⓛ</f>from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and <f>ⓜ</f>one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and <f>ⓝ</f>through whom we exist.
1 Corinthians 8-7 <pb/>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, <f>ⓞ</f>through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and <f>ⓟ</f>their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
1 Corinthians 8-8 <f>ⓠ</f> Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
1 Corinthians 8-9 But take care <f>ⓡ</f>that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block <f>ⓢ</f>to the weak.
1 Corinthians 8-10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating <f>[3]</f> in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, <f>[4]</f> if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?
1 Corinthians 8-11 And so by your knowledge this weak person is <f>ⓣ</f>destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.
1 Corinthians 8-12 Thus, sinning against your brothers <f>[5]</f> and <f>ⓤ</f>wounding their conscience when it is weak, <f>ⓥ</f>you sin against Christ.
1 Corinthians 8-13 Therefore, <f>ⓦ</f>if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
