Romans 14-4 <f>ⓓ</f> Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master <f>[1]</f> that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
Romans 14-5 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. <f>ⓕ</f>Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.
Romans 14-6 The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since <f>ⓖ</f>he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.

Romans 14-9 For to this end Christ <f>ⓙ</f>died and lived again, that he might be Lord both <f>ⓚ</f>of the dead and of the living.
Romans 14-10 <pb/>Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For <f>ⓛ</f>we will all stand before <f>ⓜ</f>the judgment seat of God;
Romans 14-11 for it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, </t><t>and every tongue shall confess <f>[2]</f> to God.” </t>

Romans 14-15 For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, <f>ⓣ</f>you are no longer walking in love. <f>ⓤ</f>By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.
Romans 14-16 <f>ⓥ</f> So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil.
Romans 14-17 <f>ⓦ</f> For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but <f>ⓧ</f>of righteousness and <f>ⓨ</f>peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

Romans 14-21 <f>ⓕ</f> It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble. <f>[3]</f>
Romans 14-22 The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. <f>ⓖ</f>Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves.
Romans 14-23 But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin. <f>[4]</f>
