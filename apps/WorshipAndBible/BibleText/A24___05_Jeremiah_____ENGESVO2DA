Jeremiah 5-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, </t><t>look and take note! </t><t>Search her squares to see </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>if you can find a man, </t><t>one who does justice </t><t>and seeks truth, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>that I may pardon her.</t>
Jeremiah 5-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Though they say, “As the LORD lives,” </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>yet they swear falsely.</t>
Jeremiah 5-3 <t>O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>You have struck them down, </t><t>but they felt no anguish; </t><t>you have consumed them, </t><t>but they refused to take correction. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>They have made their faces harder than rock; </t><t>they have refused to repent. </t>
Jeremiah 5-4 <pb/><t>Then I said, “These are only the poor; </t><t>they have no sense; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>for they do not know the way of the LORD, </t><t>the justice of their God.</t>
Jeremiah 5-5 <t>I will go to the great </t><t>and will speak to them, </t><t>for they know the way of the LORD, </t><t>the justice of their God.” </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>But they all alike had broken the yoke; </t><t>they had burst the bonds. </t>
Jeremiah 5-6 <pb/><t>Therefore <f>ⓙ</f>a lion from the forest shall strike them down; </t><t>a <f>ⓚ</f>wolf from the desert shall devastate them. </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>A leopard is watching their cities; </t><t>everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, </t><t>because their transgressions are many, </t><t>their <f>ⓜ</f>apostasies are great. </t>
Jeremiah 5-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> “How can I pardon you? </t><t>Your children have forsaken me </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and have sworn by those who are no gods. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>When I fed them to the full, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>they committed adultery </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>and trooped to the houses of whores.</t>
Jeremiah 5-8 <t>They were well-fed, lusty stallions, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>each neighing <f>ⓣ</f>for his neighbor's wife.</t>

Jeremiah 5-13 <t>The prophets will become wind; </t><t>the word is not in them. </t><t>Thus shall it be done to them!’” </t>

Jeremiah 5-15 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Behold, I am bringing against you </t><t>a nation from afar, O house of Israel, <pb/>declares the LORD. </t><t>It is an enduring nation; </t><t>it is an ancient nation, </t><t>a nation whose language you do not know, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>nor can you understand what they say.</t>
Jeremiah 5-16 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Their quiver is like <f>ⓕ</f>an open tomb; </t><t>they are all mighty warriors.</t>
Jeremiah 5-17 <t><f>ⓖ</f> They shall eat up your harvest and your food; </t><t>they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; </t><t>they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; </t><t>they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; </t><t>your <f>ⓗ</f>fortified cities in which you trust </t><t>they shall beat down with the sword.” </t>

Jeremiah 5-22 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Do you not fear me? declares the LORD. </t><t>Do you not tremble before me? </t><t>I placed the sand <f>ⓞ</f>as the boundary for the sea, </t><t>a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; </t><t>though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; </t><t>though <f>ⓟ</f>they roar, they cannot pass over it.</t>
Jeremiah 5-23 <t><f>ⓠ</f> But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; </t><t>they have turned aside and gone away.</t>

Jeremiah 5-31 <t><f>ⓐ</f> the prophets prophesy falsely, </t><t>and the priests rule at their direction; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>my people love to have it so, </t><t>but what will you do when the end comes? </t>
