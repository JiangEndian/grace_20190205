Mark 12-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And he began to speak to them in parables. <J>“A man planted <f>ⓑ</f>a vineyard <f>ⓒ</f>and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and <f>ⓓ</f>leased it to tenants and <f>ⓔ</f>went into another country.</J>
Mark 12-2 <J>When the season came, he sent a servant <f>[1]</f> to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</J>
Mark 12-3 <J><f>ⓕ</f> And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</J>
Mark 12-4 <J><f>ⓖ</f> Again <f>ⓗ</f>he sent to them another servant, and <f>ⓘ</f>they struck him on the head and <f>ⓙ</f>treated him shamefully.</J>
Mark 12-5 <J><f>ⓚ</f> And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed.</J>
Mark 12-6 <J>He had still one other, <f>ⓛ</f>a beloved son. <f>ⓜ</f>Finally he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</J>
Mark 12-7 <J>But those tenants said to one another, <f>ⓝ</f>‘This is the heir. Come, <f>ⓞ</f>let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’</J>
Mark 12-8 <J>And they took him and killed him and <f>ⓟ</f>threw him out of the vineyard.</J>
Mark 12-9 <J>What will the owner of the vineyard do? <f>ⓠ</f>He will <f>ⓡ</f>come and destroy the tenants and <f>ⓢ</f>give the vineyard to others.</J>
Mark 12-10 <J><f>ⓣ</f> Have you not read <f>ⓤ</f>this Scripture:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓥ</f>“‘The stone that the builders rejected</J> </t><t><J>has become the cornerstone; <f>[2]</f></J></t>
Mark 12-11 <t><J>this was the Lord's doing,</J> </t><t><J>and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”</J> </t>
Mark 12-12 <pb/>And <f>ⓦ</f>they were seeking to arrest him <f>ⓧ</f>but feared the people, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them. So they <f>ⓨ</f>left him and went away.
Mark 12-13 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> And they sent to him some of <f>ⓐ</f>the Pharisees and some of <f>ⓑ</f>the Herodians, to <f>ⓒ</f>trap him in his talk.
Mark 12-14 And they came and said to him, “Teacher, <f>ⓓ</f>we know that you are true and do not care about anyone's opinion. For <f>ⓔ</f>you are not swayed by appearances, <f>[3]</f> but truly teach <f>ⓕ</f>the way of God. Is it lawful to pay <f>ⓖ</f>taxes to <f>ⓗ</f>Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?”
Mark 12-15 But, knowing <f>ⓘ</f>their hypocrisy, he said to them, <J>“Why <f>ⓙ</f>put me to the test? Bring me <f>ⓚ</f>a denarius <f>[4]</f> and let me look at it.”</J>
Mark 12-16 And they brought one. And he said to them, <J>“Whose likeness and inscription is this?”</J> They said to him, “Caesar's.”
Mark 12-17 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</J> And they marveled at him.
Mark 12-18 <pb/>And <f>ⓜ</f>Sadducees came to him, <f>ⓝ</f>who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked him a question, saying,
Mark 12-19 “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that <f>ⓞ</f>if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man <f>[5]</f> must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
Mark 12-20 There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring.
Mark 12-21 And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise.
Mark 12-22 And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died.
Mark 12-23 In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.”
Mark 12-24 <pb/>Jesus said to them, <J>“Is this not the reason you are wrong, because <f>ⓟ</f>you know neither the Scriptures nor <f>ⓠ</f>the power of God?</J>
Mark 12-25 <J>For when they rise from the dead, they neither <f>ⓡ</f>marry nor <f>ⓢ</f>are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</J>
Mark 12-26 <J>And as for the dead being raised, <f>ⓣ</f>have you not read in <f>ⓤ</f>the book of Moses, in <f>ⓥ</f>the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, <f>ⓦ</f>‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</J>
Mark 12-27 <J>He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite wrong.”</J>
Mark 12-28 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”
Mark 12-29 Jesus answered, <J>“The most important is, <f>ⓨ</f>‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, <f>ⓩ</f>the Lord is one.</J>
Mark 12-30 <J>And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’</J>
Mark 12-31 <J><f>ⓐ</f> The second is this: <f>ⓑ</f>‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment <f>ⓒ</f>greater than these.”</J>
Mark 12-32 And the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that <f>ⓓ</f>he is one, and <f>ⓔ</f>there is no other besides him.
Mark 12-33 And to love him with all the heart and with all <f>ⓕ</f>the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, <f>ⓖ</f>is much more than all <f>ⓗ</f>whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
Mark 12-34 And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, <J>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</J> <f>ⓘ</f>And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Mark 12-35 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> And as <f>ⓚ</f>Jesus taught in the temple, he said, <J>“How can the scribes say that <f>ⓛ</f>the Christ is the son of David?</J>
Mark 12-36 <J>David himself, <f>ⓜ</f>in the Holy Spirit, declared,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓝ</f>“‘The Lord said to my Lord,</J> </t><t><J>“Sit at my right hand,</J> </t><t><J>until I put your enemies <f>ⓞ</f>under your feet.”’</J> </t>
Mark 12-37 <pb/><J>David himself calls him Lord. So <f>ⓟ</f>how is he his son?”</J> And the great throng <f>ⓠ</f>heard him gladly.
Mark 12-38 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And in his teaching he said, <J>“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces</J>
Mark 12-39 <J>and have the best seats in the synagogues and <f>ⓢ</f>the places of honor at feasts,</J>
Mark 12-40 <J><f>ⓣ</f> who devour widows' houses and <f>ⓤ</f>for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”</J>
Mark 12-41 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> And he sat down opposite <f>ⓦ</f>the treasury and watched the people <f>ⓧ</f>putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums.
Mark 12-42 And a poor widow came and put in two <f>ⓨ</f>small copper coins, which make a penny. <f>[6]</f>
Mark 12-43 And he called his disciples to him and said to them, <J>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓩ</f>this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box.</J>
Mark 12-44 <J>For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her <f>ⓐ</f>poverty has put in everything she had, all <f>ⓑ</f>she had to live on.”</J>
