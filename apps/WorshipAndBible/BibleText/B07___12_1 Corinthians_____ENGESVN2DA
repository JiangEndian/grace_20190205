1 Corinthians 12-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>concerning <f>[1]</f> spiritual gifts, <f>[2]</f> brothers, <f>[3]</f> I do not want you to be uninformed.
1 Corinthians 12-2 You know that <f>ⓑ</f>when you were pagans <f>ⓒ</f>you were led astray to <f>ⓓ</f>mute idols, however you were led.
1 Corinthians 12-3 Therefore I want you to understand that <f>ⓔ</f>no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is <f>ⓕ</f>accursed!” and <f>ⓖ</f>no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.
1 Corinthians 12-4 <pb/>Now <f>ⓗ</f>there are varieties of gifts, but <f>ⓘ</f>the same Spirit;
1 Corinthians 12-5 and <f>ⓙ</f>there are varieties of service, but <f>ⓚ</f>the same Lord;
1 Corinthians 12-6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is <f>ⓛ</f>the same God who empowers them all in everyone.
1 Corinthians 12-7 <f>ⓜ</f> To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
1 Corinthians 12-8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of <f>ⓝ</f>wisdom, and to another the utterance of <f>ⓞ</f>knowledge according to the same Spirit,
1 Corinthians 12-9 to another <f>ⓟ</f>faith by the same Spirit, to another <f>ⓠ</f>gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
1 Corinthians 12-10 to another <f>ⓡ</f>the working of miracles, to another <f>ⓢ</f>prophecy, to another <f>ⓣ</f>the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another <f>ⓤ</f>various kinds of tongues, to another <f>ⓥ</f>the interpretation of tongues.
1 Corinthians 12-11 All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, <f>ⓦ</f>who apportions to each one individually <f>ⓧ</f>as he wills.
1 Corinthians 12-12 <pb/>For just as <f>ⓨ</f>the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, <f>ⓩ</f>so it is with Christ.
1 Corinthians 12-13 For <f>ⓐ</f>in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body — <f>ⓑ</f>Jews or Greeks, slaves <f>[4]</f> or free — and <f>ⓒ</f>all were made to drink of one Spirit.
1 Corinthians 12-14 <pb/>For the body does not consist of one member but of many.
1 Corinthians 12-15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
1 Corinthians 12-16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
1 Corinthians 12-17 If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?
1 Corinthians 12-18 But as it is, <f>ⓓ</f>God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, <f>ⓔ</f>as he chose.
1 Corinthians 12-19 If all were a single member, where would the body be?
1 Corinthians 12-20 As it is, there are many parts, <f>[5]</f> yet one body.
1 Corinthians 12-21 <pb/>The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”
1 Corinthians 12-22 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
1 Corinthians 12-23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
1 Corinthians 12-24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,
1 Corinthians 12-25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
1 Corinthians 12-26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, <f>ⓕ</f>all rejoice together.
1 Corinthians 12-27 <pb/>Now <f>ⓖ</f>you are the body of Christ and individually <f>ⓗ</f>members of it.
1 Corinthians 12-28 And <f>ⓘ</f>God has appointed in the church first <f>ⓙ</f>apostles, second <f>ⓚ</f>prophets, third teachers, then <f>ⓛ</f>miracles, then <f>ⓜ</f>gifts of healing, <f>ⓝ</f>helping, <f>ⓞ</f>administrating, and <f>ⓟ</f>various kinds of tongues.
1 Corinthians 12-29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
1 Corinthians 12-30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
1 Corinthians 12-31 But <f>ⓠ</f>earnestly desire the higher gifts. <pb/>And I will show you a still more excellent way.
