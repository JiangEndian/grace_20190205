Deuteronomy 8-1 <pb/>“The whole commandment that I command you today <f>ⓐ</f>you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers.
Deuteronomy 8-2 And you shall remember the whole way that the LORD your God has led you <f>ⓑ</f>these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, <f>ⓒ</f>testing you <f>ⓓ</f>to know what was in your heart, <f>ⓔ</f>whether you would keep his commandments or not.
Deuteronomy 8-3 And he humbled you and <f>ⓕ</f>let you hunger and <f>ⓖ</f>fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that <f>ⓗ</f>man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word <f>[1]</f> that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
Deuteronomy 8-4 <f>ⓘ</f> Your clothing did not wear out on you and your foot did not swell these forty years.
Deuteronomy 8-5 Know then in your heart that, <f>ⓙ</f>as a man disciplines his son, the LORD your God disciplines you.
Deuteronomy 8-6 So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him.
Deuteronomy 8-7 For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, <f>ⓚ</f>a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing out in the valleys and hills,
Deuteronomy 8-8 a land of wheat and barley, <f>ⓛ</f>of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey,
Deuteronomy 8-9 a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
Deuteronomy 8-10 And you shall eat and be full, and you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land he has given you.
Deuteronomy 8-11 <pb/>“Take care lest you forget the LORD your God by not keeping his commandments and his rules and his statutes, which I command you today,
Deuteronomy 8-12 <f>ⓜ</f> lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and live in them,
Deuteronomy 8-13 and when your herds and flocks multiply and your silver and gold is multiplied and all that you have is multiplied,
Deuteronomy 8-14 <f>ⓝ</f> then your heart be lifted up, and you <f>ⓞ</f>forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery,
Deuteronomy 8-15 who <f>ⓟ</f>led you through the great and terrifying wilderness, <f>ⓠ</f>with its fiery serpents and scorpions <f>ⓡ</f>and thirsty ground where there was no water, <f>ⓢ</f>who brought you water out of the flinty rock,
Deuteronomy 8-16 who fed you in the wilderness with <f>ⓣ</f>manna that your fathers did not know, that he might humble you and test you, <f>ⓤ</f>to do you good in the end.
Deuteronomy 8-17 Beware <f>ⓥ</f>lest you say in your heart, ‘My power and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth.’
Deuteronomy 8-18 You shall remember the LORD your God, for <f>ⓦ</f>it is he who gives you power to get wealth, <f>ⓧ</f>that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.
Deuteronomy 8-19 And if you forget the LORD your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, <f>ⓨ</f>I solemnly warn you today that you shall surely perish.
Deuteronomy 8-20 Like the nations that the LORD makes to perish before you, <f>ⓩ</f>so shall you perish, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
