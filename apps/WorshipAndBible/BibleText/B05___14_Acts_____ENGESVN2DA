Acts 14-1 <pb/>Now at Iconium <f>ⓐ</f>they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
Acts 14-2 <f>ⓑ</f> But the <f>ⓒ</f>unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against <f>ⓓ</f>the brothers. <f>[1]</f>
Acts 14-3 So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for <f>ⓔ</f>the Lord, who bore witness to <f>ⓕ</f>the word of his grace, <f>ⓖ</f>granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
Acts 14-4 But the people of the city <f>ⓗ</f>were divided; <f>ⓘ</f>some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles.
Acts 14-5 When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, <f>ⓙ</f>to mistreat them and <f>ⓚ</f>to stone them,
Acts 14-6 they learned of it and <f>ⓛ</f>fled to <f>ⓜ</f>Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country,
Acts 14-7 and there they continued to preach the gospel.
Acts 14-8 <pb/>Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was <f>ⓝ</f>crippled from birth and had never walked.
Acts 14-9 He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and <f>ⓞ</f>seeing that he had faith to be made well, <f>[2]</f>
Acts 14-10 said in a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And he <f>ⓟ</f>sprang up and began walking.
Acts 14-11 And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, <f>ⓠ</f>“The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!”
Acts 14-12 Barnabas they called <f>ⓡ</f>Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
Acts 14-13 And the priest of <f>ⓢ</f>Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and <f>ⓣ</f>wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.
Acts 14-14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they <f>ⓤ</f>tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out,
Acts 14-15 “Men, <f>ⓥ</f>why are you doing these things? We also are men, <f>ⓦ</f>of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that <f>ⓧ</f>you should turn from these <f>ⓨ</f>vain things to <f>ⓩ</f>a living God, <f>ⓐ</f>who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.
Acts 14-16 In past generations he <f>ⓑ</f>allowed all the nations <f>ⓒ</f>to walk in their own ways.
Acts 14-17 Yet <f>ⓓ</f>he did not leave himself without witness, for he <f>ⓔ</f>did good by <f>ⓕ</f>giving you rains from heaven and <f>ⓖ</f>fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with <f>ⓗ</f>food and <f>ⓘ</f>gladness.”
Acts 14-18 Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.
Acts 14-19 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, <f>ⓚ</f>they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
Acts 14-20 But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
Acts 14-21 When they had preached the gospel to that city and had <f>ⓛ</f>made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
Acts 14-22 <f>ⓜ</f> strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them <f>ⓝ</f>to continue in <f>ⓞ</f>the faith, and saying that <f>ⓟ</f>through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.
Acts 14-23 And when they had <f>ⓠ</f>appointed <f>ⓡ</f>elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting <f>ⓢ</f>they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
Acts 14-24 <pb/>Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
Acts 14-25 And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,
Acts 14-26 and from there they sailed to Antioch, <f>ⓣ</f>where they had been <f>ⓤ</f>commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled.
Acts 14-27 And when they arrived and gathered the church together, <f>ⓥ</f>they declared all that God had done with them, and <f>ⓦ</f>how he had <f>ⓧ</f>opened <f>ⓨ</f>a door of faith to the Gentiles.
Acts 14-28 And they remained no little time with the disciples.
