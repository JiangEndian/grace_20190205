Ezra 8-1 <pb/>These are the heads of their fathers' houses, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylonia, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:
Ezra 8-2 Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of <f>ⓐ</f>Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, <f>ⓑ</f>Hattush.
Ezra 8-3 Of the sons of Shecaniah, who was of the sons of <f>ⓒ</f>Parosh, Zechariah, with whom were registered 150 men.
Ezra 8-4 <f>ⓓ</f> Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men.
Ezra 8-5 Of the sons of Zattu, <f>[1]</f> Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men.
Ezra 8-6 Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men.
Ezra 8-7 Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men.
Ezra 8-8 Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him 80 men.
Ezra 8-9 Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men.
Ezra 8-10 Of the sons of Bani, <f>[2]</f> Shelomith the son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men.
Ezra 8-11 <f>ⓔ</f> Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah, the son of Bebai, and with him 28 men.
Ezra 8-12 Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men.
Ezra 8-13 Of the sons of Adonikam, those who came later, their names being Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men.
Ezra 8-14 Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them 70 men.
Ezra 8-15 <pb/>I gathered them to the river that runs to <f>ⓕ</f>Ahava, and there we camped three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there <f>ⓖ</f>none of the sons of Levi.
Ezra 8-16 Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and <f>ⓗ</f>Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of insight,
Ezra 8-17 and sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brothers and <f>[3]</f> the temple servants at the place Casiphia, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God.
Ezra 8-18 And <f>ⓘ</f>by the good hand of our God on us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of <f>ⓙ</f>Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen, 18;
Ezra 8-19 also <f>ⓚ</f>Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of <f>ⓛ</f>the sons of Merari, with his kinsmen and their sons, 20;
Ezra 8-20 <f>ⓜ</f> besides 220 of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all <f>ⓝ</f>mentioned by name.
Ezra 8-21 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river <f>ⓟ</f>Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, <f>ⓠ</f>to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our goods.
Ezra 8-22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king, <f>ⓡ</f>“The hand of our God is for good on <f>ⓢ</f>all who seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all who forsake him.”
Ezra 8-23 So we fasted and implored our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.
Ezra 8-24 <pb/>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: <f>ⓣ</f>Sherebiah, <f>ⓤ</f>Hashabiah, and ten of their kinsmen with them.
Ezra 8-25 And I weighed out to them the <f>ⓥ</f>silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God that the king and his <f>ⓦ</f>counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered.
Ezra 8-26 <f>ⓧ</f> I weighed out into their hand 650 talents <f>[4]</f> of silver, and silver vessels worth 200 talents, <f>[5]</f> and 100 talents of gold,
Ezra 8-27 20 bowls of gold worth 1,000 darics, <f>[6]</f> and two vessels of fine bright bronze as precious as gold.
Ezra 8-28 And I said to them, <f>ⓨ</f>“You are holy to the LORD, and <f>ⓩ</f>the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.
Ezra 8-29 Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at Jerusalem, <f>ⓐ</f>within the chambers of the house of the LORD.”
Ezra 8-30 So the priests and the Levites <f>ⓑ</f>took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.
Ezra 8-31 <pb/>Then we departed from the river Ahava <f>ⓒ</f>on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. <f>ⓓ</f>The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the way.
Ezra 8-32 <f>ⓔ</f> We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days.
Ezra 8-33 On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver and the gold and the vessels were <f>ⓕ</f>weighed into the hands of <f>ⓖ</f>Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, <f>ⓗ</f>Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of <f>ⓘ</f>Binnui.
Ezra 8-34 The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.
Ezra 8-35 <pb/>At that time <f>ⓙ</f>those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, <f>ⓚ</f>twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
Ezra 8-36 <f>ⓛ</f> They also delivered the king's commissions to the king's <f>ⓜ</f>satraps <f>[7]</f> and to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and they aided the people and the house of God.
