Deuteronomy 5-15 <f>ⓙ</f> You shall remember that you were a slave <f>[3]</f> in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out from there <f>ⓚ</f>with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.

Deuteronomy 5-33 <f>ⓒ</f> You shall walk in all the way that the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and <f>ⓓ</f>that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land that you shall possess.
