Isaiah 6-1 <pb/>In the year that <f>ⓐ</f>King Uzziah died I <f>ⓑ</f>saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train <f>[1]</f> of his robe filled the temple.
Isaiah 6-2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had <f>ⓒ</f>six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
Isaiah 6-3 And one called to another and said: <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>the whole earth is full of his glory!” <f>[2]</f> </t>
Isaiah 6-4 <pb/>And <f>ⓕ</f>the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and <f>ⓖ</f>the house was filled with smoke.
Isaiah 6-5 And I said: “Woe is me! <f>ⓗ</f>For I am lost; <f>ⓘ</f>for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the <f>ⓙ</f>King, the LORD of hosts!”
Isaiah 6-6 <pb/>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
Isaiah 6-7 And he <f>ⓚ</f>touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”
Isaiah 6-8 <pb/>And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for <f>ⓛ</f>us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.”
Isaiah 6-9 And he said, “Go, and say to this people: <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“‘Keep on hearing, <f>[3]</f> but do not understand; </t><t>keep on seeing, <f>[4]</f> but do not perceive.’</t>
Isaiah 6-10 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Make the heart of this people <f>ⓞ</f>dull, <f>[5]</f> </t><t>and their ears heavy, </t><t>and blind their eyes; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>lest they see with their eyes, </t><t>and hear with their ears, </t><t>and understand with their hearts, </t><t>and turn and be healed.”</t>
Isaiah 6-11 <t>Then I said, <f>ⓠ</f>“How long, O Lord?” </t><t>And he said: </t><t>“Until <f>ⓡ</f>cities lie waste </t><t>without inhabitant, </t><t>and houses without people, </t><t>and the land is a desolate waste,</t>
Isaiah 6-12 <t>and the LORD removes people far away, </t><t>and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</t>
Isaiah 6-13 <t><f>ⓢ</f> And though a tenth remain in it, </t><t>it will be burned <f>[6]</f> again, </t><t>like a terebinth or an oak, </t><t>whose stump <f>ⓣ</f>remains </t><t>when it is felled.” </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>The holy seed <f>[7]</f> is its stump. </t>
