Jeremiah 13-1 <pb/>Thus says the LORD to me, “Go and buy a linen loincloth and <f>ⓐ</f>put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water.”
Jeremiah 13-2 So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD, and put it around my waist.
Jeremiah 13-3 And the word of the LORD came to me a second time,
Jeremiah 13-4 “Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, <f>ⓑ</f>go to the Euphrates and hide it there in <f>ⓒ</f>a cleft of the rock.”
Jeremiah 13-5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
Jeremiah 13-6 And after many days the LORD said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there <f>ⓓ</f>the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”
Jeremiah 13-7 Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took <f>ⓔ</f>the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was <f>ⓕ</f>spoiled; it was <f>ⓖ</f>good for nothing.
Jeremiah 13-8 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah 13-9 “Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓗ</f>Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great <f>ⓘ</f>pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 13-10 This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, <f>ⓙ</f>who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is <f>ⓚ</f>good for nothing.
Jeremiah 13-11 For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, <f>ⓛ</f>that they might be for me a people, <f>ⓜ</f>a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.
Jeremiah 13-12 <pb/>“You shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, “Every jar shall be filled with wine.”’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that <f>ⓝ</f>every jar will be filled with wine?’
Jeremiah 13-13 Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓞ</f>Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: <f>ⓟ</f>the kings who sit on David's throne, <f>ⓠ</f>the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 13-14 And I will <f>ⓡ</f>dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.’”
Jeremiah 13-15 <pb/><t>Hear and give ear; be not proud, </t><t>for the LORD has spoken.</t>
Jeremiah 13-16 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Give glory to the LORD your God </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>before he brings darkness, </t><t>before your feet stumble </t><t>on the twilight mountains, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>while you look for light </t><t>he turns it into gloom </t><t>and makes it <f>ⓥ</f>deep darkness.</t>
Jeremiah 13-17 <t>But if you will not listen, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>my soul will weep in secret for your pride; </t><t>my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, </t><t>because the LORD's flock has been taken captive. </t>
Jeremiah 13-18 <pb/><t>Say to <f>ⓧ</f>the king and <f>ⓨ</f>the queen mother: </t><t>“Take a lowly seat, </t><t>for <f>ⓩ</f>your beautiful crown </t><t>has come down from your head.”</t>
Jeremiah 13-19 <t><f>ⓐ</f> The cities of the Negeb are shut up, </t><t>with none to open them; </t><t>all Judah is taken into exile, </t><t>wholly taken into exile. </t>
Jeremiah 13-20 <pb/><t>“Lift up your eyes <f>ⓑ</f>and see </t><t>those who come from the north. </t><t>Where is the flock that was given you, </t><t>your beautiful flock?</t>
Jeremiah 13-21 <t>What will you say when they set as head over you </t><t>those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you? </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>Will not pangs take hold of you </t><t>like those of a woman in labor?</t>
Jeremiah 13-22 <t>And if you say in your heart, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>‘Why have these things come upon me?’ </t><t>it is for the greatness of your iniquity </t><t>that <f>ⓔ</f>your skirts are lifted up </t><t>and you suffer violence.</t>
Jeremiah 13-23 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Can the Ethiopian change his skin </t><t>or <f>ⓖ</f>the leopard his spots? </t><t>Then also you can do good </t><t>who are accustomed to do evil.</t>
Jeremiah 13-24 <t>I will scatter you <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓗ</f>like chaff </t><t>driven by the wind from the desert.</t>
Jeremiah 13-25 <t><f>ⓘ</f> This is your lot, </t><t>the portion I have measured out to you, declares the LORD, </t><t>because <f>ⓙ</f>you have forgotten me </t><t>and trusted in lies.</t>
Jeremiah 13-26 <t><f>ⓚ</f> I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, </t><t>and your shame will be seen.</t>
Jeremiah 13-27 <t>I have seen <f>ⓛ</f>your abominations, </t><t>your adulteries and <f>ⓜ</f>neighings, your lewd whorings, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>on the hills in the field. </t><t>Woe to you, O Jerusalem! </t><t>How long will it be <f>ⓞ</f>before you are made clean?” </t>
