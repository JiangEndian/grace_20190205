Isaiah 31-1 <pb/><t>Woe <f>[1]</f> to <f>ⓐ</f>those who go down to Egypt for help </t><t>and rely on horses, </t><t>who <f>ⓑ</f>trust in chariots because they are many </t><t>and in horsemen because they are very strong, </t><t>but <f>ⓒ</f>do not look to the Holy One of Israel </t><t>or consult the LORD!</t>
Isaiah 31-2 <t>And <f>ⓓ</f>yet he is wise and brings disaster; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>he does not call back his words, </t><t>but <f>ⓕ</f>will arise against the house of the evildoers </t><t>and against the helpers of <f>ⓖ</f>those who work iniquity.</t>
Isaiah 31-3 <t>The Egyptians are man, and not God, </t><t>and their horses <f>ⓗ</f>are flesh, and not spirit. </t><t>When the LORD stretches out his hand, </t><t>the helper will stumble, and he who is helped will fall, </t><t>and they will all perish together. </t>
Isaiah 31-4 <pb/><t>For thus the LORD said to me, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>“As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey, </t><t>and when a band of shepherds is called out against him </t><t>he is not terrified by their shouting </t><t>or daunted at their noise, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>so the LORD of hosts will come down </t><t>to fight <f>[2]</f> on Mount Zion and on its hill.</t>
Isaiah 31-5 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Like birds hovering, so the LORD of hosts </t><t>will protect Jerusalem; </t><t>he will protect and deliver it; </t><t>he will spare and rescue it.” </t>
Isaiah 31-6 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Turn to him from whom people <f>[3]</f> have <f>ⓜ</f>deeply revolted, O children of Israel.
Isaiah 31-7 For in that day <f>ⓝ</f>everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have sinfully made for you.
Isaiah 31-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> “And the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man; </t><t>and a sword, not of man, shall devour him; </t><t>and he shall flee from the sword, </t><t>and his young men shall be <f>ⓟ</f>put to forced labor.</t>
Isaiah 31-9 <t><f>ⓠ</f> His rock shall pass away in terror, </t><t>and his officers desert the standard in panic,” </t><t>declares the LORD, whose <f>ⓡ</f>fire is in Zion, </t><t>and whose <f>ⓢ</f>furnace is in Jerusalem. </t>
