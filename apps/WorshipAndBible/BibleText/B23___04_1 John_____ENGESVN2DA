1 John 4-1 <pb/>Beloved, <f>ⓐ</f>do not believe every spirit, but <f>ⓑ</f>test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for <f>ⓒ</f>many <f>ⓓ</f>false prophets <f>ⓔ</f>have gone out into the world.
1 John 4-2 By this you know the Spirit of God: <f>ⓕ</f>every spirit that confesses that <f>ⓖ</f>Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
1 John 4-3 and every spirit <f>ⓗ</f>that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and <f>ⓘ</f>now is in the world already.
1 John 4-4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for <f>ⓙ</f>he who is in you is greater than <f>ⓚ</f>he who is in the world.
1 John 4-5 <f>ⓛ</f> They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and <f>ⓜ</f>the world listens to them.
1 John 4-6 We are from God. <f>ⓝ</f>Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know <f>ⓞ</f>the Spirit of truth and <f>ⓟ</f>the spirit of error.
1 John 4-7 <pb/>Beloved, <f>ⓠ</f>let us love one another, for love is from God, and <f>ⓡ</f>whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
1 John 4-8 <f>ⓢ</f> Anyone who does not love does not know God, because <f>ⓣ</f>God is love.
1 John 4-9 In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that <f>ⓤ</f>God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.
1 John 4-10 In this is love, <f>ⓥ</f>not that we have loved God <f>ⓦ</f>but that he loved us and sent his Son to be <f>ⓧ</f>the propitiation for our sins.
1 John 4-11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
1 John 4-12 <f>ⓨ</f> No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and <f>ⓩ</f>his love is perfected in us.
1 John 4-13 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
1 John 4-14 And <f>ⓑ</f>we have seen and testify that <f>ⓒ</f>the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of <f>ⓓ</f>the world.
1 John 4-15 <f>ⓔ</f> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
1 John 4-16 So <f>ⓕ</f>we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. <f>ⓖ</f>God is love, and <f>ⓗ</f>whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
1 John 4-17 By this <f>ⓘ</f>is love perfected with us, so that <f>ⓙ</f>we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because <f>ⓚ</f>as he is so also are we in this world.
1 John 4-18 There is no fear in love, but <f>ⓛ</f>perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not <f>ⓜ</f>been perfected in love.
1 John 4-19 <f>ⓝ</f> We love because he first loved us.
1 John 4-20 <f>ⓞ</f> If anyone says, “I love God,” and <f>ⓟ</f>hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot <f>[1]</f> love God <f>ⓠ</f>whom he has not seen.
1 John 4-21 And <f>ⓡ</f>this commandment we have from him: <f>ⓢ</f>whoever loves God must also love his brother.
