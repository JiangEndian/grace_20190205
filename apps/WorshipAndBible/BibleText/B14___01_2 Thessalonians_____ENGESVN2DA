2 Thessalonians 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, <pb/>To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Thessalonians 1-2 <pb/>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, <f>[1]</f> as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.
2 Thessalonians 1-4 Therefore <f>ⓒ</f>we ourselves boast about you <f>ⓓ</f>in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith <f>ⓔ</f>in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring.
2 Thessalonians 1-5 <pb/>This is <f>ⓕ</f>evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be <f>ⓖ</f>considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering —
2 Thessalonians 1-6 since indeed God considers it <f>ⓗ</f>just <f>ⓘ</f>to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
2 Thessalonians 1-7 and to grant <f>ⓙ</f>relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when <f>ⓚ</f>the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven <f>ⓛ</f>with his mighty angels
2 Thessalonians 1-8 <f>ⓜ</f> in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those <f>ⓝ</f>who do not know God and on those who <f>ⓞ</f>do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
2 Thessalonians 1-9 They will suffer the punishment of <f>ⓟ</f>eternal destruction, <f>ⓠ</f>away from <f>[2]</f> the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
2 Thessalonians 1-10 <f>ⓡ</f> when he comes on <f>ⓢ</f>that day <f>ⓣ</f>to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our <f>ⓤ</f>testimony to you <f>ⓥ</f>was believed.
2 Thessalonians 1-11 To this end we <f>ⓦ</f>always pray for you, that our God may <f>ⓧ</f>make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every <f>ⓨ</f>work of faith by his power,
2 Thessalonians 1-12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus <f>ⓩ</f>may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
