Titus 1-1 <pb/>Paul, a servant <f>[1]</f> of God and <f>ⓐ</f>an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and <f>ⓑ</f>their knowledge of the truth, <f>ⓒ</f>which accords with godliness,
Titus 1-2 <f>ⓓ</f> in hope of eternal life, which God, <f>ⓔ</f>who never lies, <f>ⓕ</f>promised <f>ⓖ</f>before the ages began <f>[2]</f>
Titus 1-3 and <f>ⓗ</f>at the proper time manifested in his word <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>through the preaching <f>ⓙ</f>with which I have been entrusted <f>ⓚ</f>by the command of God our Savior;
Titus 1-4 <pb/>To Titus, <f>ⓛ</f>my true child in <f>ⓜ</f>a common faith: <pb/><f>ⓝ</f>Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
Titus 1-5 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and <f>ⓟ</f>appoint elders in every town as I directed you —
Titus 1-6 <f>ⓠ</f> if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, <f>[4]</f> and his children are believers <f>[5]</f> and not open to the charge of <f>ⓡ</f>debauchery or insubordination.
Titus 1-7 For an overseer, <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓢ</f>as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not <f>ⓣ</f>be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent <f>ⓤ</f>or greedy for gain,
Titus 1-8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, <f>ⓥ</f>and disciplined.
Titus 1-9 He must <f>ⓦ</f>hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in <f>ⓧ</f>sound <f>[7]</f> doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.
Titus 1-10 <pb/>For there are many who are insubordinate, <f>ⓨ</f>empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of <f>ⓩ</f>the circumcision party. <f>[8]</f>
Titus 1-11 They must be silenced, since <f>ⓐ</f>they are upsetting whole families by teaching <f>ⓑ</f>for shameful gain what they ought not to teach.
Titus 1-12 <f>ⓒ</f> One of the Cretans, <f>[9]</f> a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” <f>[10]</f>
Titus 1-13 This testimony is true. Therefore <f>ⓓ</f>rebuke them <f>ⓔ</f>sharply, that they <f>ⓕ</f>may be sound in the faith,
Titus 1-14 <f>ⓖ</f> not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and <f>ⓗ</f>the commands of people <f>ⓘ</f>who turn away from the truth.
Titus 1-15 <f>ⓙ</f> To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and <f>ⓚ</f>unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both <f>ⓛ</f>their minds and their consciences are defiled.
Titus 1-16 <f>ⓜ</f> They profess to know God, but they <f>ⓝ</f>deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, <f>ⓞ</f>unfit for any good work.
