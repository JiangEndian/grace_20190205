Revelation 11-1 <pb/>Then I was given <f>ⓐ</f>a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, “Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there,
Revelation 11-2 but do not measure <f>ⓑ</f>the court outside the temple; leave that out, for <f>ⓒ</f>it is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for <f>ⓓ</f>forty-two months.
Revelation 11-3 And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for <f>ⓔ</f>1,260 days, <f>ⓕ</f>clothed in sackcloth.”

Revelation 11-8 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically <f>[2]</f> is called <f>ⓞ</f>Sodom and <f>ⓟ</f>Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.
Revelation 11-9 For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and <f>ⓠ</f>refuse to let them be placed in a tomb,
Revelation 11-10 and <f>ⓡ</f>those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and <f>ⓢ</f>exchange presents, because these two prophets <f>ⓣ</f>had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth.

Revelation 11-13 And at that hour there was <f>ⓨ</f>a great earthquake, and <f>ⓩ</f>a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and <f>ⓐ</f>gave glory to <f>ⓑ</f>the God of heaven.

Revelation 11-16 And the twenty-four elders <f>ⓘ</f>who sit on their thrones before God <f>ⓙ</f>fell on their faces and worshiped God,
Revelation 11-17 saying, <pb/><t>“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>who is and who was, </t><t>for you have taken your great power </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>begun to reign.</t>
Revelation 11-18 <t>The nations raged, </t><t>but <f>ⓜ</f>your wrath came, </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>the time for the dead to be judged, </t><t>and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>those who fear your name, </t><t>both small and great, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>for destroying the destroyers of the earth.” </t>
