Matthew 13-1 <pb/>That same day Jesus went out of the house <f>ⓐ</f>and sat beside the sea.
Matthew 13-2 And great crowds gathered about him, <f>ⓑ</f>so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach.
Matthew 13-3 And <f>ⓒ</f>he told them many things in parables, saying: <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“A sower went out to sow.</J>
Matthew 13-4 <J>And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.</J>
Matthew 13-5 <J>Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,</J>
Matthew 13-6 <J>but <f>ⓔ</f>when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, <f>ⓕ</f>they withered away.</J>
Matthew 13-7 <J>Other seeds fell among <f>ⓖ</f>thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</J>
Matthew 13-8 <J>Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some <f>ⓗ</f>a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</J>
Matthew 13-9 <J><f>ⓘ</f> He who has ears, <f>[1]</f> let him hear.”</J>
Matthew 13-10 <pb/>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
Matthew 13-11 And he answered them, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“To you it has been given to know <f>ⓚ</f>the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</J>
Matthew 13-12 <J><f>ⓛ</f> For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, <f>ⓜ</f>even what he has will be taken away.</J>
Matthew 13-13 <J>This is why I speak to them in parables, because <f>ⓝ</f>seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, <f>ⓞ</f>nor do they understand.</J>
Matthew 13-14 <J>Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓟ</f>“‘“You will indeed hear but never understand,</J> </t><t><J>and you will indeed see but never perceive.”</J></t>
Matthew 13-15 <t><J>For this people's heart has grown dull,</J> </t><t><J>and with their ears <f>ⓠ</f>they can barely hear,</J> </t><t><J>and <f>ⓡ</f>their eyes they have closed,</J> </t><t><J>lest they should see with their eyes</J> </t><t><J>and hear with their ears</J> </t><t><J>and <f>ⓢ</f>understand with their heart</J> </t><t><J>and <f>ⓣ</f>turn, and I would heal them.’</J> </t>
Matthew 13-16 <pb/><J>But <f>ⓤ</f>blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.</J>
Matthew 13-17 <J><f>ⓥ</f> For truly, I say to you, <f>ⓦ</f>many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</J>
Matthew 13-18 <pb/><J><f>ⓧ</f> “Hear then the parable of the sower:</J>
Matthew 13-19 <J>When anyone hears the word of <f>ⓨ</f>the kingdom and <f>ⓩ</f>does not understand it, <f>ⓐ</f>the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.</J>
Matthew 13-20 <J>As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately <f>ⓑ</f>receives it with joy,</J>
Matthew 13-21 <J>yet he has no root in himself, but <f>ⓒ</f>endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately <f>ⓓ</f>he falls away. <f>[2]</f></J>
Matthew 13-22 <J>As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but <f>ⓔ</f>the cares of <f>ⓕ</f>the world and <f>ⓖ</f>the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</J>
Matthew 13-23 <J>As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and <f>ⓗ</f>understands it. He indeed <f>ⓘ</f>bears fruit and yields, in one case <f>ⓙ</f>a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”</J>
Matthew 13-24 <pb/>He put another parable before them, saying, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field,</J>
Matthew 13-25 <J>but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds <f>[3]</f> among the wheat and went away.</J>
Matthew 13-26 <J>So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.</J>
Matthew 13-27 <J>And the servants <f>[4]</f> of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’</J>
Matthew 13-28 <J>He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’</J>
Matthew 13-29 <J>But he said, <f>ⓛ</f>‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them.</J>
Matthew 13-30 <J>Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, <f>ⓜ</f>“Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</J>
Matthew 13-31 <pb/>He put another parable before them, saying, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“The kingdom of heaven is like <f>ⓞ</f>a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.</J>
Matthew 13-32 <J>It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”</J>
Matthew 13-33 <pb/>He told them another parable. <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in <f>ⓠ</f>three measures of flour, till it was <f>ⓡ</f>all leavened.”</J>
Matthew 13-34 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable.
Matthew 13-35 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: <f>[5]</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“I will open my mouth in parables; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>I will utter what has been hidden <f>ⓥ</f>since the foundation of the world.” </t>
Matthew 13-36 <pb/>Then he left the crowds and went into <f>ⓦ</f>the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, <f>ⓧ</f>“Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.”
Matthew 13-37 He answered, <J>“The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</J>
Matthew 13-38 <J>The field is the world, and the good seed is <f>ⓨ</f>the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are <f>ⓩ</f>the sons of the evil one,</J>
Matthew 13-39 <J>and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. <f>ⓐ</f>The harvest is <f>ⓑ</f>the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.</J>
Matthew 13-40 <J>Just as the weeds <f>ⓒ</f>are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at <f>ⓓ</f>the end of the age.</J>
Matthew 13-41 <J><f>ⓔ</f> The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all <f>ⓕ</f>causes of sin and <f>ⓖ</f>all law-breakers,</J>
Matthew 13-42 <J><f>ⓗ</f> and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place <f>ⓘ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</J>
Matthew 13-43 <J>Then <f>ⓙ</f>the righteous will shine like the sun <f>ⓚ</f>in the kingdom of their Father. <f>ⓛ</f>He who has ears, let him hear.</J>
Matthew 13-44 <pb/><J>“The kingdom of heaven <f>ⓜ</f>is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy <f>ⓝ</f>he goes and sells all that he has and <f>ⓞ</f>buys that field.</J>
Matthew 13-45 <pb/><J>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,</J>
Matthew 13-46 <J>who, on finding <f>ⓟ</f>one pearl of great value, <f>ⓠ</f>went and sold all that he had and <f>ⓡ</f>bought it.</J>
Matthew 13-47 <pb/><J>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is <f>ⓢ</f>like a net that was thrown into the sea and <f>ⓣ</f>gathered fish of every kind.</J>
Matthew 13-48 <J>When it was full, <f>ⓤ</f>men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad.</J>
Matthew 13-49 <J>So it will be at <f>ⓥ</f>the end of the age. The angels will come out and <f>ⓦ</f>separate the evil from the righteous</J>
Matthew 13-50 <J><f>ⓧ</f> and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place <f>ⓨ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</J>
Matthew 13-51 <pb/><J><f>ⓩ</f> “Have you understood all these things?”</J> They said to him, “Yes.”
Matthew 13-52 And he said to them, <J>“Therefore every <f>ⓐ</f>scribe <f>ⓑ</f>who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who <f>ⓒ</f>brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”</J>
Matthew 13-53 <pb/>And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there,
Matthew 13-54 <f>ⓓ</f> and coming to <f>ⓔ</f>his hometown <f>ⓕ</f>he taught them in their synagogue, so that <f>ⓖ</f>they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?
Matthew 13-55 <f>ⓗ</f> Is not this <f>ⓘ</f>the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not <f>ⓙ</f>his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Matthew 13-56 And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?”
Matthew 13-57 And <f>ⓚ</f>they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.”</J>
Matthew 13-58 And he did not do many mighty works there, <f>ⓜ</f>because of their unbelief.
