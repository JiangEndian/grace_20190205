Revelation 5-1 <pb/>Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne <f>ⓐ</f>a scroll written within and on the back, <f>ⓑ</f>sealed with seven seals.
Revelation 5-2 And <f>ⓒ</f>I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”
Revelation 5-3 And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it,
Revelation 5-4 and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
Revelation 5-5 And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, <f>ⓓ</f>the Lion <f>ⓔ</f>of the tribe of Judah, <f>ⓕ</f>the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”
Revelation 5-6 <pb/>And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw <f>ⓖ</f>a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with <f>ⓗ</f>seven eyes, which are <f>ⓘ</f>the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
Revelation 5-7 And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
Revelation 5-8 And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders <f>ⓙ</f>fell down before the Lamb, <f>ⓚ</f>each holding a harp, and <f>ⓛ</f>golden bowls full of incense, <f>ⓜ</f>which are the prayers of the saints.
Revelation 5-9 And they sang <f>ⓝ</f>a new song, saying, <pb/><t>“Worthy are you to take the scroll </t><t>and to open its seals, </t><t>for <f>ⓞ</f>you were slain, and by your blood <f>ⓟ</f>you ransomed people for God </t><t>from <f>ⓠ</f>every tribe and language and people and nation,</t>
Revelation 5-10 <t>and you have made them <f>ⓡ</f>a kingdom and priests to our God, </t><t>and they shall reign on the earth.” </t>
Revelation 5-11 <pb/>Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering <f>ⓢ</f>myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
Revelation 5-12 saying with a loud voice, <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, </t><t>to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might </t><t>and honor and glory and blessing!” </t>
Revelation 5-13 <pb/>And I heard <f>ⓤ</f>every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, <pb/><t>“To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb </t><t>be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!” </t>
Revelation 5-14 <pb/>And the four living creatures <f>ⓥ</f>said, “Amen!” and the elders <f>ⓦ</f>fell down and worshiped.
