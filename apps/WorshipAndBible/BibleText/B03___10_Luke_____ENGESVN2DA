Luke 10-1 <pb/>After this the Lord appointed <f>ⓐ</f>seventy-two <f>[1]</f> others and <f>ⓑ</f>sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.
Luke 10-2 <f>ⓒ</f> And he said to them, <J>“The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. <f>ⓓ</f>Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.</J>
Luke 10-3 <J>Go your way; <f>ⓔ</f>behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.</J>
Luke 10-4 <J><f>ⓕ</f> Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and <f>ⓖ</f>greet no one on the road.</J>
Luke 10-5 <J>Whatever house you enter, first say, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Peace be to this house!’</J>
Luke 10-6 <J>And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, <f>ⓘ</f>it will return to you.</J>
Luke 10-7 <J>And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for <f>ⓙ</f>the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house.</J>
Luke 10-8 <J>Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you.</J>
Luke 10-9 <J>Heal the sick in it and say to them, <f>ⓚ</f>‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’</J>
Luke 10-10 <J>But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,</J>
Luke 10-11 <J><f>ⓛ</f> ‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that <f>ⓜ</f>the kingdom of God has come near.’</J>
Luke 10-12 <J>I tell you, <f>ⓝ</f>it will be more bearable on <f>ⓞ</f>that day for Sodom than for that town.</J>
Luke 10-13 <pb/><J><f>ⓟ</f> “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in <f>ⓠ</f>Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</J>
Luke 10-14 <J><f>ⓡ</f> But it will be more bearable in the judgment for <f>ⓢ</f>Tyre and Sidon than for you.</J>
Luke 10-15 <J>And you, Capernaum, <f>ⓣ</f>will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to <f>ⓤ</f>Hades.</J>
Luke 10-16 <pb/><J><f>ⓥ</f> “The one who hears you hears me, and <f>ⓦ</f>the one who rejects you rejects me, and <f>ⓧ</f>the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me.”</J>
Luke 10-17 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, <f>ⓩ</f>even the demons are subject to us in your name!”
Luke 10-18 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“I saw Satan <f>ⓑ</f>fall like lightning from heaven.</J>
Luke 10-19 <J>Behold, I have given you authority <f>ⓒ</f>to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of <f>ⓓ</f>the enemy, and <f>ⓔ</f>nothing shall hurt you.</J>
Luke 10-20 <J><f>ⓕ</f> Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that <f>ⓖ</f>your names are written in heaven.”</J>
Luke 10-21 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> In that same hour <f>ⓘ</f>he rejoiced <f>ⓙ</f>in the Holy Spirit and said, <J>“I thank you, Father, <f>ⓚ</f>Lord of heaven and earth, that <f>ⓛ</f>you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and <f>ⓜ</f>revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for <f>ⓝ</f>such was your gracious will. <f>[2]</f></J>
Luke 10-22 <J><f>ⓞ</f> All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is <f>ⓟ</f>except the Father, or who the Father is <f>ⓠ</f>except the Son and anyone <f>ⓡ</f>to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”</J>
Luke 10-23 <pb/>Then turning to the disciples he said privately, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!</J>
Luke 10-24 <J>For I tell you <f>ⓣ</f>that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.”</J>
Luke 10-25 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> And behold, a <f>ⓥ</f>lawyer stood up to <f>ⓦ</f>put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to <f>ⓧ</f>inherit eternal life?”
Luke 10-26 He said to him, <J>“What is written in the Law? How do you read it?”</J>
Luke 10-27 And he answered, <f>ⓨ</f>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and <f>ⓩ</f>your neighbor as yourself.”
Luke 10-28 And he said to him, <J>“You have answered correctly; <f>ⓐ</f>do this, and you will live.”</J>
Luke 10-29 <pb/>But he, <f>ⓑ</f>desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”
Luke 10-30 Jesus replied, <J>“A man <f>ⓒ</f>was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead.</J>
Luke 10-31 <J>Now by chance a <f>ⓓ</f>priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.</J>
Luke 10-32 <J>So likewise <f>ⓔ</f>a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</J>
Luke 10-33 <J>But a <f>ⓕ</f>Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion.</J>
Luke 10-34 <J>He went to him and <f>ⓖ</f>bound up his wounds, pouring on <f>ⓗ</f>oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.</J>
Luke 10-35 <J>And the next day he took out two <f>ⓘ</f>denarii <f>[3]</f> and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.’</J>
Luke 10-36 <J>Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?”</J>
Luke 10-37 He said, “The one who showed him mercy.” And Jesus said to him, <J>“You go, and do likewise.”</J>
Luke 10-38 <pb/>Now as they went on their way, Jesus <f>[4]</f> entered a village. And a woman named <f>ⓙ</f>Martha <f>ⓚ</f>welcomed him into her house.
Luke 10-39 And she had a sister called <f>ⓛ</f>Mary, who <f>ⓜ</f>sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.
Luke 10-40 But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.”
Luke 10-41 But the Lord answered her, <J>“Martha, Martha, you are <f>ⓝ</f>anxious and troubled about many things,</J>
Luke 10-42 <J>but one thing is necessary. <f>[5]</f> Mary has chosen <f>ⓞ</f>the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.”</J>
