Titus 2-1 <pb/>But as for you, teach what accords with <f>ⓐ</f>sound <f>[1]</f> doctrine.
Titus 2-2 Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, <f>ⓑ</f>sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.
Titus 2-3 <f>ⓒ</f> Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, <f>ⓓ</f>not slanderers <f>ⓔ</f>or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good,
Titus 2-4 and so train the young women to love their husbands and children,
Titus 2-5 to be self-controlled, <f>ⓕ</f>pure, <f>ⓖ</f>working at home, kind, and <f>ⓗ</f>submissive to their own husbands, <f>ⓘ</f>that the word of God may not be reviled.
Titus 2-6 Likewise, urge <f>ⓙ</f>the younger men to be self-controlled.
Titus 2-7 Show yourself in all respects to be <f>ⓚ</f>a model of good works, and in your teaching <f>ⓛ</f>show integrity, <f>ⓜ</f>dignity,
Titus 2-8 and <f>ⓝ</f>sound speech that cannot be condemned, <f>ⓞ</f>so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.
Titus 2-9 <f>ⓟ</f> Bondservants <f>[2]</f> are to be submissive to their own masters <f>ⓠ</f>in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,
Titus 2-10 not pilfering, <f>ⓡ</f>but showing all good faith, <f>ⓢ</f>so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.
Titus 2-11 <pb/>For <f>ⓣ</f>the grace of God <f>ⓤ</f>has appeared, bringing salvation <f>ⓥ</f>for all people,
Titus 2-12 training us to renounce ungodliness and <f>ⓦ</f>worldly passions, and <f>ⓧ</f>to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in <f>ⓨ</f>the present age,
Titus 2-13 <f>ⓩ</f> waiting for our blessed <f>ⓐ</f>hope, the <f>ⓑ</f>appearing of the glory of our great <f>ⓒ</f>God and Savior Jesus Christ,
Titus 2-14 <f>ⓓ</f> who gave himself for us to <f>ⓔ</f>redeem us from all lawlessness and <f>ⓕ</f>to purify for himself <f>ⓖ</f>a people for his own possession who are <f>ⓗ</f>zealous for good works.
Titus 2-15 <pb/>Declare these things; exhort and <f>ⓘ</f>rebuke with all authority. <f>ⓙ</f>Let no one disregard you.
