Revelation 7-1 <pb/>After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back <f>ⓐ</f>the four winds of the earth, <f>ⓑ</f>that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree.
Revelation 7-2 Then I saw another angel ascending <f>ⓒ</f>from the rising of the sun, with <f>ⓓ</f>the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea,
Revelation 7-3 saying, <f>ⓔ</f>“Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God <f>ⓕ</f>on their foreheads.”
Revelation 7-4 And <f>ⓖ</f>I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:
Revelation 7-5 <pb/><t>12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed, </t><t>12,000 from the tribe of Reuben, </t><t>12,000 from the tribe of Gad,</t>
Revelation 7-6 <t>12,000 from the tribe of Asher, </t><t>12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali, </t><t>12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,</t>
Revelation 7-7 <t>12,000 from the tribe of Simeon, </t><t>12,000 from the tribe of Levi, </t><t>12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,</t>
Revelation 7-8 <t>12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun, </t><t>12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, </t><t>12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed. </t>
Revelation 7-9 <pb/>After this I looked, and behold, <f>ⓗ</f>a great multitude that no one could number, <f>ⓘ</f>from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, <f>ⓙ</f>clothed in white robes, with <f>ⓚ</f>palm branches in their hands,
Revelation 7-10 and crying out with a loud voice, <f>ⓛ</f>“Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”
Revelation 7-11 And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and <f>ⓜ</f>the four living creatures, and they <f>ⓝ</f>fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
Revelation 7-12 <f>ⓞ</f> saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”
Revelation 7-13 <pb/>Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, <f>ⓟ</f>clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?”
Revelation 7-14 I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of <f>ⓠ</f>the great tribulation. <f>ⓡ</f>They have washed their robes and <f>ⓢ</f>made them white <f>ⓣ</f>in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation 7-15 <pb/><t>“Therefore they are before the throne of God, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>serve him day and night in his temple; </t><t>and he who sits on the throne <f>ⓥ</f>will shelter them with his presence.</t>
Revelation 7-16 <t><f>ⓦ</f> They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>the sun shall not strike them, </t><t>nor any scorching heat.</t>
Revelation 7-17 <t>For the Lamb in the midst of the throne <f>ⓨ</f>will be their shepherd, </t><t>and he will guide them to springs of <f>ⓩ</f>living water, </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.” </t>
