1 Timothy 3-1 <pb/>The saying is <f>ⓐ</f>trustworthy: If anyone aspires to <f>ⓑ</f>the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.
1 Timothy 3-2 Therefore <f>ⓒ</f>an overseer <f>[1]</f> must be above reproach, <f>ⓓ</f>the husband of one wife, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, <f>ⓕ</f>hospitable, <f>ⓖ</f>able to teach,
1 Timothy 3-3 not a drunkard, not violent but <f>ⓗ</f>gentle, not quarrelsome, <f>ⓘ</f>not a lover of money.
1 Timothy 3-4 He must manage his own household well, with all dignity <f>ⓙ</f>keeping his children submissive,
1 Timothy 3-5 for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for <f>ⓚ</f>God's church?
1 Timothy 3-6 He must not be a recent convert, or he may <f>ⓛ</f>become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
1 Timothy 3-7 Moreover, he must be well thought of by <f>ⓜ</f>outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into <f>ⓝ</f>a snare of the devil.
1 Timothy 3-8 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>not addicted to much wine, <f>ⓠ</f>not greedy for dishonest gain.
1 Timothy 3-9 They must <f>ⓡ</f>hold the mystery of the faith with <f>ⓢ</f>a clear conscience.
1 Timothy 3-10 And <f>ⓣ</f>let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.
1 Timothy 3-11 <f>ⓤ</f> Their wives likewise <f>[4]</f> must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, <f>ⓥ</f>faithful in all things.
1 Timothy 3-12 Let deacons each be <f>ⓦ</f>the husband of one wife, <f>ⓧ</f>managing their children and their own households well.
1 Timothy 3-13 For <f>ⓨ</f>those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy 3-14 <pb/>I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that,
1 Timothy 3-15 if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth.
1 Timothy 3-16 Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f>He <f>[5]</f> was manifested in the flesh, </t><t>vindicated <f>[6]</f> by the Spirit, <f>[7]</f> </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>seen by angels, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>proclaimed among the nations, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>believed on in the world, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>taken up in glory. </t>
