Luke 18-1 <pb/>And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought <f>ⓐ</f>always to pray and not <f>ⓑ</f>lose heart.
Luke 18-2 He said, <J>“In a certain city there was a judge who <f>ⓒ</f>neither feared God nor respected man.</J>
Luke 18-3 <J>And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’</J>
Luke 18-4 <J>For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man,</J>
Luke 18-5 <J>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’”</J>
Luke 18-6 And the Lord said, <J>“Hear what the unrighteous judge says.</J>
Luke 18-7 <J>And <f>ⓔ</f>will not God give justice to <f>ⓕ</f>his elect, <f>ⓖ</f>who cry to him day and night? <f>ⓗ</f> <f>ⓘ</f>Will he delay long over them?</J>
Luke 18-8 <J>I tell you, he will give justice to them <f>ⓙ</f>speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, <f>ⓚ</f>will he find faith on earth?”</J>
Luke 18-9 <pb/>He also told this parable to some <f>ⓛ</f>who trusted <f>ⓜ</f>in themselves that they were righteous, <f>ⓝ</f>and treated others with contempt:
Luke 18-10 <J>“Two men <f>ⓞ</f>went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</J>
Luke 18-11 <J>The Pharisee, <f>ⓟ</f>standing by himself, prayed <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓠ</f>thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</J>
Luke 18-12 <J><f>ⓡ</f> I fast twice a week; <f>ⓢ</f>I give tithes of all that I get.’</J>
Luke 18-13 <J>But the tax collector, <f>ⓣ</f>standing far off, <f>ⓤ</f>would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but <f>ⓥ</f>beat his breast, saying, ‘God, <f>ⓦ</f>be merciful to me, a sinner!’</J>
Luke 18-14 <J>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For <f>ⓧ</f>everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</J>
Luke 18-15 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they <f>ⓩ</f>rebuked them.
Luke 18-16 But Jesus called them to him, saying, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“Let the children come to me, and <f>ⓑ</f>do not hinder them, <f>ⓒ</f>for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</J>
Luke 18-17 <J><f>ⓓ</f> Truly, I say to you, whoever does not <f>ⓔ</f>receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”</J>
Luke 18-18 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to <f>ⓖ</f>inherit eternal life?”
Luke 18-19 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</J>
Luke 18-20 <J>You know the commandments: <f>ⓗ</f>‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’”</J>
Luke 18-21 And he said, <f>ⓘ</f>“All these I have kept from my youth.”
Luke 18-22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, <J>“One thing you still lack. <f>ⓙ</f>Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have <f>ⓚ</f>treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</J>
Luke 18-23 <f>ⓛ</f> But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.
Luke 18-24 Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter <f>ⓝ</f>the kingdom of God!</J>
Luke 18-25 <J>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter <f>ⓞ</f>the kingdom of God.”</J>
Luke 18-26 Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”
Luke 18-27 But he said, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</J>
Luke 18-28 And Peter said, “See, <f>ⓠ</f>we have left our homes and followed you.”
Luke 18-29 And he said to them, <J>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓡ</f>there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers <f>[2]</f> or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</J>
Luke 18-30 <J>who will not receive <f>ⓢ</f>many times more <f>ⓣ</f>in this time, and in <f>ⓤ</f>the age to come eternal life.”</J>
Luke 18-31 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> And taking the twelve, he said to them, <J>“See, <f>ⓦ</f>we are going up to Jerusalem, and <f>ⓧ</f>everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.</J>
Luke 18-32 <J>For he will be <f>ⓨ</f>delivered over to the Gentiles and will be <f>ⓩ</f>mocked and shamefully treated and <f>ⓐ</f>spit upon.</J>
Luke 18-33 <J>And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on <f>ⓑ</f>the third day he will rise.”</J>
Luke 18-34 <f>ⓒ</f> But they understood none of these things. <f>ⓓ</f>This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.
Luke 18-35 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> As he drew near to Jericho, <f>ⓕ</f>a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
Luke 18-36 And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant.
Luke 18-37 They told him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”
Luke 18-38 And he cried out, “Jesus, <f>ⓗ</f>Son of David, have mercy on me!”
Luke 18-39 And those who were in front <f>ⓘ</f>rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
Luke 18-40 And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,
Luke 18-41 <J><f>ⓙ</f> “What do you want me to do for you?”</J> He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.”
Luke 18-42 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Recover your sight; <f>ⓚ</f>your faith has <f>ⓛ</f>made you well.”</J>
Luke 18-43 And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, <f>ⓜ</f>glorifying God. And <f>ⓝ</f>all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
