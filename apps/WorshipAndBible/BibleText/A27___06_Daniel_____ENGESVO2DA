Daniel 6-1 <pb/>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom <f>ⓐ</f>120 <f>ⓑ</f>satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom;
Daniel 6-2 and over them <f>ⓒ</f>three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these <f>ⓓ</f>satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss.
Daniel 6-3 Then this Daniel became <f>ⓔ</f>distinguished above all <f>ⓕ</f>the other high officials and <f>ⓖ</f>satraps, because <f>ⓗ</f>an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned <f>ⓘ</f>to set him over the whole kingdom.
Daniel 6-4 Then <f>ⓙ</f>the high officials and <f>ⓚ</f>the satraps <f>ⓛ</f>sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, <f>ⓜ</f>but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, <f>ⓝ</f>and no error or fault was found in him.
Daniel 6-5 Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”
Daniel 6-6 <pb/>Then these <f>ⓞ</f>high officials and <f>ⓟ</f>satraps came by agreement <f>[1]</f> to the king and said to him, “O <f>ⓠ</f>King Darius, live forever!
Daniel 6-7 All the <f>ⓡ</f>high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the <f>ⓢ</f>counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an <f>ⓣ</f>injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.
Daniel 6-8 Now, O king, establish <f>ⓤ</f>the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to <f>ⓥ</f>the law of <f>ⓦ</f>the Medes and the Persians, <f>ⓧ</f>which cannot be revoked.”
Daniel 6-9 Therefore King Darius signed the document and <f>ⓨ</f>injunction.
Daniel 6-10 <pb/>When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where <f>ⓩ</f>he had windows in his upper chamber open <f>ⓐ</f>toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees <f>ⓑ</f>three times a day and prayed and <f>ⓒ</f>gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.
Daniel 6-11 Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God.
Daniel 6-12 Then they <f>ⓓ</f>came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, “O king! Did you not sign <f>ⓔ</f>an injunction, that anyone who makes petition to any god or man within thirty days except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?” The king answered and said, “The thing stands fast, according to the law of <f>ⓕ</f>the Medes and Persians, <f>ⓖ</f>which cannot be revoked.”
Daniel 6-13 Then they answered and said before the king, <f>ⓗ</f>“Daniel, who is one <f>ⓘ</f>of the exiles <f>ⓙ</f>from Judah, <f>ⓚ</f>pays no attention to you, O king, or <f>ⓛ</f>the injunction you have signed, but makes his petition <f>ⓜ</f>three times a day.”
Daniel 6-14 <pb/>Then <f>ⓝ</f>the king, when he heard these words, <f>ⓞ</f>was much distressed and set his mind to deliver Daniel. And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him.
Daniel 6-15 Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no <f>ⓟ</f>injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.”
Daniel 6-16 <pb/>Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions. The king declared <f>[2]</f> to Daniel, “May <f>ⓠ</f>your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!”
Daniel 6-17 <f>ⓡ</f> And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, <f>ⓢ</f>and the king sealed it <f>ⓣ</f>with his own signet and with the signet of his <f>ⓤ</f>lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
Daniel 6-18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; <f>ⓥ</f>no diversions were brought to him, and <f>ⓦ</f>sleep fled from him.
Daniel 6-19 <pb/>Then, at break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the den of lions.
Daniel 6-20 As he came near to the den where Daniel was, he cried out in a tone of anguish. The king declared to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of <f>ⓧ</f>the living God, <f>ⓨ</f>has your God, whom you serve continually, <f>ⓩ</f>been able to deliver you from the lions?”
Daniel 6-21 Then Daniel said to the king, <f>ⓐ</f>“O king, live forever!
Daniel 6-22 My God <f>ⓑ</f>sent his angel <f>ⓒ</f>and shut the lions' mouths, and they have not harmed me, because I was found blameless <f>ⓓ</f>before him; <f>ⓔ</f>and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”
Daniel 6-23 Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and <f>ⓕ</f>no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
Daniel 6-24 And the king commanded, and <f>ⓖ</f>those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the den of lions — they, their children, and their wives. And before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces.
Daniel 6-25 <pb/>Then King Darius wrote to all <f>ⓗ</f>the peoples, nations, and languages <f>ⓘ</f>that dwell in all the earth: <f>ⓙ</f>“Peace be multiplied to you.
Daniel 6-26 <f>ⓚ</f> I make a decree, that in all my royal dominion <f>ⓛ</f>people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, <pb/><t>for <f>ⓜ</f>he is <f>ⓝ</f>the living God, </t><t>enduring forever; </t><t>his kingdom shall never be destroyed, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and his dominion shall be <f>ⓟ</f>to the end.</t>
Daniel 6-27 <t>He delivers and rescues; </t><t>he works <f>ⓠ</f>signs and wonders </t><t>in heaven and on earth, </t><t>he who has <f>ⓡ</f>saved Daniel </t><t>from the power of the lions.” </t>
Daniel 6-28 <pb/>So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and <f>ⓢ</f>the reign of <f>ⓣ</f>Cyrus the Persian.
