Ephesians 2-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And you were <f>ⓑ</f>dead in the trespasses and sins
Ephesians 2-2 <f>ⓒ</f> in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following <f>ⓓ</f>the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in <f>ⓔ</f>the sons of disobedience —
Ephesians 2-3 among whom we all once lived in <f>ⓕ</f>the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body <f>[1]</f> and the mind, and <f>ⓖ</f>were by nature <f>ⓗ</f>children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. <f>[2]</f>
Ephesians 2-4 But <f>[3]</f> God, being <f>ⓘ</f>rich in mercy, <f>ⓙ</f>because of the great love with which he loved us,
Ephesians 2-5 even <f>ⓚ</f>when we were dead in our trespasses, <f>ⓛ</f>made us alive together with Christ — <f>ⓜ</f>by grace you have been saved —
Ephesians 2-6 and raised us up with him and <f>ⓝ</f>seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
Ephesians 2-7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable <f>ⓞ</f>riches of his grace in <f>ⓟ</f>kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians 2-8 For <f>ⓠ</f>by grace you have been saved <f>ⓡ</f>through faith. And this is <f>ⓢ</f>not your own doing; <f>ⓣ</f>it is the gift of God,
Ephesians 2-9 <f>ⓤ</f> not a result of works, <f>ⓥ</f>so that no one may boast.
Ephesians 2-10 For <f>ⓦ</f>we are his workmanship, <f>ⓧ</f>created in Christ Jesus <f>ⓨ</f>for good works, <f>ⓩ</f>which God prepared beforehand, <f>ⓐ</f>that we should walk in them.
Ephesians 2-11 <pb/>Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called <f>ⓑ</f>the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands —
Ephesians 2-12 remember <f>ⓒ</f>that you were at that time separated from Christ, <f>ⓓ</f>alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to <f>ⓔ</f>the covenants of promise, <f>ⓕ</f>having no hope and without God in the world.
Ephesians 2-13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were <f>ⓖ</f>far off have been brought near <f>ⓗ</f>by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians 2-14 For <f>ⓘ</f>he himself is our peace, <f>ⓙ</f>who has made us both one and has broken down <f>ⓚ</f>in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
Ephesians 2-15 by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in <f>ⓛ</f>ordinances, that he might create in himself one <f>ⓜ</f>new man in place of the two, so making peace,
Ephesians 2-16 and might <f>ⓝ</f>reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
Ephesians 2-17 And he came and <f>ⓞ</f>preached peace to you who were <f>ⓟ</f>far off and peace to those who were <f>ⓠ</f>near.
Ephesians 2-18 For <f>ⓡ</f>through him we both have <f>ⓢ</f>access in <f>ⓣ</f>one Spirit to the Father.
Ephesians 2-19 So then you are no longer <f>ⓤ</f>strangers and aliens, <f>[4]</f> but you are <f>ⓥ</f>fellow citizens with the saints and <f>ⓦ</f>members of the household of God,
Ephesians 2-20 <f>ⓧ</f> built on the foundation of the <f>ⓨ</f>apostles and prophets, <f>ⓩ</f>Christ Jesus himself being <f>ⓐ</f>the cornerstone,
Ephesians 2-21 <f>ⓑ</f> in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into <f>ⓒ</f>a holy temple in the Lord.
Ephesians 2-22 In him <f>ⓓ</f>you also are being built together <f>ⓔ</f>into a dwelling place for God by <f>[5]</f> the Spirit.
