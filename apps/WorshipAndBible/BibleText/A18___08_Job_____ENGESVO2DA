Job 8-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Job 8-2 <pb/><t>“How long will you say these things, </t><t>and the words of your mouth be a <f>ⓑ</f>great wind?</t>
Job 8-3 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Does God pervert justice? </t><t>Or does the Almighty pervert the right?</t>
Job 8-4 <t>If your <f>ⓓ</f>children have sinned against him, </t><t>he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.</t>
Job 8-5 <t>If you will seek God </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>plead with the Almighty for mercy,</t>
Job 8-6 <t>if you are pure and upright, </t><t>surely then he will <f>ⓕ</f>rouse himself for you </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>restore your rightful habitation.</t>
Job 8-7 <t>And though your beginning was small, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>your latter days will be very great. </t>
Job 8-8 <pb/><t>“For <f>ⓘ</f>inquire, please, of bygone ages, </t><t>and consider what <f>ⓙ</f>the fathers have searched out.</t>
Job 8-9 <t>For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, </t><t>for our days on earth are <f>ⓚ</f>a shadow.</t>
Job 8-10 <t>Will they not teach you and tell you </t><t>and utter words out of their understanding? </t>
Job 8-11 <pb/><t>“Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? </t><t>Can reeds flourish where there is no water?</t>
Job 8-12 <t>While yet in flower and not cut down, </t><t>they <f>ⓛ</f>wither before any other plant.</t>
Job 8-13 <t>Such are the paths of all who <f>ⓜ</f>forget God; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>the hope of <f>ⓞ</f>the godless shall perish.</t>
Job 8-14 <t>His confidence is severed, </t><t>and his trust is <f>ⓟ</f>a spider's web. <f>[1]</f></t>
Job 8-15 <t>He leans against his <f>ⓠ</f>house, but it does not stand; </t><t>he lays hold of it, but it does not endure.</t>
Job 8-16 <t>He is a lush plant before the sun, </t><t>and his <f>ⓡ</f>shoots spread over his garden.</t>
Job 8-17 <t>His roots entwine the stone heap; </t><t>he looks upon a house of stones.</t>
Job 8-18 <t>If he is destroyed from his <f>ⓢ</f>place, </t><t>then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have never <f>ⓣ</f>seen you.’</t>
Job 8-19 <t>Behold, this is the joy of his way, </t><t>and out of <f>ⓤ</f>the soil others will spring. </t>
Job 8-20 <pb/><t>“Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, </t><t>nor take the hand of evildoers.</t>
Job 8-21 <t>He will yet <f>ⓥ</f>fill your mouth with laughter, </t><t>and your lips with shouting.</t>
Job 8-22 <t>Those who hate you will be <f>ⓦ</f>clothed with shame, </t><t>and the tent of the wicked will be no more.” </t>
