Jeremiah 42-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>all the commanders of the forces, and <f>ⓑ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Hoshaiah, and all the people <f>ⓓ</f>from the least to the greatest, came near
Jeremiah 42-2 and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Let <f>ⓔ</f>our plea for mercy come before you, and <f>ⓕ</f>pray to the LORD your God for us, for all <f>ⓖ</f>this remnant — <f>ⓗ</f>because we are left with but a few, as your eyes see us —
Jeremiah 42-3 that <f>ⓘ</f>the LORD your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that we should do.”
Jeremiah 42-4 Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your request, and <f>ⓙ</f>whatever the LORD answers you I will tell you. <f>ⓚ</f>I will keep nothing back from you.”
Jeremiah 42-5 Then they said to Jeremiah, <f>ⓛ</f>“May the LORD be a true and <f>ⓜ</f>faithful witness against us <f>ⓝ</f>if we do not act according to all the word <f>ⓞ</f>with which the LORD your God sends you to us.
Jeremiah 42-6 Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, <f>ⓟ</f>that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.”
Jeremiah 42-7 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> At the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah 42-8 Then he summoned <f>ⓡ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓢ</f>all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people <f>ⓣ</f>from the least to the greatest,
Jeremiah 42-9 and said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓤ</f>to whom you sent me to present your plea for mercy before him:
Jeremiah 42-10 If you will remain in this land, <f>ⓥ</f>then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; <f>ⓦ</f>for I relent of the disaster that I did to you.
Jeremiah 42-11 <f>ⓧ</f> Do not fear the king of Babylon, <f>ⓨ</f>of whom you are afraid. <f>ⓩ</f>Do not fear him, declares the LORD, <f>ⓐ</f>for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his hand.
Jeremiah 42-12 <f>ⓑ</f> I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land.
Jeremiah 42-13 <f>ⓒ</f> But if you say, ‘We will not remain in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the LORD your God
Jeremiah 42-14 and saying, ‘No, <f>ⓓ</f>we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war or <f>ⓔ</f>hear the sound of the trumpet or <f>ⓕ</f>be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,’
Jeremiah 42-15 then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓖ</f>If you set your faces to enter Egypt <f>ⓗ</f>and go to live there,
Jeremiah 42-16 then the sword <f>ⓘ</f>that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt, <f>ⓙ</f>and there you shall die.
Jeremiah 42-17 All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. They shall have <f>ⓚ</f>no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them.
Jeremiah 42-18 <pb/>“For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓛ</f>As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. <f>ⓜ</f>You shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. You shall see this place no more.
Jeremiah 42-19 The LORD has said to you, O remnant of Judah, <f>ⓝ</f>‘Do not go to Egypt.’ <f>ⓞ</f>Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day
Jeremiah 42-20 that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. <f>ⓟ</f>For you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Pray for us to the LORD our God, and <f>ⓡ</f>whatever the LORD our God says, declare to us and we will do it.’
Jeremiah 42-21 And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything <f>ⓢ</f>that he sent me to tell you.
Jeremiah 42-22 <f>ⓣ</f> Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.”
