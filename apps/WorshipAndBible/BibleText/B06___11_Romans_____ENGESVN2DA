Romans 11-1 <pb/>I ask, then, <f>ⓐ</f>has God rejected his people? By no means! For <f>ⓑ</f>I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, <f>[1]</f> a member of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans 11-2 <f>ⓒ</f> God has not rejected his people whom he <f>ⓓ</f>foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?
Romans 11-3 <f>ⓔ</f> “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.”
Romans 11-4 But what is God's reply to him? <f>ⓕ</f>“I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
Romans 11-5 So too at the present time there is <f>ⓖ</f>a remnant, chosen by grace.
Romans 11-6 <f>ⓗ</f> But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
Romans 11-7 <pb/>What then? <f>ⓘ</f>Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest <f>ⓙ</f>were hardened,
Romans 11-8 as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“God gave them a spirit of stupor, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>eyes that would not see </t><t>and ears that would not hear, </t><t>down to this very day.” </t>
Romans 11-9 <pb/>And David says, <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“Let their table become a snare and a trap, </t><t>a stumbling block and a retribution for them;</t>
Romans 11-10 <t>let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, </t><t>and bend their backs forever.” </t>
Romans 11-11 <pb/>So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather, through their trespass <f>ⓝ</f>salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.
Romans 11-12 Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion <f>[2]</f> mean!
Romans 11-13 <pb/>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as <f>ⓞ</f>I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry
Romans 11-14 in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and <f>ⓟ</f>thus save some of them.
Romans 11-15 For if their rejection means <f>ⓠ</f>the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
Romans 11-16 <f>ⓡ</f> If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
Romans 11-17 <pb/>But if <f>ⓢ</f>some of the branches were broken off, and you, <f>ⓣ</f>although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root <f>[3]</f> of the olive tree,
Romans 11-18 do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.
Romans 11-19 Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”
Romans 11-20 That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you <f>ⓤ</f>stand fast through faith. So <f>ⓥ</f>do not become proud, but <f>ⓦ</f>fear.
Romans 11-21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
Romans 11-22 Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, <f>ⓧ</f>provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise <f>ⓨ</f>you too will be cut off.
Romans 11-23 And <f>ⓩ</f>even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
Romans 11-24 For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.
Romans 11-25 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>a partial hardening has come upon Israel, <f>ⓒ</f>until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
Romans 11-26 And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“The Deliverer will come <f>ⓔ</f>from Zion, </t><t>he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”;</t>
Romans 11-27 <t>“and this will be my <f>ⓕ</f>covenant with them </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>when I take away their sins.” </t>
Romans 11-28 <pb/>As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are <f>ⓗ</f>beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
Romans 11-29 For the gifts and <f>ⓘ</f>the calling of God are irrevocable.
Romans 11-30 For just as <f>ⓙ</f>you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,
Romans 11-31 so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now <f>[5]</f> receive mercy.
Romans 11-32 For God <f>ⓚ</f>has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.
Romans 11-33 <pb/>Oh, the depth of the riches and <f>ⓛ</f>wisdom and knowledge of God! <f>ⓜ</f>How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
Romans 11-34 <pb/><t>“For <f>ⓝ</f>who has known the mind of the Lord, </t><t>or <f>ⓞ</f>who has been his counselor?”</t>
Romans 11-35 <t>“Or <f>ⓟ</f>who has given a gift to him </t><t>that he might be repaid?” </t>
Romans 11-36 <pb/>For <f>ⓠ</f>from him and through him and to him are all things. <f>ⓡ</f>To him be glory forever. Amen.
