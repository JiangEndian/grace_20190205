Jeremiah 36-1 <pb/>In the <f>ⓐ</f>fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 36-2 “Take <f>ⓑ</f>a scroll and <f>ⓒ</f>write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and <f>ⓓ</f>Judah <f>ⓔ</f>and all the nations, <f>ⓕ</f>from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.
Jeremiah 36-3 <f>ⓖ</f> It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, <f>ⓗ</f>so that every one may turn from his evil way, and <f>ⓘ</f>that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
Jeremiah 36-4 <pb/>Then Jeremiah called <f>ⓙ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah, and <f>ⓚ</f>Baruch wrote on <f>ⓛ</f>a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him.
Jeremiah 36-5 And Jeremiah ordered <f>ⓜ</f>Baruch, saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“I am banned from going to the house of the LORD,
Jeremiah 36-6 so you are to go, and <f>ⓞ</f>on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the LORD's house you shall read the words of the LORD from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities.
Jeremiah 36-7 <f>ⓟ</f> It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, <f>ⓠ</f>and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people.”
Jeremiah 36-8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
Jeremiah 36-9 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, <f>ⓢ</f>in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem <f>ⓣ</f>proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
Jeremiah 36-10 Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in <f>ⓤ</f>the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD's house.
Jeremiah 36-11 <pb/>When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of <f>ⓥ</f>Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
Jeremiah 36-12 he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber, and <f>ⓦ</f>all the officials were sitting there: <f>ⓧ</f>Elishama the secretary, <f>ⓨ</f>Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, <f>ⓩ</f>Elnathan <f>ⓐ</f>the son of Achbor, <f>ⓑ</f>Gemariah the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials.
Jeremiah 36-13 And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.
Jeremiah 36-14 Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of <f>ⓓ</f>Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
Jeremiah 36-15 And they said to him, “Sit down and read it.” So Baruch read it to them.
Jeremiah 36-16 When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, <f>ⓔ</f>“We must report all these words to the king.”
Jeremiah 36-17 Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”
Jeremiah 36-18 Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, <f>ⓕ</f>while I wrote them with ink on the scroll.”
Jeremiah 36-19 Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.”
Jeremiah 36-20 <pb/>So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in <f>ⓖ</f>the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king.
Jeremiah 36-21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king.
Jeremiah 36-22 It was <f>ⓗ</f>the ninth month, and the king was sitting in <f>ⓘ</f>the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him.
Jeremiah 36-23 As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot.
Jeremiah 36-24 Yet <f>ⓙ</f>neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, <f>ⓚ</f>nor did they tear their garments.
Jeremiah 36-25 Even when <f>ⓛ</f>Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah <f>ⓜ</f>urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
Jeremiah 36-26 And the king commanded Jerahmeel the <f>ⓝ</f>king's son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and <f>ⓞ</f>Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize <f>ⓟ</f>Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.
Jeremiah 36-27 <pb/>Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 36-28 “Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
Jeremiah 36-29 And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, <f>ⓠ</f>“Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?”
Jeremiah 36-30 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: <f>ⓡ</f>He shall have none <f>ⓢ</f>to sit on the throne of David, <f>ⓣ</f>and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.
Jeremiah 36-31 <f>ⓤ</f> And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.’”
Jeremiah 36-32 <pb/>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to <f>ⓥ</f>Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who <f>ⓦ</f>wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
