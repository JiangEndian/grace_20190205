John 4-1 <pb/>Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and <f>ⓐ</f>baptizing more disciples than John
John 4-2 (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),
John 4-3 he left Judea and departed <f>ⓑ</f>again for Galilee.
John 4-4 <f>ⓒ</f> And he had to pass through Samaria.
John 4-5 So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field <f>ⓓ</f>that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
John 4-6 Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, <f>ⓔ</f>wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour. <f>[1]</f>
John 4-7 <pb/>A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Give me a drink.”</J>
John 4-8 (For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)
John 4-9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” (<f>ⓖ</f>For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
John 4-10 Jesus answered her, <J>“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you <f>ⓗ</f>living water.”</J>
John 4-11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?
John 4-12 <f>ⓘ</f> Are you greater than our father Jacob? <f>ⓙ</f>He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.”
John 4-13 Jesus said to her, <J>“Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,</J>
John 4-14 <J>but <f>ⓚ</f>whoever drinks of the water that I will give him <f>ⓛ</f>will never be thirsty again. <f>[2]</f> The water that I will give him will become <f>ⓜ</f>in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</J>
John 4-15 The woman said to him, “Sir, <f>ⓝ</f>give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”
John 4-16 <pb/>Jesus said to her, <J>“Go, <f>ⓞ</f>call your husband, and come here.”</J>
John 4-17 The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, <J>“You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’;</J>
John 4-18 <J>for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”</J>
John 4-19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that <f>ⓟ</f>you are <f>ⓠ</f>a prophet.
John 4-20 <f>ⓡ</f> Our fathers worshiped on <f>ⓢ</f>this mountain, but you say that <f>ⓣ</f>in Jerusalem is <f>ⓤ</f>the place where people ought to worship.”
John 4-21 Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“Woman, believe me, <f>ⓦ</f>the hour is coming when <f>ⓧ</f>neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</J>
John 4-22 <J><f>ⓨ</f> You worship what you do not know; <f>ⓩ</f>we worship what we know, for <f>ⓐ</f>salvation is <f>ⓑ</f>from the Jews.</J>
John 4-23 <J>But <f>ⓒ</f>the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father <f>ⓓ</f>in spirit and <f>ⓔ</f>truth, for the Father <f>ⓕ</f>is seeking such people to worship him.</J>
John 4-24 <J>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</J>
John 4-25 The woman said to him, “I know that <f>ⓖ</f>Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, <f>ⓗ</f>he will tell us all things.”
John 4-26 Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“I who speak to you am he.”</J>
John 4-27 <pb/>Just then <f>ⓙ</f>his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with her?”
John 4-28 So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people,
John 4-29 “Come, see a man <f>ⓚ</f>who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?”
John 4-30 They went out of the town and were coming to him.
John 4-31 <pb/>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, <f>ⓛ</f>“Rabbi, eat.”
John 4-32 But he said to them, <J>“I have food to eat that you do not know about.”</J>
John 4-33 So the disciples said to one another, <f>ⓜ</f>“Has anyone brought him something to eat?”
John 4-34 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“My food is <f>ⓞ</f>to do the will of him who sent me and <f>ⓟ</f>to accomplish his work.</J>
John 4-35 <J>Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that <f>ⓠ</f>the fields are white for harvest.</J>
John 4-36 <J>Already</J> <J>the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that <f>ⓡ</f>sower and <f>ⓢ</f>reaper <f>ⓣ</f>may rejoice together.</J>
John 4-37 <J>For here the saying holds true, <f>ⓤ</f>‘One sows and another reaps.’</J>
John 4-38 <J>I sent you to reap <f>ⓥ</f>that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, <f>ⓦ</f>and you have entered into their labor.”</J>
John 4-39 <pb/>Many Samaritans <f>ⓧ</f>from that town believed in him <f>ⓨ</f>because of <f>ⓩ</f>the woman's testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.”
John 4-40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
John 4-41 And many more believed <f>ⓐ</f>because of his word.
John 4-42 They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, <f>ⓑ</f>and we know that this is indeed <f>ⓒ</f>the Savior <f>ⓓ</f>of the world.”
John 4-43 <pb/>After <f>ⓔ</f>the two days he departed for Galilee.
John 4-44 (For Jesus himself had testified <f>ⓕ</f>that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.)
John 4-45 So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, <f>ⓖ</f>having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For <f>ⓗ</f>they too had gone to the feast.
John 4-46 <pb/>So he came again to <f>ⓘ</f>Cana in Galilee, <f>ⓙ</f>where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill.
John 4-47 When this man heard that Jesus <f>ⓚ</f>had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
John 4-48 So Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“Unless you <f>[3]</f> see signs and wonders you will not believe.”</J>
John 4-49 The official said to him, “Sir, come down <f>ⓜ</f>before my child dies.”
John 4-50 Jesus said to him, <J>“Go; your son will live.”</J> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way.
John 4-51 As he was going down, his servants <f>[4]</f> met him and told him that his son was recovering.
John 4-52 So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour <f>[5]</f> the fever left him.”
John 4-53 The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, <J>“Your son will live.”</J> And he himself believed, <f>ⓝ</f>and all his household.
John 4-54 <f>ⓞ</f> This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.
