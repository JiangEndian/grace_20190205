Revelation 18-1 <pb/>After this I saw <f>ⓐ</f>another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and <f>ⓑ</f>the earth was made bright with his glory.
Revelation 18-2 And he called out with a mighty voice, <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! </t><t>She has become <f>ⓓ</f>a dwelling place for demons, </t><t>a haunt <f>ⓔ</f>for every unclean spirit, </t><t>a haunt <f>ⓕ</f>for every unclean bird, </t><t>a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast.</t>
Revelation 18-3 <t>For all nations have drunk <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.” </t>
Revelation 18-4 <pb/>Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“Come out of her, my people, </t><t>lest you take part in her sins, </t><t>lest you share in her plagues;</t>
Revelation 18-5 <t>for <f>ⓚ</f>her sins are heaped high as heaven, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>God has remembered her iniquities.</t>
Revelation 18-6 <t><f>ⓜ</f> Pay her back as she herself has paid back others, </t><t>and repay her <f>ⓝ</f>double for her deeds; </t><t>mix a double portion for her <f>ⓞ</f>in the cup she mixed.</t>
Revelation 18-7 <t><f>ⓟ</f> As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, </t><t>so give her a like measure of torment and mourning, </t><t>since in her heart she says, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>‘I sit as a queen, </t><t>I am no widow, </t><t>and mourning I shall never see.’</t>
Revelation 18-8 <t>For this reason her plagues will come <f>ⓡ</f>in a single day, </t><t>death and mourning and famine, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>she will be burned up with fire; </t><t>for <f>ⓣ</f>mighty is the Lord God who has judged her.” </t>
Revelation 18-9 <pb/>And <f>ⓤ</f>the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, <f>ⓥ</f>will weep and wail over her <f>ⓦ</f>when they see the smoke of her burning.
Revelation 18-10 <f>ⓧ</f> They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, <pb/><t>“Alas! Alas! <f>ⓨ</f>You great city, </t><t>you mighty city, Babylon! </t><t>For <f>ⓩ</f>in a single hour your judgment has come.” </t>
Revelation 18-11 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore,
Revelation 18-12 cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble,
Revelation 18-13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls. <f>[2]</f>
Revelation 18-14 <pb/><t>“The fruit for which your soul longed </t><t>has gone from you, </t><t>and all your delicacies and your splendors </t><t>are lost to you, </t><t>never to be found again!” </t>
Revelation 18-15 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, <f>ⓒ</f>will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud,
Revelation 18-16 <pb/><t>“Alas, alas, for the great city </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>that was clothed in fine linen, </t><t>in purple and scarlet, </t><t>adorned with gold, </t><t>with jewels, and with pearls!</t>
Revelation 18-17 <t>For <f>ⓔ</f>in a single hour all this wealth <f>ⓕ</f>has been laid waste.” </t> <pb/>And <f>ⓖ</f>all shipmasters and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off
Revelation 18-18 and <f>ⓗ</f>cried out <f>ⓘ</f>as they saw the smoke of her burning, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“What city was like the great city?” </t>
Revelation 18-19 <pb/>And they threw <f>ⓚ</f>dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out, <pb/><t>“Alas, alas, for the great city </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>where all who had ships at sea </t><t>grew rich by her wealth! </t><t>For <f>ⓜ</f>in a single hour she has been laid waste.</t>
Revelation 18-20 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Rejoice over her, O heaven, </t><t>and you saints and <f>ⓞ</f>apostles and prophets, </t><t>for <f>ⓟ</f>God has given judgment for you against her!” </t>
Revelation 18-21 <pb/>Then <f>ⓠ</f>a mighty angel <f>ⓡ</f>took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, <pb/><t>“So will Babylon <f>ⓢ</f>the great city be thrown down with violence, </t><t>and will be found no more;</t>
Revelation 18-22 <t>and <f>ⓣ</f>the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters, </t><t>will be heard in you no more, </t><t>and a craftsman of any craft </t><t>will be found in you no more, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>the sound of the mill </t><t>will be heard in you no more,</t>
Revelation 18-23 <t>and the light of a lamp </t><t>will shine in you no more, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>the voice of bridegroom and bride </t><t>will be heard in you no more, </t><t>for <f>ⓦ</f>your merchants were the great ones of the earth, </t><t>and all nations were deceived <f>ⓧ</f>by your sorcery.</t>
Revelation 18-24 <t>And <f>ⓨ</f>in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, </t><t>and of <f>ⓩ</f>all who have been slain on earth.” </t>
