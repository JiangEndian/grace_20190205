Leviticus 10-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, <f>ⓑ</f>each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered <f>ⓒ</f>unauthorized <f>[1]</f> fire before the LORD, which he had not commanded them.
Leviticus 10-2 And fire <f>ⓓ</f>came out from before the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
Leviticus 10-3 Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Among <f>ⓔ</f>those who are near me <f>ⓕ</f>I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” <f>ⓖ</f>And Aaron held his peace.
Leviticus 10-4 <pb/>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of <f>ⓗ</f>Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp.”
Leviticus 10-5 So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
Leviticus 10-6 And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, <f>ⓘ</f>“Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and <f>ⓙ</f>wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the LORD has kindled.
Leviticus 10-7 <f>ⓚ</f> And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, <f>ⓛ</f>for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.
Leviticus 10-8 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,
Leviticus 10-9 <f>ⓜ</f> “Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
Leviticus 10-10 You are to <f>ⓝ</f>distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
Leviticus 10-11 and <f>ⓞ</f>you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the LORD has spoken to them by Moses.”
Leviticus 10-12 <pb/>Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: “Take the <f>ⓟ</f>grain offering that is left of the LORD's food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for <f>ⓠ</f>it is most holy.
Leviticus 10-13 You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due, from the LORD's food offerings, for <f>ⓡ</f>so I am commanded.
Leviticus 10-14 But the <f>ⓢ</f>breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons' due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel.
Leviticus 10-15 <f>ⓣ</f> The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be yours and your sons' with you as a due forever, as the LORD has commanded.”
Leviticus 10-16 <pb/>Now Moses diligently inquired about <f>ⓤ</f>the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,
Leviticus 10-17 <f>ⓥ</f> “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since <f>ⓦ</f>it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
Leviticus 10-18 Behold, <f>ⓧ</f>its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, <f>ⓨ</f>as I commanded.”
Leviticus 10-19 And Aaron said to Moses, “Behold, <f>ⓩ</f>today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, <f>ⓐ</f>would the LORD have approved?”
Leviticus 10-20 And when Moses heard that, he approved.
