2 Corinthians 13-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established <f>ⓑ</f>by the evidence of two or three witnesses.
2 Corinthians 13-2 <f>ⓒ</f> I warned <f>ⓓ</f>those who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that <f>ⓔ</f>if I come again I will not spare them —
2 Corinthians 13-3 since you seek proof that Christ <f>ⓕ</f>is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but <f>ⓖ</f>is powerful among you.
2 Corinthians 13-4 For <f>ⓗ</f>he was crucified in weakness, but <f>ⓘ</f>lives by the power of God. For <f>ⓙ</f>we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you <f>ⓚ</f>we will live with him by the power of God.
2 Corinthians 13-5 <pb/>Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. <f>ⓛ</f>Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that <f>ⓜ</f>Jesus Christ is in you? — unless indeed you fail to meet the test!
2 Corinthians 13-6 I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test.
2 Corinthians 13-7 But we pray to God that you may not do wrong — not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed.
2 Corinthians 13-8 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
2 Corinthians 13-9 For we are glad when <f>ⓝ</f>we are weak and you are strong. Your <f>ⓞ</f>restoration is what we pray for.
2 Corinthians 13-10 For this reason I write these things while I am away from you, that when I come <f>ⓟ</f>I may not have to be <f>ⓠ</f>severe in my use of <f>ⓡ</f>the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
2 Corinthians 13-11 <pb/>Finally, brothers, <f>[1]</f> rejoice. <f>ⓢ</f>Aim for restoration, comfort one another, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓣ</f>agree with one another, <f>ⓤ</f>live in peace; and the God of love and <f>ⓥ</f>peace will be with you.
2 Corinthians 13-12 <f>ⓦ</f> Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians 13-13 <f>ⓧ</f> All the saints greet you.
2 Corinthians 13-14 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and <f>ⓩ</f>the love of God and <f>ⓐ</f>the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
