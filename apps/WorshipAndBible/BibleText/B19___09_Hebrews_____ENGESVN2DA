Hebrews 9-1 <pb/>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and <f>ⓐ</f>an earthly place of holiness.
Hebrews 9-2 For <f>ⓑ</f>a tent <f>[1]</f> was prepared, the first section, in which were <f>ⓒ</f>the lampstand and <f>ⓓ</f>the table and <f>ⓔ</f>the bread of the Presence. <f>[2]</f> It is called the Holy Place.
Hebrews 9-3 Behind <f>ⓕ</f>the second curtain was a second section <f>[3]</f> called the Most Holy Place,
Hebrews 9-4 having the golden <f>ⓖ</f>altar of incense and <f>ⓗ</f>the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was <f>ⓘ</f>a golden urn holding the manna, and <f>ⓙ</f>Aaron's staff that budded, and <f>ⓚ</f>the tablets of the covenant.
Hebrews 9-5 Above it were <f>ⓛ</f>the cherubim of glory overshadowing <f>ⓜ</f>the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
Hebrews 9-6 <pb/>These preparations having thus been made, <f>ⓝ</f>the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties,
Hebrews 9-7 but into the second only <f>ⓞ</f>the high priest goes, and he but <f>ⓟ</f>once a year, and not without taking blood, <f>ⓠ</f>which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.
Hebrews 9-8 By this the Holy Spirit indicates that <f>ⓡ</f>the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing
Hebrews 9-9 (which is symbolic for the present age). <f>[4]</f> According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered <f>ⓢ</f>that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,
Hebrews 9-10 but deal only with <f>ⓣ</f>food and drink and <f>ⓤ</f>various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.
Hebrews 9-11 <pb/>But when Christ appeared as a high priest <f>ⓥ</f>of the good things that have come, <f>[5]</f> then through <f>ⓦ</f>the greater and more perfect tent (<f>ⓧ</f>not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)
Hebrews 9-12 he <f>ⓨ</f>entered <f>ⓩ</f>once for all into the holy places, not by means of <f>ⓐ</f>the blood of goats and calves but <f>ⓑ</f>by means of his own blood, <f>ⓒ</f>thus securing an eternal redemption.
Hebrews 9-13 For if <f>ⓓ</f>the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with <f>ⓔ</f>the ashes of a heifer, sanctify <f>[6]</f> for the purification of the flesh,
Hebrews 9-14 how much more will <f>ⓕ</f>the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit <f>ⓖ</f>offered himself without blemish to God, <f>ⓗ</f>purify our <f>[7]</f> conscience <f>ⓘ</f>from dead works <f>ⓙ</f>to serve the living God.
Hebrews 9-15 <pb/>Therefore he is <f>ⓚ</f>the mediator of a new covenant, so that <f>ⓛ</f>those who are called may <f>ⓜ</f>receive the promised eternal inheritance, <f>ⓝ</f>since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. <f>[8]</f>
Hebrews 9-16 For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.
Hebrews 9-17 For <f>ⓞ</f>a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.
Hebrews 9-18 Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated <f>ⓟ</f>without blood.
Hebrews 9-19 For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took <f>ⓠ</f>the blood of calves and goats, <f>ⓡ</f>with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
Hebrews 9-20 saying, <f>ⓢ</f>“This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.”
Hebrews 9-21 And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both <f>ⓣ</f>the tent and all the vessels used in worship.
Hebrews 9-22 Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and <f>ⓤ</f>without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
Hebrews 9-23 <pb/>Thus it was necessary for <f>ⓥ</f>the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews 9-24 For Christ has entered, not into holy places <f>ⓦ</f>made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God <f>ⓧ</f>on our behalf.
Hebrews 9-25 Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as <f>ⓨ</f>the high priest enters <f>ⓩ</f>the holy places every year with blood not his own,
Hebrews 9-26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, <f>ⓐ</f>he has appeared <f>ⓑ</f>once for all <f>ⓒ</f>at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews 9-27 And just as <f>ⓓ</f>it is appointed for man to die once, and <f>ⓔ</f>after that comes judgment,
Hebrews 9-28 so Christ, having been offered once <f>ⓕ</f>to bear the sins of <f>ⓖ</f>many, will appear <f>ⓗ</f>a second time, <f>ⓘ</f>not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly <f>ⓙ</f>waiting for him.
