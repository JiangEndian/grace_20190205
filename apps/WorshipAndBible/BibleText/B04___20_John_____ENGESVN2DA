John 20-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that <f>ⓑ</f>the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
John 20-2 So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, <f>ⓒ</f>the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and <f>ⓓ</f>we do not know where they have laid him.”
John 20-3 <f>ⓔ</f> So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.
John 20-4 Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
John 20-5 And stooping to look in, he saw <f>ⓕ</f>the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.
John 20-6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there,
John 20-7 and <f>ⓖ</f>the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' <f>[1]</f> head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself.
John 20-8 Then the other disciple, <f>ⓗ</f>who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;
John 20-9 for as yet <f>ⓘ</f>they did not understand the Scripture, <f>ⓙ</f>that he must rise from the dead.
John 20-10 Then the disciples went back to their homes.
John 20-11 <pb/>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.
John 20-12 And <f>ⓚ</f>she saw <f>ⓛ</f>two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet.
John 20-13 They said to her, <f>ⓜ</f>“Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, <f>ⓝ</f>“They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”
John 20-14 Having said this, she turned around and <f>ⓞ</f>saw Jesus standing, <f>ⓟ</f>but she did not know that it was Jesus.
John 20-15 Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“Woman, why are you weeping? <f>ⓡ</f>Whom are you seeking?”</J> Supposing him to be <f>ⓢ</f>the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
John 20-16 Jesus said to her, <J>“Mary.”</J> She turned and said to him in Aramaic, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓣ</f>“Rabboni!” (which means Teacher).
John 20-17 Jesus said to her, <J>“Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to <f>ⓤ</f>my brothers and say to them, <f>ⓥ</f>‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to <f>ⓦ</f>my God and your God.’”</J>
John 20-18 Mary Magdalene <f>ⓧ</f>went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord” — and that he had said these things to her.
John 20-19 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> On the evening <f>ⓩ</f>of that day, the first day of the week, <f>ⓐ</f>the doors being locked where the disciples were <f>ⓑ</f>for fear of the Jews, <f>[3]</f> Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“Peace be with you.”</J>
John 20-20 When he had said this, <f>ⓓ</f>he showed them his hands and his side. Then <f>ⓔ</f>the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
John 20-21 Jesus said to them again, <J>“Peace be with you. As <f>ⓕ</f>the Father has sent me, <f>ⓖ</f>even so I am sending you.”</J>
John 20-22 And when he had said this, he <f>ⓗ</f>breathed on them and said to them, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“Receive the Holy Spirit.</J>
John 20-23 <J><f>ⓙ</f> If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.”</J>
John 20-24 <pb/>Now <f>ⓚ</f>Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, <f>[4]</f> was not with them when Jesus came.
John 20-25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, <f>ⓛ</f>“Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.”
John 20-26 <pb/>Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. <f>ⓜ</f>Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“Peace be with you.”</J>
John 20-27 Then he said to Thomas, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.”</J>
John 20-28 Thomas answered him, <f>ⓟ</f>“My Lord and my God!”
John 20-29 Jesus said to him, <J>“Have you believed because you have seen me? <f>ⓠ</f>Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”</J>
John 20-30 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Now Jesus did many other signs <f>ⓢ</f>in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;
John 20-31 <f>ⓣ</f> but these are written so that you may <f>ⓤ</f>believe that Jesus is the Christ, <f>ⓥ</f>the Son of God, and that by believing <f>ⓦ</f>you may have life <f>ⓧ</f>in his name.
