Luke 3-1 <pb/>In the fifteenth year of the reign of <f>ⓐ</f>Tiberius Caesar, <f>ⓑ</f>Pontius Pilate <f>ⓒ</f>being governor of Judea, and <f>ⓓ</f>Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
Luke 3-2 during <f>ⓔ</f>the high priesthood of Annas and <f>ⓕ</f>Caiaphas, <f>ⓖ</f>the word of God came to <f>ⓗ</f>John the son of Zechariah in <f>ⓘ</f>the wilderness.
Luke 3-3 And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming <f>ⓙ</f>a baptism of repentance <f>ⓚ</f>for the forgiveness of sins.
Luke 3-4 As it is written in <f>ⓛ</f>the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness: </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>‘Prepare the way of the Lord, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>make his paths straight.</t>
Luke 3-5 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Every valley shall be filled, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>and every mountain and hill shall be made low, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and the crooked shall become straight, </t><t>and the rough places shall become level ways,</t>
Luke 3-6 <t><f>ⓡ</f> and all flesh shall see <f>ⓢ</f>the salvation of God.’” </t>
Luke 3-7 <pb/>He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, <f>ⓣ</f>“You brood of <f>ⓤ</f>vipers! Who warned you to flee from <f>ⓥ</f>the wrath to come?
Luke 3-8 Bear fruits <f>ⓦ</f>in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, <f>ⓧ</f>‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from <f>ⓨ</f>these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
Luke 3-9 Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. <f>ⓩ</f>Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
Luke 3-10 <pb/>And the crowds asked him, <f>ⓐ</f>“What then shall we do?”
Luke 3-11 And he answered them, <f>ⓑ</f>“Whoever has two tunics <f>[2]</f> is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.”
Luke 3-12 <f>ⓒ</f> Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, “Teacher, <f>ⓓ</f>what shall we do?”
Luke 3-13 And he said to them, <f>ⓔ</f>“Collect no more than you are authorized to do.”
Luke 3-14 Soldiers also asked him, “And we, <f>ⓕ</f>what shall we do?” And he said to them, <f>ⓖ</f>“Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your <f>ⓗ</f>wages.”
Luke 3-15 <pb/>As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, <f>ⓘ</f>whether he might be <f>ⓙ</f>the Christ,
Luke 3-16 <f>ⓚ</f> John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but <f>ⓛ</f>he who is mightier than I is coming, <f>ⓜ</f>the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you <f>ⓝ</f>with the Holy Spirit and <f>ⓞ</f>fire.
Luke 3-17 His <f>ⓟ</f>winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to <f>ⓠ</f>gather the wheat into his barn, <f>ⓡ</f>but the chaff he will burn with <f>ⓢ</f>unquenchable fire.”
Luke 3-18 <pb/>So <f>ⓣ</f>with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.
Luke 3-19 But <f>ⓤ</f>Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,
Luke 3-20 added this to them all, that <f>ⓥ</f>he locked up John in prison.
Luke 3-21 <pb/>Now when all the people were baptized, and when <f>ⓦ</f>Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, <f>ⓧ</f>the heavens were opened,
Luke 3-22 and <f>ⓨ</f>the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and <f>ⓩ</f>a voice came from heaven, <f>ⓐ</f>“You are my beloved Son; <f>[3]</f> with you I am well pleased.” <f>[4]</f>
