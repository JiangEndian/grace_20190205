Matthew 21-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to <f>ⓑ</f>the Mount of Olives, then Jesus <f>ⓒ</f>sent two disciples,
Matthew 21-2 saying to them, <J>“Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.</J>
Matthew 21-3 <J>If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.”</J>
Matthew 21-4 This took place <f>ⓓ</f>to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,
Matthew 21-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “Say to the daughter of Zion, </t><t>‘Behold, your king is coming to you, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>humble, and mounted on a donkey, </t><t>on a colt, <f>[1]</f> the foal of a beast of burden.’” </t>
Matthew 21-6 <pb/>The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
Matthew 21-7 They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them.
Matthew 21-8 Most of the crowd <f>ⓖ</f>spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Matthew 21-9 And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, <f>ⓗ</f>“Hosanna to <f>ⓘ</f>the Son of David! <f>ⓙ</f>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna <f>ⓚ</f>in the highest!”
Matthew 21-10 And <f>ⓛ</f>when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”
Matthew 21-11 And the crowds said, “This is <f>ⓜ</f>the prophet Jesus, <f>ⓝ</f>from Nazareth of Galilee.”
Matthew 21-12 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> And Jesus entered the temple <f>[2]</f> and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of <f>ⓟ</f>the money-changers and the seats of those who sold <f>ⓠ</f>pigeons.
Matthew 21-13 He said to them, <J>“It is written, <f>ⓡ</f>‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but <f>ⓢ</f>you make it a den of robbers.”</J>
Matthew 21-14 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
Matthew 21-15 <f>ⓤ</f> But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, <f>ⓥ</f>“Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant,
Matthew 21-16 and they said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” And Jesus said to them, <J>“Yes; <f>ⓦ</f>have you never read,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓧ</f>“‘Out of the mouth of <f>ⓨ</f>infants and nursing babies</J> </t><t><J>you have prepared praise’?”</J> </t>
Matthew 21-17 <pb/>And <f>ⓩ</f>leaving them, he <f>ⓐ</f>went out of the city to <f>ⓑ</f>Bethany and lodged there.
Matthew 21-18 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> In the morning, as he was returning to the city, <f>ⓓ</f>he became hungry.
Matthew 21-19 <f>ⓔ</f> And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, <J>“May no fruit ever come from you again!”</J> And the fig tree withered at once.
Matthew 21-20 <pb/>When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”
Matthew 21-21 And Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓖ</f>if you have faith and <f>ⓗ</f>do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, <f>ⓘ</f>‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.</J>
Matthew 21-22 <J>And <f>ⓙ</f>whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, <f>ⓚ</f>if you have faith.”</J>
Matthew 21-23 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him <f>ⓜ</f>as he was teaching, and said, <f>ⓝ</f>“By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”
Matthew 21-24 Jesus answered them, <J>“I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</J>
Matthew 21-25 <J>The baptism of John, <f>ⓞ</f>from where did it come? <f>ⓟ</f>From heaven or from man?”</J> And they discussed it among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Why then did you not believe him?’
Matthew 21-26 But if we say, ‘From man,’ <f>ⓡ</f>we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was <f>ⓢ</f>a prophet.”
Matthew 21-27 So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, <J>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</J>
Matthew 21-28 <pb/><J><f>ⓣ</f> “What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in <f>ⓤ</f>the vineyard today.’</J>
Matthew 21-29 <J>And he answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he <f>ⓥ</f>changed his mind and went.</J>
Matthew 21-30 <J>And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but did not go.</J>
Matthew 21-31 <J>Which of the two did the will of his father?”</J> They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, <J>“Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓦ</f>the tax collectors and <f>ⓧ</f>the prostitutes go into <f>ⓨ</f>the kingdom of God before you.</J>
Matthew 21-32 <J>For John came to you <f>ⓩ</f>in the way of righteousness, and <f>ⓐ</f>you did not believe him, but <f>ⓑ</f>the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward <f>ⓒ</f>change your minds and believe him.</J>
Matthew 21-33 <pb/><J><f>ⓓ</f> “Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted <f>ⓔ</f>a vineyard <f>ⓕ</f>and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and <f>ⓖ</f>leased it to tenants, and <f>ⓗ</f>went into another country.</J>
Matthew 21-34 <J>When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants <f>[3]</f> to the tenants <f>ⓘ</f>to get his fruit.</J>
Matthew 21-35 <J><f>ⓙ</f> And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and <f>ⓚ</f>stoned another.</J>
Matthew 21-36 <J><f>ⓛ</f> Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them.</J>
Matthew 21-37 <J>Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</J>
Matthew 21-38 <J>But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, <f>ⓜ</f>‘This is the heir. Come, <f>ⓝ</f>let us kill him and have his inheritance.’</J>
Matthew 21-39 <J>And they took him and <f>ⓞ</f>threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</J>
Matthew 21-40 <J><f>ⓟ</f> When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”</J>
Matthew 21-41 They said to him, <f>ⓠ</f>“He will put those wretches to a miserable death and <f>ⓡ</f>let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.”
Matthew 21-42 <pb/>Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“Have you never read in the Scriptures:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓣ</f>“‘The stone that the builders rejected</J> </t><t><J>has become the cornerstone; <f>[4]</f></J> </t><t><J>this was the Lord's doing,</J> </t><t><J>and it is marvelous in our eyes’?</J> </t>
Matthew 21-43 <pb/><J>Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God <f>ⓤ</f>will be taken away from you and given to a people <f>ⓥ</f>producing its fruits.</J>
Matthew 21-44 <J>And <f>ⓦ</f>the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and <f>ⓧ</f>when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.” <f>[5]</f></J>
Matthew 21-45 <pb/>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them.
Matthew 21-46 And <f>ⓨ</f>although they were seeking to arrest him, <f>ⓩ</f>they feared the crowds, because they held him to be <f>ⓐ</f>a prophet.
