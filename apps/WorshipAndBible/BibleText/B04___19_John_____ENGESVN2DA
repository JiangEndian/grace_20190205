John 19-1 <pb/>Then Pilate took Jesus and <f>ⓐ</f>flogged him.
John 19-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe.
John 19-3 They came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him with their hands.
John 19-4 Pilate went out again and said to them, “See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that <f>ⓒ</f>I find no guilt in him.”
John 19-5 So Jesus came out, wearing <f>ⓓ</f>the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, <f>ⓔ</f>“Behold the man!”
John 19-6 When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, <f>ⓕ</f>“Take him yourselves and crucify him, for <f>ⓖ</f>I find no guilt in him.”
John 19-7 The Jews <f>[1]</f> answered him, “We have a law, and <f>ⓗ</f>according to that law he ought to die because <f>ⓘ</f>he has made himself the Son of God.”
John 19-8 When Pilate heard this statement, <f>ⓙ</f>he was even more afraid.
John 19-9 <f>ⓚ</f> He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, <f>ⓛ</f>“Where are you from?” But <f>ⓜ</f>Jesus gave him no answer.
John 19-10 So Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?”
John 19-11 Jesus answered him, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore <f>ⓞ</f>he who delivered me over to you <f>ⓟ</f>has the greater sin.”</J>
John 19-12 <pb/>From then on <f>ⓠ</f>Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. <f>ⓡ</f>Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.”
John 19-13 So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on <f>ⓢ</f>the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic <f>[2]</f> Gabbatha.
John 19-14 Now it was <f>ⓣ</f>the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. <f>[3]</f> He said to the Jews, <f>ⓤ</f>“Behold your King!”
John 19-15 They cried out, <f>ⓥ</f>“Away with him, away with him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”
John 19-16 <f>ⓦ</f> So he <f>ⓧ</f>delivered him over to them to be crucified. <pb/><e>The Crucifixion</e> </pb> <pb/>So they took Jesus,
John 19-17 and <f>ⓨ</f>he went out, <f>ⓩ</f>bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha.
John 19-18 <f>ⓐ</f> There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.
John 19-19 Pilate <f>ⓑ</f>also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”
John 19-20 Many of the Jews read this inscription, for <f>ⓒ</f>the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.
John 19-21 So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’”
John 19-22 Pilate answered, <f>ⓓ</f>“What I have written I have written.”
John 19-23 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. <f>[4]</f> But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom,
John 19-24 so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” <f>ⓕ</f>This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“They divided my garments among them, </t><t>and for my clothing they cast lots.” </t> <pb/>So the soldiers did these things,
John 19-25 <f>ⓗ</f> but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John 19-26 When Jesus saw his mother and <f>ⓘ</f>the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“Woman, behold, your son!”</J>
John 19-27 Then he said to the disciple, <J>“Behold, your mother!”</J> And from that hour the disciple took her to <f>ⓚ</f>his own home.
John 19-28 <pb/>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now <f>ⓛ</f>finished, said (<f>ⓜ</f>to fulfill the Scripture), <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“I thirst.”</J>
John 19-29 A jar full of sour wine stood there, <f>ⓞ</f>so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.
John 19-30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“It is finished,”</J> and he bowed his head and <f>ⓠ</f>gave up his spirit.
John 19-31 <pb/>Since it was <f>ⓡ</f>the day of Preparation, and <f>ⓢ</f>so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was <f>ⓣ</f>a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.
John 19-32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other <f>ⓤ</f>who had been crucified with him.
John 19-33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
John 19-34 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out <f>ⓥ</f>blood and water.
John 19-35 <f>ⓦ</f> He who saw it has borne witness — <f>ⓧ</f>his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth — <f>ⓨ</f>that you also may believe.
John 19-36 <f>ⓩ</f> For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: <f>ⓐ</f>“Not one of his bones <f>ⓑ</f>will be broken.”
John 19-37 And again another Scripture says, <f>ⓒ</f>“They will look on him whom they have pierced.”
John 19-38 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly <f>ⓔ</f>for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.
John 19-39 <f>ⓕ</f> Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus <f>[5]</f> by night, came <f>ⓖ</f>bringing a mixture of <f>ⓗ</f>myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds <f>[6]</f> in weight.
John 19-40 So they took the body of Jesus and <f>ⓘ</f>bound it in <f>ⓙ</f>linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
John 19-41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a <f>ⓚ</f>garden, and <f>ⓛ</f>in the garden a new tomb <f>ⓜ</f>in which no one had yet been laid.
John 19-42 So because of the Jewish <f>ⓝ</f>day of Preparation, <f>ⓞ</f>since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.
