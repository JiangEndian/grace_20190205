Zechariah 4-1 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>the angel who talked with me came again <f>ⓑ</f>and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep.
Zechariah 4-2 And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, <f>ⓒ</f>a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and <f>ⓓ</f>seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.
Zechariah 4-3 And there are <f>ⓔ</f>two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
Zechariah 4-4 And I said to <f>ⓕ</f>the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
Zechariah 4-5 Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, <f>ⓖ</f>“Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”
Zechariah 4-6 Then he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to <f>ⓗ</f>Zerubbabel: <f>ⓘ</f>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah 4-7 Who are you, <f>ⓙ</f>O great mountain? Before <f>ⓚ</f>Zerubbabel <f>ⓛ</f>you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward <f>ⓜ</f>the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”
Zechariah 4-8 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Zechariah 4-9 <f>ⓝ</f> “The hands of <f>ⓞ</f>Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also <f>ⓟ</f>complete it. <f>ⓠ</f>Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
Zechariah 4-10 <f>ⓡ</f> For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see <f>ⓢ</f>the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. <pb/><f>ⓣ</f>“These seven <f>ⓤ</f>are the eyes of the LORD, <f>ⓥ</f>which range through the whole earth.”
Zechariah 4-11 Then I said to him, “What are these <f>ⓦ</f>two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”
Zechariah 4-12 And a second time I answered and said to him, “What are these <f>ⓧ</f>two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil <f>[1]</f> is poured out?”
Zechariah 4-13 He said to me, <f>ⓨ</f>“Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”
Zechariah 4-14 Then he said, <f>ⓩ</f>“These are the two anointed ones <f>[2]</f> who stand by <f>ⓐ</f>the Lord of the whole earth.”
