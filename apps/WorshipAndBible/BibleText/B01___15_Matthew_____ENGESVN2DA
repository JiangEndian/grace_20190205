Matthew 15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then Pharisees and <f>ⓑ</f>scribes came to Jesus <f>ⓒ</f>from Jerusalem and said,
Matthew 15-2 <f>ⓓ</f> “Why do your disciples break <f>ⓔ</f>the tradition of the elders? <f>ⓕ</f>For they do not wash their hands when they eat.”
Matthew 15-3 He answered them, <J>“And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</J>
Matthew 15-4 <J>For God commanded, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.’</J>
Matthew 15-5 <J>But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or his mother, “What you would have gained from me is given to God,” <f>[1]</f></J>
Matthew 15-6 <J>he need not honor his father.’</J> <J>So for the sake of your tradition you have <f>ⓘ</f>made void the word <f>[2]</f> of God.</J>
Matthew 15-7 <J><f>ⓙ</f> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said:</J>
Matthew 15-8 <pb/><t><J><f>ⓚ</f> “‘This people honors me with their lips,</J> </t><t><J>but their heart is far from me;</J></t>
Matthew 15-9 <t><J>in vain do they worship me,</J> </t><t><J>teaching as <f>ⓛ</f>doctrines the commandments of men.’”</J> </t>
Matthew 15-10 <pb/>And he called the people to him and said to them, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“Hear and understand:</J>
Matthew 15-11 <J><f>ⓝ</f> it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.”</J>
Matthew 15-12 Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were <f>ⓞ</f>offended when they heard this saying?”
Matthew 15-13 He answered, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted <f>ⓠ</f>will be rooted up.</J>
Matthew 15-14 <J>Let them alone; <f>ⓡ</f>they are blind guides. <f>[3]</f> And <f>ⓢ</f>if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</J>
Matthew 15-15 But Peter said to him, <f>ⓣ</f>“Explain the parable to us.”
Matthew 15-16 And he said, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“Are you also still without understanding?</J>
Matthew 15-17 <J>Do you not see that <f>ⓥ</f>whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? <f>[4]</f></J>
Matthew 15-18 <J>But <f>ⓦ</f>what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.</J>
Matthew 15-19 <J>For out of the heart come <f>ⓧ</f>evil thoughts, <f>ⓨ</f>murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, <f>ⓩ</f>slander.</J>
Matthew 15-20 <J><f>ⓐ</f> These are what defile a person. But <f>ⓑ</f>to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone.”</J>
Matthew 15-21 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew 15-22 And behold, <f>ⓓ</f>a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, <f>ⓔ</f>“Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.”
Matthew 15-23 But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, <f>ⓕ</f>“Send her away, for she is crying out after us.”
Matthew 15-24 He answered, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</J>
Matthew 15-25 But she came and <f>ⓗ</f>knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.”
Matthew 15-26 And he answered, <J>“It is not right to take the children's bread and <f>ⓘ</f>throw it to the dogs.”</J>
Matthew 15-27 She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat <f>ⓙ</f>the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.”
Matthew 15-28 Then Jesus answered her, <J>“O woman, <f>ⓚ</f>great is your faith! <f>ⓛ</f>Be it done for you as you desire.”</J> <f>ⓜ</f>And her daughter was <f>ⓝ</f>healed instantly. <f>[5]</f>
Matthew 15-29 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Jesus went on from there and walked <f>ⓟ</f>beside the Sea of Galilee. And he <f>ⓠ</f>went up on the mountain and sat down there.
Matthew 15-30 And great crowds came to him, bringing with them <f>ⓡ</f>the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them,
Matthew 15-31 <f>ⓢ</f> so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, <f>ⓣ</f>the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And <f>ⓤ</f>they glorified <f>ⓥ</f>the God of Israel.
Matthew 15-32 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, <J> <f>ⓧ</f>“I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”</J>
Matthew 15-33 And the disciples said to him, “Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?”
Matthew 15-34 And Jesus said to them, <J>“How many loaves do you have?”</J> They said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Seven, and a few small fish.”
Matthew 15-35 And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground,
Matthew 15-36 he took the seven loaves and the fish, and <f>ⓩ</f>having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
Matthew 15-37 And <f>ⓐ</f>they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
Matthew 15-38 Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew 15-39 And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of <f>ⓑ</f>Magadan.
