Exodus 34-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓐ</f>“Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, <f>ⓑ</f>and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, <f>ⓒ</f>which you broke.
Exodus 34-2 Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me <f>ⓓ</f>on the top of the mountain.
Exodus 34-3 No <f>ⓔ</f>one shall come up with you, and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain. Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain.”
Exodus 34-4 So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone.
Exodus 34-5 The LORD <f>ⓕ</f>descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and <f>ⓖ</f>proclaimed the name of the LORD.
Exodus 34-6 The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, <f>ⓗ</f>“The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and <f>ⓘ</f>gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast <f>ⓙ</f>love and faithfulness,
Exodus 34-7 <f>ⓚ</f> keeping steadfast love for thousands, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but <f>ⓜ</f>who will by no means clear the guilty, <f>ⓝ</f>visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.”
Exodus 34-8 And Moses quickly <f>ⓞ</f>bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.
Exodus 34-9 And he said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please <f>ⓟ</f>let the Lord go in the midst of us, for <f>ⓠ</f>it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for <f>ⓡ</f>your inheritance.”
Exodus 34-10 <pb/>And he said, “Behold, <f>ⓢ</f>I am making a covenant. Before all your people <f>ⓣ</f>I will do marvels, such as have not been created in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people among whom you are shall see the work of the LORD, for it is an <f>ⓤ</f>awesome thing that I will do with you.
Exodus 34-11 <pb/>“Observe what I command you this day. Behold, <f>ⓥ</f>I will drive out before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

Exodus 34-14 (for <f>ⓑ</f>you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God),
Exodus 34-15 <f>ⓒ</f> lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and when they <f>ⓓ</f>whore after their gods and sacrifice to their gods and <f>ⓔ</f>you are invited, you eat of his sacrifice,
Exodus 34-16 and you take of <f>ⓕ</f>their daughters for your sons, and their daughters <f>ⓖ</f>whore after their gods and make your sons whore after their gods.
Exodus 34-17 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> “You shall not make for yourself any gods of cast metal.

Exodus 34-20 The <f>ⓛ</f>firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And <f>ⓜ</f>none shall appear before me empty-handed.

Exodus 34-24 For I will <f>ⓠ</f>cast out nations before you and <f>ⓡ</f>enlarge your borders; <f>ⓢ</f>no one shall covet your land, when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times in the year.
Exodus 34-25 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> “You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, <f>ⓤ</f>or let the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover remain until the morning.
Exodus 34-26 <f>ⓥ</f> The best of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. <f>ⓦ</f>You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.”
Exodus 34-27 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “Write these words, for in accordance with these words <f>ⓧ</f>I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
Exodus 34-28 <f>ⓨ</f> So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights. He neither ate bread nor drank water. And he <f>ⓩ</f>wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments. <f>[3]</f>
Exodus 34-29 <pb/>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with <f>ⓐ</f>the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face <f>ⓑ</f>shone because he had been talking with God. <f>[4]</f>
Exodus 34-30 Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face <f>ⓒ</f>shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
Exodus 34-31 But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them.
Exodus 34-32 Afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he <f>ⓓ</f>commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.
Exodus 34-33 And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a <f>ⓔ</f>veil over his face.
Exodus 34-34 <pb/>Whenever Moses <f>ⓕ</f>went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would remove the veil, until he came out. And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was commanded,
Exodus 34-35 the people of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face was <f>ⓖ</f>shining. And Moses would put the veil over his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
