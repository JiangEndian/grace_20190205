Isaiah 25-5 <t><f>ⓘ</f> like heat in a dry place. </t><t>You subdue the noise of the foreigners; </t><t>as heat by the shade of a cloud, </t><t>so the song of the ruthless is put down. </t>

Isaiah 25-11 <t><f>ⓥ</f> And he will spread out his hands in the midst of it </t><t>as a swimmer spreads his hands out to swim, </t><t>but the LORD <f>ⓦ</f>will lay low his pompous pride together with the skill <f>[2]</f> of his hands.</t>
Isaiah 25-12 <t>And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down, </t><t>lay low, and cast to the ground, to the dust. </t>
