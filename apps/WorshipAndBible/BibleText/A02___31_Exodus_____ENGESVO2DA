Exodus 31-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses,
Exodus 31-2 “See, I have called by name <f>ⓐ</f>Bezalel the son of Uri, son of <f>ⓑ</f>Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
Exodus 31-3 and I have <f>ⓒ</f>filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship,
Exodus 31-4 to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze,
Exodus 31-5 in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, to work in every craft.
Exodus 31-6 And behold, I have appointed with him <f>ⓓ</f>Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And I have given to all able men <f>ⓔ</f>ability, that they may make all that I have commanded you:
Exodus 31-7 <f>ⓕ</f> the tent of meeting, and <f>ⓖ</f>the ark of the testimony, and <f>ⓗ</f>the mercy seat that is on it, and all the furnishings of the tent,
Exodus 31-8 <f>ⓘ</f> the table and its utensils, and <f>ⓙ</f>the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and <f>ⓚ</f>the altar of incense,
Exodus 31-9 and <f>ⓛ</f>the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and <f>ⓜ</f>the basin and its stand,
Exodus 31-10 and <f>ⓝ</f>the finely worked garments, <f>[1]</f> the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, for their service as priests,
Exodus 31-11 and <f>ⓞ</f>the anointing oil and the fragrant <f>ⓟ</f>incense for the Holy Place. According to all that I have commanded you, they shall do.”
Exodus 31-12 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses,
Exodus 31-13 “You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, ‘Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the LORD, sanctify you.
Exodus 31-14 You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. <f>ⓠ</f>Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Exodus 31-15 <f>ⓡ</f> Six days shall work be done, but <f>ⓢ</f>the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. <f>ⓣ</f>Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.
Exodus 31-16 Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a covenant forever.
Exodus 31-17 <f>ⓤ</f> It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that <f>ⓥ</f>in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and <f>ⓦ</f>on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’”
Exodus 31-18 <pb/>And he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the <f>ⓧ</f>two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with <f>ⓨ</f>the finger of God.
