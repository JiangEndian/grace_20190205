1 Thessalonians 1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>Silvanus, and Timothy, <pb/>To the church of the <f>ⓑ</f>Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: <pb/><f>ⓒ</f>Grace to you and peace.
1 Thessalonians 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>mentioning you in our prayers,
1 Thessalonians 1-3 remembering before <f>ⓕ</f>our God and Father <f>ⓖ</f>your work of faith and labor of <f>ⓗ</f>love and <f>ⓘ</f>steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians 1-4 For we know, <f>ⓙ</f>brothers <f>[2]</f> loved by God, <f>ⓚ</f>that he has chosen you,
1 Thessalonians 1-5 because <f>ⓛ</f>our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and <f>ⓜ</f>in the Holy Spirit and with full <f>ⓝ</f>conviction. You know <f>ⓞ</f>what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.
1 Thessalonians 1-6 And <f>ⓟ</f>you became imitators of us <f>ⓠ</f>and of the Lord, for <f>ⓡ</f>you received the word in much affliction, <f>ⓢ</f>with the <f>ⓣ</f>joy of the Holy Spirit,
1 Thessalonians 1-7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
1 Thessalonians 1-8 For not only has the word of the Lord <f>ⓤ</f>sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth <f>ⓥ</f>everywhere, so that we need not say anything.
1 Thessalonians 1-9 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of <f>ⓦ</f>reception we had among you, and how <f>ⓧ</f>you turned to God <f>ⓨ</f>from idols to serve the living and <f>ⓩ</f>true God,
1 Thessalonians 1-10 and <f>ⓐ</f>to wait for his Son <f>ⓑ</f>from heaven, <f>ⓒ</f>whom he raised from the dead, Jesus <f>ⓓ</f>who delivers us from <f>ⓔ</f>the wrath to come.
