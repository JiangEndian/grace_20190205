Ephesians 3-1 <pb/>For this reason I, Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>a prisoner of Christ Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>on behalf of you Gentiles —
Ephesians 3-2 assuming that you have heard of <f>ⓒ</f>the stewardship of <f>ⓓ</f>God's grace that was given to me for you,
Ephesians 3-3 <f>ⓔ</f> how the mystery was made known to me <f>ⓕ</f>by revelation, <f>ⓖ</f>as I have written briefly.
Ephesians 3-4 <f>ⓗ</f> When you read this, you can perceive my insight into <f>ⓘ</f>the mystery of Christ,
Ephesians 3-5 which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
Ephesians 3-6 This mystery is <f>[1]</f> that the Gentiles are <f>ⓙ</f>fellow heirs, <f>ⓚ</f>members of the same body, and <f>ⓛ</f>partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
Ephesians 3-7 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Of this gospel I was made <f>ⓝ</f>a minister according to the gift of <f>ⓞ</f>God's grace, which was given me <f>ⓟ</f>by the working of his power.
Ephesians 3-8 To me, <f>ⓠ</f>though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, <f>ⓡ</f>to preach to the Gentiles the <f>ⓢ</f>unsearchable <f>ⓣ</f>riches of Christ,
Ephesians 3-9 and <f>ⓤ</f>to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery <f>ⓥ</f>hidden for ages in <f>[2]</f> God, <f>ⓦ</f>who created all things,
Ephesians 3-10 so that through the church the manifold <f>ⓧ</f>wisdom of God <f>ⓨ</f>might now be made known to <f>ⓩ</f>the rulers and authorities <f>ⓐ</f>in the heavenly places.
Ephesians 3-11 This was <f>ⓑ</f>according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord,
Ephesians 3-12 in whom we have <f>ⓒ</f>boldness and <f>ⓓ</f>access with <f>ⓔ</f>confidence through our <f>ⓕ</f>faith in him.
Ephesians 3-13 So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering <f>ⓖ</f>for you, <f>ⓗ</f>which is your glory.
Ephesians 3-14 <pb/>For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
Ephesians 3-15 from whom <f>ⓘ</f>every family <f>[3]</f> in heaven and on earth is named,
Ephesians 3-16 that according to <f>ⓙ</f>the riches of his glory <f>ⓚ</f>he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit <f>ⓛ</f>in your inner being,
Ephesians 3-17 <f>ⓜ</f> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith — that you, being <f>ⓝ</f>rooted and <f>ⓞ</f>grounded in love,
Ephesians 3-18 may have strength to <f>ⓟ</f>comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and <f>ⓠ</f>height and depth,
Ephesians 3-19 and to know the love of Christ <f>ⓡ</f>that surpasses knowledge, that <f>ⓢ</f>you may be filled with all <f>ⓣ</f>the fullness of God.
Ephesians 3-20 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Now to <f>ⓥ</f>him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, <f>ⓦ</f>according to the power at work within us,
Ephesians 3-21 <f>ⓧ</f> to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
