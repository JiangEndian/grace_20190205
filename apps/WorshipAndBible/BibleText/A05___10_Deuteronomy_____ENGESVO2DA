Deuteronomy 10-1 <pb/>“At that time the LORD said to me, <f>ⓐ</f>‘Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mountain and <f>ⓑ</f>make an ark of wood.
Deuteronomy 10-2 And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, and <f>ⓒ</f>you shall put them in the ark.’
Deuteronomy 10-3 So I made an ark <f>ⓓ</f>of acacia wood, and <f>ⓔ</f>cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
Deuteronomy 10-4 And <f>ⓕ</f>he wrote on the tablets, in the same writing as before, the Ten Commandments <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>that the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire <f>ⓗ</f>on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me.
Deuteronomy 10-5 Then I turned and <f>ⓘ</f>came down from the mountain and <f>ⓙ</f>put the tablets in the ark that I had made. <f>ⓚ</f>And there they are, as the LORD commanded me.”
Deuteronomy 10-6 <pb/>(The people of Israel <f>ⓛ</f>journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan <f>[2]</f> to Moserah. <f>ⓜ</f>There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place.
Deuteronomy 10-7 <f>ⓝ</f> From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water.
Deuteronomy 10-8 At that time <f>ⓞ</f>the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi <f>ⓟ</f>to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD <f>ⓠ</f>to stand before the LORD to minister to him and <f>ⓡ</f>to bless in his name, to this day.
Deuteronomy 10-9 <f>ⓢ</f> Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers. The LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God said to him.)
Deuteronomy 10-10 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> “I myself stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights, <f>ⓤ</f>and the LORD listened to me that time also. The LORD was unwilling to destroy you.
Deuteronomy 10-11 <f>ⓥ</f> And the LORD said to me, ‘Arise, go on your journey at the head of the people, so that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.’
Deuteronomy 10-12 <pb/>“And now, Israel, <f>ⓦ</f>what does the LORD your God require of you, but <f>ⓧ</f>to fear the LORD your God, <f>ⓨ</f>to walk in all his ways, <f>ⓩ</f>to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
Deuteronomy 10-13 and <f>ⓐ</f>to keep the commandments and statutes of the LORD, which I am commanding you today <f>ⓑ</f>for your good?
Deuteronomy 10-14 Behold, <f>ⓒ</f>to the LORD your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, <f>ⓓ</f>the earth with all that is in it.
Deuteronomy 10-15 Yet <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day.
Deuteronomy 10-16 Circumcise therefore <f>ⓕ</f>the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer <f>ⓖ</f>stubborn.
Deuteronomy 10-17 For the LORD your God is <f>ⓗ</f>God of gods and <f>ⓘ</f>Lord of lords, <f>ⓙ</f>the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is <f>ⓚ</f>not partial and takes no bribe.
Deuteronomy 10-18 <f>ⓛ</f> He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing.
Deuteronomy 10-19 <f>ⓜ</f> Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 10-20 <f>ⓝ</f> You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and <f>ⓞ</f>hold fast to him, and <f>ⓟ</f>by his name you shall swear.
Deuteronomy 10-21 <f>ⓠ</f> He is your praise. He is your God, <f>ⓡ</f>who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen.
Deuteronomy 10-22 Your fathers went down to Egypt <f>ⓢ</f>seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you <f>ⓣ</f>as numerous as the stars of heaven.
