2 Peter 1-1 <pb/>Simeon <f>[1]</f> Peter, a servant <f>[2]</f> and apostle of Jesus Christ, <pb/>To those who have obtained <f>ⓐ</f>a faith of equal standing with ours <f>ⓑ</f>by the righteousness of our <f>ⓒ</f>God and Savior Jesus Christ:
2 Peter 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> May grace and peace be multiplied to you <f>ⓔ</f>in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
2 Peter 1-3 <pb/>His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him <f>ⓕ</f>who called us to <f>[3]</f> his own glory and excellence, <f>[4]</f>
2 Peter 1-4 by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become <f>ⓖ</f>partakers of the divine nature, <f>ⓗ</f>having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
2 Peter 1-5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith <f>ⓘ</f>with virtue, <f>[5]</f> and virtue <f>ⓙ</f>with knowledge,
2 Peter 1-6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control <f>ⓚ</f>with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness,
2 Peter 1-7 and godliness <f>ⓛ</f>with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection <f>ⓜ</f>with love.
2 Peter 1-8 For if these qualities <f>[6]</f> are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or <f>ⓝ</f>unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Peter 1-9 For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he <f>ⓞ</f>is blind, having forgotten that he was <f>ⓟ</f>cleansed from his former sins.
2 Peter 1-10 Therefore, brothers, <f>[7]</f> be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and <f>ⓠ</f>election, for if you practice these qualities <f>ⓡ</f>you will never fall.
2 Peter 1-11 For in this way there will be richly provided for you <f>ⓢ</f>an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2 Peter 1-12 <pb/>Therefore I intend <f>ⓣ</f>always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in <f>ⓤ</f>the truth that you have.
2 Peter 1-13 I think it right, as long as I am in this <f>ⓥ</f>body, <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓦ</f>to stir you up by way of reminder,
2 Peter 1-14 <f>ⓧ</f> since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, <f>ⓨ</f>as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
2 Peter 1-15 And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.
2 Peter 1-16 <pb/>For we did not follow <f>ⓩ</f>cleverly devised <f>ⓐ</f>myths when we made known to you <f>ⓑ</f>the power and <f>ⓒ</f>coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but <f>ⓓ</f>we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
2 Peter 1-17 For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, <f>ⓔ</f>“This is my beloved Son, <f>[9]</f> with whom I am well pleased,”
2 Peter 1-18 we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on <f>ⓕ</f>the holy mountain.
2 Peter 1-19 And <f>ⓖ</f>we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention <f>ⓗ</f>as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until <f>ⓘ</f>the day <f>ⓙ</f>dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,
2 Peter 1-20 knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation.
2 Peter 1-21 For <f>ⓚ</f>no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God <f>ⓛ</f>as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
