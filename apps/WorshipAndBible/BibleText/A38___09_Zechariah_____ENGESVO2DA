Zechariah 9-1 <pb/><t>The oracle of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>Damascus is its resting place. </t><t>For the LORD has an eye on mankind </t><t>and on all the tribes of Israel, <f>[1]</f></t>
Zechariah 9-2 <t><f>ⓑ</f> and on Hamath also, which borders on it, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>Tyre and <f>ⓓ</f>Sidon, though <f>ⓔ</f>they are very wise.</t>
Zechariah 9-3 <t>Tyre has built herself <f>ⓕ</f>a rampart </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>heaped up silver like dust, </t><t>and fine gold like the mud of the streets.</t>
Zechariah 9-4 <t>But behold, the Lord will strip her of her possessions </t><t>and strike down <f>ⓗ</f>her power on the sea, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>she shall be devoured by fire. </t>
Zechariah 9-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Ashkelon shall see it, and be afraid; </t><t>Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; </t><t>Ekron also, because its hopes are confounded. </t><t>The king shall perish from Gaza; </t><t>Ashkelon shall be uninhabited;</t>
Zechariah 9-6 <t><f>ⓚ</f> a mixed people <f>[2]</f> shall dwell in Ashdod, </t><t>and I will cut off the pride of Philistia.</t>
Zechariah 9-7 <t>I will take away <f>ⓛ</f>its blood from its mouth, </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>its abominations from between its teeth; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>it too shall be a remnant for our God; </t><t>it shall be like <f>ⓞ</f>a clan in Judah, </t><t>and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites.</t>
Zechariah 9-8 <t>Then <f>ⓟ</f>I will encamp at my house as a guard, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>so that none shall march to and fro; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>no oppressor shall again march over them, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>for now I see with my own eyes. </t>
Zechariah 9-9 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! </t><t>Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>Behold, <f>ⓥ</f>your king is coming to you; </t><t>righteous and having salvation is he, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>humble and mounted on a donkey, </t><t>on a colt, the foal of a donkey.</t>
Zechariah 9-10 <t><f>ⓧ</f> I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>the war horse from Jerusalem; </t><t>and the battle bow shall be cut off, </t><t>and <f>ⓩ</f>he shall speak peace to the nations; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>his rule shall be from sea to sea, </t><t>and from <f>ⓑ</f>the River <f>[3]</f> to the ends of the earth.</t>
Zechariah 9-11 <t>As for you also, because of <f>ⓒ</f>the blood of my covenant with you, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>I will set your prisoners free from <f>ⓔ</f>the waterless pit.</t>
Zechariah 9-12 <t>Return to your stronghold, O <f>ⓕ</f>prisoners of hope; </t><t>today I declare that <f>ⓖ</f>I will restore to you double.</t>
Zechariah 9-13 <t>For <f>ⓗ</f>I have bent Judah as my bow; </t><t>I have made Ephraim its arrow. </t><t>I will stir up your sons, O Zion, </t><t>against your sons, <f>ⓘ</f>O Greece, </t><t>and wield you like a warrior's sword. </t>
Zechariah 9-14 <pb/><t>Then the LORD will appear over them, </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>his arrow will go forth like lightning; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet </t><t>and will march forth in <f>ⓛ</f>the whirlwinds <f>ⓜ</f>of the south.</t>
Zechariah 9-15 <t>The LORD of hosts <f>ⓝ</f>will protect them, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>they shall devour, <f>ⓟ</f>and tread down the sling stones, </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>they shall drink and roar as if drunk with wine, </t><t>and be full like a bowl, </t><t>drenched <f>ⓡ</f>like the corners of the altar. </t>
Zechariah 9-16 <pb/><t>On that day the LORD their God will save them, </t><t>as <f>ⓢ</f>the flock of his people; </t><t>for <f>ⓣ</f>like the jewels of a crown </t><t>they shall shine on his land.</t>
Zechariah 9-17 <t><f>ⓤ</f> For how great is his goodness, and how great his beauty! </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>Grain shall make the young men flourish, </t><t>and new wine the young women. </t>
