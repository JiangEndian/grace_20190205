Nehemiah 13-1 <pb/>On that day <f>ⓐ</f>they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people. And in it was found written <f>ⓑ</f>that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
Nehemiah 13-2 for they did not meet the people of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them — yet our God turned the curse into a blessing.
Nehemiah 13-3 As soon as the people heard the law, <f>ⓒ</f>they separated from Israel all <f>ⓓ</f>those of foreign descent.
Nehemiah 13-4 <pb/>Now before this, <f>ⓔ</f>Eliashib the priest, who <f>ⓕ</f>was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and who was related to <f>ⓖ</f>Tobiah,
Nehemiah 13-5 prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had previously put the grain offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, <f>ⓗ</f>which were given by commandment to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.
Nehemiah 13-6 While this was taking place, I was not in Jerusalem, for <f>ⓘ</f>in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes <f>ⓙ</f>king of Babylon I went to the king. And after some time I asked leave of the king
Nehemiah 13-7 and came to Jerusalem, and I then discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, <f>ⓚ</f>preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
Nehemiah 13-8 And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the chamber.
Nehemiah 13-9 Then I gave orders, and they <f>ⓛ</f>cleansed the chambers, and I brought back there the vessels of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.
Nehemiah 13-10 <pb/>I also found out that <f>ⓜ</f>the portions of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each <f>ⓝ</f>to his field.
Nehemiah 13-11 <f>ⓞ</f> So I confronted the officials and said, <f>ⓟ</f>“Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their stations.
Nehemiah 13-12 Then all Judah brought <f>ⓠ</f>the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses.
Nehemiah 13-13 And <f>ⓡ</f>I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, <f>ⓢ</f>for they were considered reliable, and their duty was to distribute to their brothers.
Nehemiah 13-14 <f>ⓣ</f> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.
Nehemiah 13-15 <pb/>In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses <f>ⓤ</f>on the Sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, <f>ⓥ</f>which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And <f>ⓦ</f>I warned them on the day when they sold food.
Nehemiah 13-16 Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah, in Jerusalem itself!
Nehemiah 13-17 <f>ⓧ</f> Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, <f>ⓨ</f>profaning the Sabbath day?
Nehemiah 13-18 <f>ⓩ</f> Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster <f>[1]</f> on us and on this city? Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”
Nehemiah 13-19 <pb/>As soon as it <f>ⓐ</f>began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I stationed some of my servants at the gates, that no load might be brought in on the Sabbath day.
Nehemiah 13-20 Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah 13-21 <f>ⓑ</f> But I warned them and said to them, “Why do you lodge outside the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.
Nehemiah 13-22 Then I commanded the Levites <f>ⓒ</f>that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the Sabbath day holy. <f>ⓓ</f>Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love.
Nehemiah 13-23 <pb/>In those days also I saw the Jews <f>ⓔ</f>who had married women <f>ⓕ</f>of Ashdod, <f>ⓖ</f>Ammon, and <f>ⓗ</f>Moab.
Nehemiah 13-24 And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people.
Nehemiah 13-25 <f>ⓘ</f> And I confronted them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair. <f>ⓙ</f>And I made them take an oath in the name of God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
Nehemiah 13-26 <f>ⓚ</f> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? <f>ⓛ</f>Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was <f>ⓜ</f>beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, foreign women made even him to sin.
Nehemiah 13-27 Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and <f>ⓝ</f>act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?”
Nehemiah 13-28 <pb/>And one of the sons of <f>ⓞ</f>Jehoiada, the son of <f>ⓟ</f>Eliashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of <f>ⓠ</f>Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I chased him from me.
Nehemiah 13-29 <f>ⓡ</f> Remember them, O my God, because they have desecrated the priesthood <f>ⓢ</f>and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
Nehemiah 13-30 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work;
Nehemiah 13-31 and I provided <f>ⓤ</f>for the wood offering <f>ⓥ</f>at appointed times, and for the firstfruits. <pb/><f>ⓦ</f>Remember me, O my God, for good.
