Amos 5-1 <pb/>Hear this word that I <f>ⓐ</f>take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:
Amos 5-2 <pb/><t>“Fallen, no more to rise, </t><t>is <f>ⓑ</f>the virgin Israel; </t><t>forsaken on her land, </t><t>with none to raise her up.” </t>
Amos 5-3 <pb/>For thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t>“The city that went out a thousand </t><t>shall have a hundred left, </t><t>and that which went out a hundred </t><t>shall have ten left </t><t>to the house of Israel.” </t>
Amos 5-4 <pb/>For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel: <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Seek me and live;</t>
Amos 5-5 <t>but do not seek <f>ⓓ</f>Bethel, </t><t>and do not enter into <f>ⓔ</f>Gilgal </t><t>or cross over to <f>ⓕ</f>Beersheba; </t><t>for <f>ⓖ</f>Gilgal shall surely go into exile, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>Bethel shall come to nothing.” </t>
Amos 5-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Seek the LORD and live, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, </t><t>and it devour, with none to quench it for <f>ⓚ</f>Bethel,</t>
Amos 5-7 <t>O <f>ⓛ</f>you who turn justice to wormwood <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and cast down righteousness to the earth! </t>
Amos 5-8 <pb/><t>He who made the <f>ⓜ</f>Pleiades and Orion, </t><t>and turns deep darkness into the morning </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>darkens the day into night, </t><t>who <f>ⓞ</f>calls for the waters of the sea </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>and pours them out on the surface of the earth, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>the LORD is his name;</t>
Amos 5-9 <t><f>ⓡ</f> who makes destruction flash forth against the strong, </t><t>so that destruction comes upon the fortress. </t>
Amos 5-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓢ</f> They hate him who reproves <f>ⓣ</f>in the gate, </t><t>and they <f>ⓤ</f>abhor him who speaks the truth.</t>
Amos 5-11 <t>Therefore because you <f>ⓥ</f>trample on <f>[2]</f> the poor </t><t>and you exact taxes of grain from him, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>you have built houses of hewn stone, </t><t>but you shall not dwell in them; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>you have planted pleasant vineyards, </t><t>but you shall not drink their wine.</t>
Amos 5-12 <t>For I know how many are your transgressions </t><t>and how great are your sins — </t><t>you who afflict the righteous, who <f>ⓨ</f>take a bribe, </t><t>and <f>ⓩ</f>turn aside the needy <f>ⓐ</f>in the gate.</t>
Amos 5-13 <t>Therefore he who is prudent will <f>ⓑ</f>keep silent in such a time, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>for it is an evil time. </t>
Amos 5-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> Seek good, and not evil, </t><t>that you may live; </t><t>and so the LORD, <f>ⓔ</f>the God of hosts, will be with you, </t><t>as you have said.</t>
Amos 5-15 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Hate evil, and love good, </t><t>and establish justice <f>ⓖ</f>in the gate; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>it may be that the LORD, the God of hosts, </t><t>will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph. </t>
Amos 5-16 <pb/>Therefore thus says the LORD, <f>ⓘ</f>the God of hosts, the Lord: <pb/><t>“In all the squares <f>ⓙ</f>there shall be wailing, </t><t>and in all the streets they shall say, ‘Alas! Alas!’ </t><t>They shall call the farmers to mourning </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>to wailing those who are skilled in lamentation,</t>
Amos 5-17 <t>and in all vineyards there shall be wailing, </t><t>for <f>ⓛ</f>I will pass through your midst,” <pb/>says the LORD. </t>
Amos 5-18 <pb/><t>Woe to you who desire <f>ⓜ</f>the day of the LORD! </t><t>Why would you have the day of the LORD? </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>It is darkness, and not light,</t>
Amos 5-19 <t><f>ⓞ</f> as if a man fled from a lion, </t><t>and a bear met him, </t><t>or went into the house and leaned his hand against the wall, </t><t>and a serpent bit him.</t>
Amos 5-20 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Is not the day of the LORD darkness, and not light, </t><t>and gloom with no brightness in it? </t>
Amos 5-21 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> “I hate, I despise your feasts, </t><t>and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies.</t>
Amos 5-22 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings, </t><t>I will not accept them; </t><t>and the peace offerings of your fattened animals, </t><t>I will not look upon them.</t>
Amos 5-23 <t>Take away from me the noise of your songs; </t><t>to <f>ⓢ</f>the melody of your harps I will not listen.</t>
Amos 5-24 <t>But let justice roll down like waters, </t><t>and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream. </t>
Amos 5-25 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> “Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
Amos 5-26 <f>ⓤ</f> You <f>ⓥ</f>shall take up Sikkuth your king, and Kiyyun your star-god — your images that you made for yourselves,
Amos 5-27 <f>ⓦ</f> and I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the LORD, whose name is <f>ⓧ</f>the God of hosts.
