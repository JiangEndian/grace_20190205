1 John 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> That which was <f>ⓑ</f>from the beginning, <f>ⓒ</f>which we have heard, <f>ⓓ</f>which we have seen with our eyes, <f>ⓔ</f>which we looked upon and <f>ⓕ</f>have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life —
1 John 1-2 <f>ⓖ</f> the life <f>ⓗ</f>was made manifest, and we have seen it, and <f>ⓘ</f>testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, <f>ⓙ</f>which was with the Father and <f>ⓚ</f>was made manifest to us —
1 John 1-3 <f>ⓛ</f> that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed <f>ⓜ</f>our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
1 John 1-4 And we are writing these things so <f>ⓝ</f>that our <f>[1]</f> joy may be complete.
1 John 1-5 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that <f>ⓟ</f>God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
1 John 1-6 <f>ⓠ</f> If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and <f>ⓡ</f>do not practice the truth.
1 John 1-7 But <f>ⓢ</f>if we walk in the light, <f>ⓣ</f>as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and <f>ⓤ</f>the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
1 John 1-8 <f>ⓥ</f> If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and <f>ⓦ</f>the truth is not in us.
1 John 1-9 <f>ⓧ</f> If we confess our sins, he is <f>ⓨ</f>faithful and just to forgive us our sins and <f>ⓩ</f>to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1 John 1-10 If we say we have not sinned, <f>ⓐ</f>we make him a liar, and <f>ⓑ</f>his word is not in us.
