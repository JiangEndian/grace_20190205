Luke 7-1 <pb/>After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, <f>ⓐ</f>he entered Capernaum.
Luke 7-2 Now a centurion had a servant <f>[1]</f> who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him.
Luke 7-3 When the centurion <f>[2]</f> heard about Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant.
Luke 7-4 And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, <f>ⓒ</f>“He is worthy to have you do this for him,
Luke 7-5 for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us <f>ⓓ</f>our synagogue.”
Luke 7-6 And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, <f>ⓔ</f>do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.
Luke 7-7 Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But <f>ⓕ</f>say the word, and let my servant be healed.
Luke 7-8 For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
Luke 7-9 When Jesus heard these things, <f>ⓖ</f>he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, <J>“I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such <f>ⓗ</f>faith.”</J>
Luke 7-10 And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.
Luke 7-11 <pb/>Soon afterward <f>[3]</f> he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him.
Luke 7-12 As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, <f>ⓘ</f>the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her.
Luke 7-13 And when the Lord saw her, <f>ⓙ</f>he had compassion on her and <f>ⓚ</f>said to her, <J>“Do not weep.”</J>
Luke 7-14 Then he came up and touched <f>ⓛ</f>the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, <J>“Young man, I say to you, <f>ⓜ</f>arise.”</J>
Luke 7-15 And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>gave him to his mother.
Luke 7-16 Fear seized them all, and <f>ⓞ</f>they glorified God, saying, <f>ⓟ</f>“A great prophet has arisen among us!” and <f>ⓠ</f>“God has visited his people!”
Luke 7-17 And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.
Luke 7-18 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> <f>ⓢ</f>The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John,
Luke 7-19 calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one <f>ⓣ</f>who is to come, or <f>ⓤ</f>shall we look for another?”
Luke 7-20 And when the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one <f>ⓥ</f>who is to come, or <f>ⓦ</f>shall we look for another?’”
Luke 7-21 In that hour <f>ⓧ</f>he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and <f>ⓨ</f>on many who were blind he bestowed sight.
Luke 7-22 And he answered them, <J>“Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: <f>ⓩ</f>the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, <f>ⓐ</f>lepers <f>[5]</f> are cleansed, and <f>ⓑ</f>the deaf hear, <f>ⓒ</f>the dead are raised up, <f>ⓓ</f>the poor have good news preached to them.</J>
Luke 7-23 <J>And blessed is the one who is <f>ⓔ</f>not offended by me.”</J>
Luke 7-24 <pb/>When John's messengers had gone, Jesus <f>[6]</f> began to speak to the crowds concerning John: <J>“What did you go out <f>ⓕ</f>into the wilderness to see? <f>ⓖ</f>A reed shaken by the wind?</J>
Luke 7-25 <J>What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts.</J>
Luke 7-26 <J>What then did you go out to see? <f>ⓗ</f>A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</J>
Luke 7-27 <J>This is he of whom it is written,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓘ</f>“‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,</J> </t><t><J>who will prepare your way before you.’</J> </t>
Luke 7-28 <pb/><J>I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”</J>
Luke 7-29 (<f>ⓙ</f>When all the people heard this, and <f>ⓚ</f>the tax collectors too, they declared God just, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>having been baptized with <f>ⓜ</f>the baptism of John,
Luke 7-30 <f>ⓝ</f> but the Pharisees and <f>ⓞ</f>the lawyers <f>ⓟ</f>rejected <f>ⓠ</f>the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)
Luke 7-31 <pb/><J>“To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?</J>
Luke 7-32 <J>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another,</J> <pb/><t><J>“‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;</J> </t><t><J>we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’</J> </t>
Luke 7-33 <pb/><J>For John the Baptist has come <f>ⓡ</f>eating no bread and <f>ⓢ</f>drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’</J>
Luke 7-34 <J>The Son of Man has come <f>ⓣ</f>eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, <f>ⓤ</f>a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</J>
Luke 7-35 <J>Yet <f>ⓥ</f>wisdom is justified by all her children.”</J>
Luke 7-36 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at table.
Luke 7-37 <f>ⓧ</f> And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,
Luke 7-38 and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and <f>ⓨ</f>wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
Luke 7-39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If <f>ⓩ</f>this man were <f>ⓐ</f>a prophet, he <f>ⓑ</f>would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.”
Luke 7-40 And Jesus answering said to him, <J>“Simon, I have something to say to you.”</J> And he answered, “Say it, Teacher.”
Luke 7-41 <pb/><J>“A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred <f>ⓒ</f>denarii, and the other fifty.</J>
Luke 7-42 <J><f>ⓓ</f> When they could not pay, he <f>ⓔ</f>cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?”</J>
Luke 7-43 Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.” And he said to him, <J>“You have judged rightly.”</J>
Luke 7-44 Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, <J>“Do you see this woman? I entered your house; <f>ⓕ</f>you gave me no water for my feet, but <f>ⓖ</f>she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</J>
Luke 7-45 <J><f>ⓗ</f> You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to <f>ⓘ</f>kiss my feet.</J>
Luke 7-46 <J><f>ⓙ</f> You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</J>
Luke 7-47 <J>Therefore I tell you, her sins, <f>ⓚ</f>which are many, are forgiven — for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.”</J>
Luke 7-48 And he said to her, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“Your sins are forgiven.”</J>
Luke 7-49 Then those who were at table with him began to say among <f>[8]</f> themselves, <f>ⓜ</f>“Who is this, who even forgives sins?”
Luke 7-50 And he said to the woman, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“Your faith has saved you; <f>ⓞ</f>go in peace.”</J>
