John 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the beginning was <f>ⓑ</f>the Word, and <f>ⓒ</f>the Word was with God, and <f>ⓓ</f>the Word was God.
John 1-2 He was in the beginning with God.
John 1-3 <f>ⓔ</f> All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
John 1-4 <f>ⓕ</f> In him was life, <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>the life was the light of men.
John 1-5 <f>ⓗ</f> The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
John 1-6 <pb/>There was a man <f>ⓘ</f>sent from God, whose name was <f>ⓙ</f>John.
John 1-7 He came as a <f>ⓚ</f>witness, to bear witness about the light, <f>ⓛ</f>that all might believe through him.
John 1-8 <f>ⓜ</f> He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.
John 1-9 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
John 1-10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet <f>ⓞ</f>the world did not know him.
John 1-11 He came to <f>ⓟ</f>his own, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓠ</f>his own people <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>did not receive him.
John 1-12 But to all who did receive him, <f>ⓢ</f>who believed in his name, <f>ⓣ</f>he gave the right <f>ⓤ</f>to become <f>ⓥ</f>children of God,
John 1-13 who <f>ⓦ</f>were born, <f>ⓧ</f>not of blood <f>ⓨ</f>nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
John 1-14 <pb/>And <f>ⓩ</f>the Word <f>ⓐ</f>became flesh and <f>ⓑ</f>dwelt among us, <f>ⓒ</f>and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son <f>[4]</f> from the Father, full of <f>ⓓ</f>grace and <f>ⓔ</f>truth.
John 1-15 (<f>ⓕ</f>John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, <f>ⓖ</f>‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)
John 1-16 For from <f>ⓗ</f>his fullness we have all received, <f>ⓘ</f>grace upon grace. <f>[5]</f>
John 1-17 For <f>ⓙ</f>the law was given through Moses; <f>ⓚ</f>grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
John 1-18 <f>ⓛ</f> No one has ever seen God; <f>ⓜ</f>the only God, <f>[6]</f> who is at the Father's side, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>he has made him known.
John 1-19 <pb/>And this is the <f>ⓞ</f>testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, <f>ⓟ</f>“Who are you?”
John 1-20 <f>ⓠ</f> He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”
John 1-21 And they asked him, “What then? <f>ⓡ</f>Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you <f>ⓢ</f>the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”
John 1-22 So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
John 1-23 He said, “I am <f>ⓣ</f>the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight <f>[8]</f> the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
John 1-24 <pb/>(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)
John 1-25 They asked him, <f>ⓤ</f>“Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
John 1-26 John answered them, <f>ⓥ</f>“I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know,
John 1-27 even <f>ⓦ</f>he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”
John 1-28 These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John 1-29 <pb/>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, <f>ⓧ</f>the Lamb of God, who <f>ⓨ</f>takes away the sin <f>ⓩ</f>of the world!
John 1-30 This is he of whom I said, <f>ⓐ</f>‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’
John 1-31 I myself did not know him, but <f>ⓑ</f>for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”
John 1-32 And John <f>ⓒ</f>bore witness: <f>ⓓ</f>“I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and <f>ⓔ</f>it remained on him.
John 1-33 I myself did not know him, but <f>ⓕ</f>he who sent me to baptize <f>ⓖ</f>with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, <f>ⓗ</f>this is he who baptizes <f>ⓘ</f>with the Holy Spirit.’
John 1-34 And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son <f>[9]</f> of God.”
John 1-35 <pb/>The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples,
John 1-36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>the Lamb of God!”
John 1-37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.
John 1-38 Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“What are you seeking?”</J> And they said to him, <f>ⓛ</f>“Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”
John 1-39 He said to them, <J>“Come and you will see.”</J> So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. <f>[10]</f>
John 1-40 <f>ⓜ</f> One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus <f>[11]</f> was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
John 1-41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found <f>ⓝ</f>the Messiah” (which means Christ).
John 1-42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, <J>“You are Simon the son of <f>ⓞ</f>John. You shall be called <f>ⓟ</f>Cephas”</J> (which means <f>ⓠ</f>Peter <f>[12]</f>).
John 1-43 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> The next day Jesus decided <f>ⓢ</f>to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, <J>“Follow me.”</J>
John 1-44 Now <f>ⓣ</f>Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
John 1-45 Philip found <f>ⓤ</f>Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom <f>ⓥ</f>Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus <f>ⓦ</f>of Nazareth, <f>ⓧ</f>the son of Joseph.”
John 1-46 Nathanael said to him, <f>ⓨ</f>“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”
John 1-47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, <J>“Behold, <f>ⓩ</f>an Israelite indeed, <f>ⓐ</f>in whom there is no deceit!”</J>
John 1-48 Nathanael said to him, “How <f>ⓑ</f>do you know me?” Jesus answered him, <J>“Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</J>
John 1-49 Nathanael answered him, <f>ⓒ</f>“Rabbi, <f>ⓓ</f>you are the Son of God! You are the <f>ⓔ</f>King of Israel!”
John 1-50 Jesus answered him, <J>“Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”</J>
John 1-51 And he said to him, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>[13]</f> you will see <f>ⓕ</f>heaven opened, and <f>ⓖ</f>the angels of God ascending and descending on <f>ⓗ</f>the Son of Man.”</J>
