Luke 17-1 <pb/>And he said to his disciples, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“Temptations to sin <f>[1]</f> are <f>ⓑ</f>sure to come, but <f>ⓒ</f>woe to the one through whom they come!</J>
Luke 17-2 <J><f>ⓓ</f> It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. <f>[2]</f></J>
Luke 17-3 <J>Pay attention to yourselves! <f>ⓔ</f>If your brother sins, <f>ⓕ</f>rebuke him, and if he repents, <f>ⓖ</f>forgive him,</J>
Luke 17-4 <J>and if he sins against you <f>ⓗ</f>seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”</J>
Luke 17-5 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> The apostles said to the Lord, <f>ⓙ</f>“Increase our faith!”

Luke 17-7 <pb/><J>“Will any one of you who has a servant <f>[3]</f> plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and recline at table’?</J>
Luke 17-8 <J>Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare supper for me, and <f>ⓝ</f>dress properly, <f>[4]</f> and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink’?</J>
Luke 17-9 <J>Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded?</J>
Luke 17-10 <J>So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are <f>ⓞ</f>unworthy servants; <f>[5]</f> we have only done what was our duty.’”</J>
Luke 17-11 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> On the way to Jerusalem <f>ⓠ</f>he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.

Luke 17-13 and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.”
Luke 17-14 When he saw them he said to them, <J>“Go and <f>ⓢ</f>show yourselves to the priests.”</J> And as they went they were cleansed.
Luke 17-15 Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, <f>ⓣ</f>praising God with a loud voice;
Luke 17-16 and <f>ⓤ</f>he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was <f>ⓥ</f>a Samaritan.
Luke 17-17 Then Jesus answered, <J>“Were not <f>ⓦ</f>ten cleansed? Where are the nine?</J>
Luke 17-18 <J>Was no one found to return and <f>ⓧ</f>give praise to God except this <f>ⓨ</f>foreigner?”</J>

Luke 17-20 <pb/>Being asked by the Pharisees <f>ⓑ</f>when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, <J>“The kingdom of God <f>ⓒ</f>is not coming in ways that can be observed,</J>
Luke 17-21 <J>nor <f>ⓓ</f>will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.” <f>[8]</f></J>
Luke 17-22 <pb/>And he said to the disciples, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“The days are coming when you will desire <f>ⓕ</f>to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.</J>
Luke 17-23 <J><f>ⓖ</f> And they will say to you, ‘Look, there!’ or ‘Look, here!’ Do not go out or follow them.</J>
Luke 17-24 <J><f>ⓗ</f> For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be <f>ⓘ</f>in his day. <f>[9]</f></J>
Luke 17-25 <J>But first <f>ⓙ</f>he must suffer many things and <f>ⓚ</f>be rejected by this generation.</J>
Luke 17-26 <J><f>ⓛ</f> Just as it was in the days of <f>ⓜ</f>Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.</J>
Luke 17-27 <J><f>ⓝ</f> They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</J>
Luke 17-28 <J>Likewise, just as it was in the days of <f>ⓞ</f>Lot — they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building,</J>
Luke 17-29 <J><f>ⓟ</f> but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all — </J>
Luke 17-30 <J>so will it be <f>ⓠ</f>on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</J>
Luke 17-31 <J>On that day, <f>ⓡ</f>let the one who is on <f>ⓢ</f>the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back.</J>
Luke 17-32 <J><f>ⓣ</f> Remember Lot's wife.</J>
Luke 17-33 <J><f>ⓤ</f> Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will <f>ⓥ</f>keep it.</J>
Luke 17-34 <J>I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken and the other left.</J>
Luke 17-35 <J><f>ⓦ</f> There will be two women <f>ⓧ</f>grinding together. One will be taken and the other left.” <f>[10]</f></J>
Luke 17-36 
Luke 17-37 And they said to him, “Where, Lord?” He said to them, <J> <f>ⓨ</f>“Where the corpse <f>[11]</f> is, there the vultures <f>[12]</f> will gather.”</J>
