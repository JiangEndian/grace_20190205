John 10-1 <pb/><J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber.</J>
John 10-2 <J>But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</J>
John 10-3 <J>To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</J>
John 10-4 <J>When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</J>
John 10-5 <J><f>ⓐ</f> A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”</J>
John 10-6 This figure of speech Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>used with them, but they <f>ⓒ</f>did not understand what he was saying to them.
John 10-7 <pb/>So Jesus again said to them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓓ</f>I am the door of the sheep.</J>
John 10-8 <J>All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</J>
John 10-9 <J>I am the door. If anyone enters by me, <f>ⓔ</f>he will be saved and will go in and out and <f>ⓕ</f>find pasture.</J>
John 10-10 <J>The thief comes only to steal and <f>ⓖ</f>kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.</J>
John 10-11 <J><f>ⓗ</f> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd <f>ⓘ</f>lays down his life for the sheep.</J>
John 10-12 <J>He who is <f>ⓙ</f>a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and <f>ⓚ</f>leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and <f>ⓛ</f>scatters them.</J>
John 10-13 <J>He flees because <f>ⓜ</f>he is a hired hand and <f>ⓝ</f>cares nothing for the sheep.</J>
John 10-14 <J><f>ⓞ</f> I am the good shepherd. <f>ⓟ</f>I know my own and <f>ⓠ</f>my own know me,</J>
John 10-15 <J><f>ⓡ</f> just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and <f>ⓢ</f>I lay down my life for the sheep.</J>
John 10-16 <J>And <f>ⓣ</f>I have other sheep that are not of this fold. <f>ⓤ</f>I must bring them also, and <f>ⓥ</f>they will listen to my voice. So there will be <f>ⓦ</f>one flock, <f>ⓧ</f>one shepherd.</J>
John 10-17 <J><f>ⓨ</f> For this reason the Father loves me, <f>ⓩ</f>because <f>ⓐ</f>I lay down my life that I may take it up again.</J>
John 10-18 <J><f>ⓑ</f> No one takes it from me, but <f>ⓒ</f>I lay it down <f>ⓓ</f>of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and <f>ⓔ</f>I have authority to take it up again. <f>ⓕ</f>This charge I have received from my Father.”</J>
John 10-19 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.
John 10-20 Many of them said, <f>ⓗ</f>“He has a demon, and <f>ⓘ</f>is insane; why listen to him?”
John 10-21 Others said, “These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. <f>ⓙ</f>Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
John 10-22 <pb/>At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter,
John 10-23 and Jesus was walking in the temple, <f>ⓚ</f>in the colonnade of Solomon.
John 10-24 So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are <f>ⓛ</f>the Christ, <f>ⓜ</f>tell us plainly.”
John 10-25 Jesus answered them, <J>“I told you, and you do not believe. <f>ⓝ</f>The works that I do <f>ⓞ</f>in my Father's name bear witness about me,</J>
John 10-26 <J>but <f>ⓟ</f>you do not believe because you are not among my sheep.</J>
John 10-27 <J><f>ⓠ</f> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</J>
John 10-28 <J><f>ⓡ</f> I give them eternal life, and <f>ⓢ</f>they will never perish, and <f>ⓣ</f>no one will snatch them out of my hand.</J>
John 10-29 <J>My Father, <f>ⓤ</f>who has given them to me, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of <f>ⓦ</f>the Father's hand.</J>
John 10-30 <J><f>ⓧ</f> I and the Father are one.”</J>
John 10-31 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.
John 10-32 Jesus answered them, <J>“I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?”</J>
John 10-33 The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but <f>ⓩ</f>for blasphemy, because you, being a man, <f>ⓐ</f>make yourself God.”
John 10-34 Jesus answered them, <J>“Is it not written in <f>ⓑ</f>your Law, <f>ⓒ</f>‘I said, you are gods’?</J>
John 10-35 <J>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came — and Scripture cannot be <f>ⓓ</f>broken — </J>
John 10-36 <J>do you say of him whom <f>ⓔ</f>the Father consecrated and <f>ⓕ</f>sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because <f>ⓖ</f>I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</J>
John 10-37 <J><f>ⓗ</f> If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;</J>
John 10-38 <J>but if I do them, <f>ⓘ</f>even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that <f>ⓙ</f>the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”</J>
John 10-39 <f>ⓚ</f> Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.
John 10-40 <pb/>He went away again across the Jordan to the place <f>ⓛ</f>where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained.
John 10-41 And many came to him. And they said, “John did no sign, but <f>ⓜ</f>everything that John said about this man was true.”
John 10-42 And <f>ⓝ</f>many believed in him there.
