Exodus 21-1 <pb/>“Now these are the <f>ⓐ</f>rules that you shall set before them.
Exodus 21-2 <f>ⓑ</f> When you buy a Hebrew slave, <f>[1]</f> he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing.
Exodus 21-3 If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him.
Exodus 21-4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone.
Exodus 21-5 But <f>ⓒ</f>if the slave plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’
Exodus 21-6 then his master shall bring him to <f>ⓓ</f>God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.
Exodus 21-7 <pb/>“When a man <f>ⓔ</f>sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.
Exodus 21-8 If she does not please her master, who has designated her <f>[2]</f> for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has broken faith with her.
Exodus 21-9 If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter.
Exodus 21-10 If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or <f>ⓕ</f>her marital rights.

Exodus 21-14 But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning, <f>ⓙ</f>you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.

Exodus 21-18 <pb/>“When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist and the man does not die but takes to his bed,
Exodus 21-19 then if the man rises again and walks outdoors with his staff, he who struck him shall be clear; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall have him thoroughly healed.
Exodus 21-20 <pb/>“When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be avenged.
Exodus 21-21 But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be avenged, for the <f>ⓝ</f>slave is his money.
Exodus 21-22 <pb/>“When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and <f>ⓞ</f>he shall pay as the <f>ⓟ</f>judges determine.
Exodus 21-23 But if there is harm, <f>[4]</f> then you shall pay <f>ⓠ</f>life for life,
Exodus 21-24 <f>ⓡ</f> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
Exodus 21-25 burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
Exodus 21-26 <pb/>“When a man strikes the eye of his slave, male or female, and destroys it, he shall let the slave go free because of his eye.
Exodus 21-27 If he knocks out the tooth of his slave, male or female, he shall let the slave go free because of his tooth.
Exodus 21-28 <pb/>“When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the <f>ⓢ</f>ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall not be liable.
Exodus 21-29 But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
Exodus 21-30 If <f>ⓣ</f>a ransom is imposed on him, then <f>ⓤ</f>he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him.
Exodus 21-31 If it gores a man's son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule.
Exodus 21-32 If the ox gores a slave, male or female, the owner shall give to their master <f>ⓥ</f>thirty shekels <f>[5]</f> of silver, and <f>ⓦ</f>the ox shall be stoned.

Exodus 21-34 the owner of the pit shall make restoration. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead beast shall be his.
Exodus 21-35 <pb/>“When one man's ox butts another's, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and share its price, and the dead beast also they shall share.
Exodus 21-36 Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall repay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his.
