Lamentations 4-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> How the gold has grown dim, </t><t>how the pure gold is changed! </t><t>The holy stones lie scattered </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>at the head of every street. </t>
Lamentations 4-2 <pb/><t>The precious sons of Zion, </t><t>worth their weight in <f>ⓒ</f>fine gold, </t><t>how they are regarded as <f>ⓓ</f>earthen pots, </t><t>the work of a potter's hands! </t>
Lamentations 4-3 <pb/><t>Even jackals offer the breast; </t><t>they nurse their young; </t><t>but the daughter of my people has become cruel, </t><t>like the ostriches in the wilderness. </t>
Lamentations 4-4 <pb/><t>The tongue of the nursing infant <f>ⓔ</f>sticks </t><t>to the roof of its mouth for thirst; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the children beg for food, </t><t>but no one gives to them. </t>
Lamentations 4-5 <pb/><t>Those who once feasted on delicacies </t><t>perish in the streets; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>those who were brought up in purple </t><t>embrace ash heaps. </t>
Lamentations 4-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> For the chastisement <f>[1]</f> of the daughter of my people has been greater </t><t>than the punishment <f>[2]</f> of Sodom, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>which was overthrown in a moment, </t><t>and no hands were wrung for her. <f>[3]</f> </t>
Lamentations 4-7 <pb/><t>Her princes were purer than snow, </t><t>whiter than milk; </t><t>their bodies were more ruddy than coral, </t><t>the beauty of their form <f>[4]</f> was like sapphire. <f>[5]</f> </t>
Lamentations 4-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Now their face is blacker than soot; </t><t>they are not recognized in the streets; </t><t>their skin has shriveled on their bones; </t><t>it has become as dry as wood. </t>
Lamentations 4-9 <pb/><t>Happier were the victims of the sword </t><t>than the victims of hunger, </t><t>who wasted away, pierced </t><t>by lack of the fruits of the field. </t>
Lamentations 4-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> The hands of <f>ⓛ</f>compassionate women </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>have boiled their own children; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>they became their food </t><t>during the destruction of the daughter of my people. </t>
Lamentations 4-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> The LORD gave full vent to his wrath; </t><t>he poured out his hot anger, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>he kindled a fire in Zion </t><t>that consumed its foundations. </t>
Lamentations 4-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> The kings of the earth did not believe, </t><t>nor any of the inhabitants of the world, </t><t>that foe or enemy could enter </t><t>the gates of Jerusalem. </t>
Lamentations 4-13 <pb/><t>This was for <f>ⓡ</f>the sins of her prophets </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>the iniquities of her priests, </t><t>who shed in the midst of her </t><t>the blood of the righteous. </t>
Lamentations 4-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> They wandered, blind, through the streets; </t><t>they were so defiled with blood </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>that no one was able to touch </t><t>their garments. </t>
Lamentations 4-15 <pb/><t>“Away! <f>ⓥ</f>Unclean!” people cried at them. </t><t>“Away! Away! Do not touch!” </t><t>So they became fugitives and wanderers; </t><t>people said among the nations, </t><t>“They shall stay with us no longer.” </t>
Lamentations 4-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> The LORD himself <f>[6]</f> has scattered them; </t><t>he will regard them no more; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>no honor was shown to the priests, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>no favor to the elders. </t>
Lamentations 4-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f> Our eyes failed, ever watching </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>vainly for help; </t><t>in our watching we watched </t><t>for <f>ⓑ</f>a nation which could not save. </t>
Lamentations 4-18 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> They dogged our steps </t><t>so that we could not walk in our streets; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>our end drew near; our days were numbered, </t><t>for our end had come. </t>
Lamentations 4-19 <pb/><t>Our pursuers were <f>ⓔ</f>swifter </t><t>than the eagles in the heavens; </t><t>they chased us on the mountains; </t><t>they lay in wait for us in the wilderness. </t>
Lamentations 4-20 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> The breath of our nostrils, <f>ⓖ</f>the LORD's anointed, </t><t>was captured <f>ⓗ</f>in their pits, </t><t>of whom we said, <f>ⓘ</f>“Under his shadow </t><t>we shall live among the nations.” </t>
Lamentations 4-21 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, </t><t>you who dwell in <f>ⓚ</f>the land of Uz; </t><t>but to you also <f>ⓛ</f>the cup shall pass; </t><t>you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare. </t>
Lamentations 4-22 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished; </t><t>he will keep you in exile no longer; <f>[7]</f> </t><t>but <f>ⓝ</f>your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish; </t><t>he will uncover your sins. </t>
