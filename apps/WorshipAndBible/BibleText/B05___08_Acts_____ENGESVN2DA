Acts 8-1 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>Saul <f>ⓑ</f>approved of his execution. <pb/>And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and <f>ⓒ</f>they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
Acts 8-2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
Acts 8-3 But <f>ⓓ</f>Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he <f>ⓔ</f>dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.
Acts 8-4 <pb/>Now <f>ⓕ</f>those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
Acts 8-5 <f>ⓖ</f> Philip went down to the city <f>[1]</f> of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.
Acts 8-6 <f>ⓗ</f> And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip, when they heard him <f>ⓘ</f>and saw the signs that he did.
Acts 8-7 For <f>ⓙ</f>unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
Acts 8-8 So <f>ⓚ</f>there was much joy in that city.
Acts 8-9 <pb/>But there was a man named Simon, <f>ⓛ</f>who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, <f>ⓜ</f>saying that he himself was somebody great.
Acts 8-10 They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“This man is the power of God that is called <f>ⓞ</f>Great.”
Acts 8-11 And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had <f>ⓟ</f>amazed them with his magic.
Acts 8-12 But when <f>ⓠ</f>they believed Philip as he preached good news <f>ⓡ</f>about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, <f>ⓢ</f>they were baptized, both men and women.
Acts 8-13 Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And <f>ⓣ</f>seeing signs and <f>ⓤ</f>great miracles <f>[2]</f> performed, <f>ⓥ</f>he was amazed.
Acts 8-14 <pb/>Now when <f>ⓦ</f>the apostles at Jerusalem heard that <f>ⓧ</f>Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,
Acts 8-15 who came down and prayed for them <f>ⓨ</f>that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
Acts 8-16 for <f>ⓩ</f>he had not yet <f>ⓐ</f>fallen on any of them, but <f>ⓑ</f>they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts 8-17 Then <f>ⓒ</f>they laid their hands on them and <f>ⓓ</f>they received the Holy Spirit.
Acts 8-18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
Acts 8-19 saying, “Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”
Acts 8-20 But Peter said to him, <f>ⓔ</f>“May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God <f>ⓕ</f>with money!
Acts 8-21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for <f>ⓖ</f>your heart is not right before God.
Acts 8-22 Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, <f>ⓗ</f>if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
Acts 8-23 For I see that you are in <f>ⓘ</f>the gall <f>[3]</f> of bitterness and in <f>ⓙ</f>the bond of iniquity.”
Acts 8-24 And Simon answered, <f>ⓚ</f>“Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”
Acts 8-25 <pb/>Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, <f>ⓛ</f>preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
Acts 8-26 <pb/>Now <f>ⓜ</f>an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Rise and go toward the south <f>[4]</f> to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is a desert place.
Acts 8-27 And he rose and went. And there was an <f>ⓝ</f>Ethiopian, a <f>ⓞ</f>eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, <f>ⓟ</f>who was in charge of all her treasure. <f>ⓠ</f>He had come to Jerusalem to worship
Acts 8-28 and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
Acts 8-29 And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.”
Acts 8-30 So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”
Acts 8-31 And he said, <f>ⓡ</f>“How can I, unless someone <f>ⓢ</f>guides me?” And <f>ⓣ</f>he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
Acts 8-32 Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter </t><t>and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, </t><t>so he opens not his mouth.</t>
Acts 8-33 <t>In his <f>ⓥ</f>humiliation justice was denied him. </t><t>Who can describe his generation? </t><t>For his life is taken away from the earth.” </t>
Acts 8-34 <pb/>And the eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”
Acts 8-35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and <f>ⓦ</f>beginning with this Scripture <f>ⓧ</f>he told him the good news about Jesus.
Acts 8-36 And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! <f>ⓨ</f>What prevents me from being baptized?” <f>[5]</f>
Acts 8-37 
Acts 8-38 And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
Acts 8-39 And when they came up out of the water, <f>ⓩ</f>the Spirit of the Lord <f>ⓐ</f>carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.
Acts 8-40 But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
