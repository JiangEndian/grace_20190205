Exodus 19-1 <pb/>On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that day they <f>ⓐ</f>came into the wilderness of Sinai.
Exodus 19-2 They set out from <f>ⓑ</f>Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness. There Israel encamped before <f>ⓒ</f>the mountain,
Exodus 19-3 while <f>ⓓ</f>Moses went up to God. <f>ⓔ</f>The LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the people of Israel:
Exodus 19-4 <f>ⓕ</f> ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how <f>ⓖ</f>I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
Exodus 19-5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be <f>ⓗ</f>my treasured possession among all peoples, for <f>ⓘ</f>all the earth is mine;
Exodus 19-6 and you shall be to me a <f>ⓙ</f>kingdom of priests and <f>ⓚ</f>a holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the people of Israel.”
Exodus 19-7 <pb/>So Moses came and called the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had commanded him.
Exodus 19-8 <f>ⓛ</f> All the people answered together and said, “All that the LORD has spoken we will do.” And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD.
Exodus 19-9 And the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I am coming to you <f>ⓜ</f>in a thick cloud, that <f>ⓝ</f>the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also <f>ⓞ</f>believe you forever.” <pb/>When Moses told the words of the people to the LORD,
Exodus 19-10 the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the people and <f>ⓟ</f>consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them <f>ⓠ</f>wash their garments
Exodus 19-11 and be ready for the third day. For on the third day <f>ⓡ</f>the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
Exodus 19-12 And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, ‘Take care not to go up into the mountain or touch the edge of it. <f>ⓢ</f>Whoever touches the mountain shall be put to death.
Exodus 19-13 No hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned or shot; <f>[1]</f> whether beast or man, he shall not live.’ When <f>ⓣ</f>the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.”
Exodus 19-14 So Moses <f>ⓤ</f>went down from the mountain to the people and <f>ⓥ</f>consecrated the people; <f>ⓦ</f>and they washed their garments.
Exodus 19-15 And he said to the people, “Be ready for the <f>ⓧ</f>third day; <f>ⓨ</f>do not go near a woman.”
Exodus 19-16 <pb/>On the morning of the <f>ⓩ</f>third day there were <f>ⓐ</f>thunders and lightnings and <f>ⓑ</f>a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud <f>ⓒ</f>trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp <f>ⓓ</f>trembled.
Exodus 19-17 Then <f>ⓔ</f>Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus 19-18 Now <f>ⓕ</f>Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and <f>ⓖ</f>the whole mountain trembled greatly.
Exodus 19-19 And as the <f>ⓗ</f>sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and <f>ⓘ</f>God answered him in thunder.
Exodus 19-20 The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
Exodus 19-21 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD <f>ⓙ</f>to look and many of them perish.
Exodus 19-22 Also let the priests who come near to the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>consecrate themselves, lest the LORD <f>ⓛ</f>break out against them.”
Exodus 19-23 And Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>‘Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.’”
Exodus 19-24 And the LORD said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people <f>ⓝ</f>break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break out against them.”
Exodus 19-25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
