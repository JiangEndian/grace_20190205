Deuteronomy 18-1 <pb/>“The Levitical priests, all the tribe of Levi, <f>ⓐ</f>shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel. They <f>ⓑ</f>shall eat the LORD's food offerings <f>[1]</f> as their <f>[2]</f> inheritance.
Deuteronomy 18-2 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them.
Deuteronomy 18-3 And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from those offering a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep: <f>ⓒ</f>they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach.
Deuteronomy 18-4 <f>ⓓ</f> The firstfruits of your grain, of your wine and of your oil, and the first fleece of your sheep, you shall give him.
Deuteronomy 18-5 For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes <f>ⓔ</f>to stand and minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for all time.
Deuteronomy 18-6 <pb/>“And if a Levite comes from any of your towns out of all Israel, <f>ⓕ</f>where he lives — and he may come when he desires <f>[3]</f> — <f>ⓖ</f>to the place that the LORD will choose,
Deuteronomy 18-7 and ministers in the name of the LORD his God, <f>ⓗ</f>like all his fellow Levites who stand to minister there before the LORD,
Deuteronomy 18-8 then he may have equal <f>ⓘ</f>portions to eat, besides what he receives from the sale of his patrimony. <f>[4]</f>
Deuteronomy 18-9 <pb/>“When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, <f>ⓙ</f>you shall not learn to follow the abominable practices of those nations.
Deuteronomy 18-10 There shall not be found among you anyone <f>ⓚ</f>who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, <f>[5]</f> anyone who <f>ⓛ</f>practices divination or <f>ⓜ</f>tells fortunes or interprets omens, or <f>ⓝ</f>a sorcerer
Deuteronomy 18-11 or a charmer or <f>ⓞ</f>a medium or a necromancer or <f>ⓟ</f>one who inquires of the dead,
Deuteronomy 18-12 <f>ⓠ</f> for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD. And <f>ⓡ</f>because of these abominations the LORD your God is driving them out before you.
Deuteronomy 18-13 You shall be blameless before the LORD your God,
Deuteronomy 18-14 for these nations, which you are about to dispossess, listen to fortune-tellers and to diviners. But as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do this.
Deuteronomy 18-15 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers — it is to him you shall listen —
Deuteronomy 18-16 just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb <f>ⓣ</f>on the day of the assembly, when you said, <f>ⓤ</f>‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.’
Deuteronomy 18-17 And the LORD said to me, <f>ⓥ</f>‘They are right in what they have spoken.
Deuteronomy 18-18 <f>ⓦ</f> I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. <f>ⓧ</f>And I will put my words in his mouth, and <f>ⓨ</f>he shall speak to them all that I command him.
Deuteronomy 18-19 <f>ⓩ</f> And whoever will <f>ⓐ</f>not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him.
Deuteronomy 18-20 <f>ⓑ</f> But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or <f>[6]</f> who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.’
Deuteronomy 18-21 And if you say in your heart, ‘How may we know the word that the LORD has not spoken?’ —
Deuteronomy 18-22 <f>ⓒ</f> when a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the LORD has not spoken; <f>ⓓ</f>the prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You need not be afraid of him.
