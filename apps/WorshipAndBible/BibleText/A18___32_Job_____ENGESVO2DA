Job 32-1 <pb/>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was <f>ⓐ</f>righteous in his own eyes.
Job 32-2 Then Elihu the son of Barachel <f>ⓑ</f>the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself <f>ⓒ</f>rather than God.
Job 32-3 He burned with anger also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had <f>ⓓ</f>declared Job to be in the wrong.
Job 32-4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.
Job 32-5 And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger.
Job 32-6 <pb/>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: <pb/><t>“I am young in years, </t><t>and you are <f>ⓔ</f>aged; </t><t>therefore I was timid and afraid </t><t>to declare my opinion to you.</t>
Job 32-7 <t>I said, ‘Let days speak, </t><t>and many years teach wisdom.’</t>
Job 32-8 <t>But it is <f>ⓕ</f>the spirit in man, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the breath of the Almighty, that makes him <f>ⓗ</f>understand.</t>
Job 32-9 <t><f>ⓘ</f> It is not the old <f>[1]</f> who are wise, </t><t>nor the aged who understand what is right.</t>
Job 32-10 <t>Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; </t><t>let me also declare my opinion.’ </t>
Job 32-11 <pb/><t>“Behold, I waited for your words, </t><t>I listened for your wise sayings, </t><t>while you searched out what to say.</t>
Job 32-12 <t>I gave you my attention, </t><t>and, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job </t><t>or who answered his words.</t>
Job 32-13 <t>Beware <f>ⓙ</f>lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom; </t><t>God may vanquish him, not a man.’</t>
Job 32-14 <t>He has not directed his words against me, </t><t>and I will not answer him with your speeches. </t>
Job 32-15 <pb/><t>“They are dismayed; they answer no more; </t><t>they have not a word to say.</t>
Job 32-16 <t>And shall I wait, because they do not speak, </t><t>because they stand there, and answer no more?</t>
Job 32-17 <t>I also will answer with my share; </t><t>I also will declare my opinion.</t>
Job 32-18 <t>For I am full of words; </t><t>the spirit within me constrains me.</t>
Job 32-19 <t>Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; </t><t>like new <f>ⓚ</f>wineskins ready to burst.</t>
Job 32-20 <t><f>ⓛ</f> I must speak, that I may find <f>ⓜ</f>relief; </t><t>I must open my lips and answer.</t>
Job 32-21 <t>I will not <f>ⓝ</f>show partiality to any man </t><t>or use flattery toward any person.</t>
Job 32-22 <t>For I do not know how to flatter, </t><t>else my Maker would soon take me away. </t>
