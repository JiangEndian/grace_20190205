Luke 19-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> He entered Jericho and was passing through.
Luke 19-2 And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich.
Luke 19-3 And <f>ⓑ</f>he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature.
Luke 19-4 So he ran on ahead and climbed up into <f>ⓒ</f>a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way.
Luke 19-5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, <J>“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for <f>ⓓ</f>I must stay at your house today.”</J>
Luke 19-6 So he hurried and came down and <f>ⓔ</f>received him joyfully.
Luke 19-7 And when they saw it, they all <f>ⓕ</f>grumbled, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”
Luke 19-8 And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods <f>ⓖ</f>I give to the poor. And if I have <f>ⓗ</f>defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it <f>ⓘ</f>fourfold.”
Luke 19-9 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Today salvation has come to this house, since <f>ⓙ</f>he also is a son of Abraham.</J>
Luke 19-10 <J>For <f>ⓚ</f>the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</J>
Luke 19-11 <pb/>As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because <f>ⓛ</f>they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
Luke 19-12 He said therefore, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</J>
Luke 19-13 <J>Calling <f>ⓝ</f>ten of his servants, <f>[1]</f> he gave them ten minas, <f>[2]</f> and said to them, ‘Engage in business <f>ⓞ</f>until I come.’</J>
Luke 19-14 <J>But <f>ⓟ</f>his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’</J>
Luke 19-15 <J>When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.</J>
Luke 19-16 <J>The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.’</J>
Luke 19-17 <J>And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! <f>[3]</f> Because you have been <f>ⓠ</f>faithful in a very little, <f>ⓡ</f>you shall have authority over ten cities.’</J>
Luke 19-18 <J>And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made five minas.’</J>
Luke 19-19 <J>And he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’</J>
Luke 19-20 <J>Then another came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in <f>ⓢ</f>a handkerchief;</J>
Luke 19-21 <J>for I was afraid of you, because you are <f>ⓣ</f>a severe man. You take <f>ⓤ</f>what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.’</J>
Luke 19-22 <J>He said to him, <f>ⓥ</f>‘I will condemn you with your own words, <f>ⓦ</f>you wicked servant! You knew that I was <f>ⓧ</f>a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?</J>
Luke 19-23 <J>Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?’</J>
Luke 19-24 <J>And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’</J>
Luke 19-25 <J>And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’</J>
Luke 19-26 <J>‘I tell you that <f>ⓨ</f>to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</J>
Luke 19-27 <J>But <f>ⓩ</f>as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and <f>ⓐ</f>slaughter them before me.’”</J>
Luke 19-28 <pb/>And when he had said these things, <f>ⓑ</f>he went on ahead, <f>ⓒ</f>going up to Jerusalem.
Luke 19-29 <f>ⓓ</f> When he drew near to Bethphage and <f>ⓔ</f>Bethany, at <f>ⓕ</f>the mount that is called Olivet, he sent <f>ⓖ</f>two of the disciples,
Luke 19-30 saying, <J>“Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, <f>ⓗ</f>on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.</J>
Luke 19-31 <J>If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”</J>
Luke 19-32 So those who were sent went away and found it <f>ⓘ</f>just as he had told them.
Luke 19-33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”
Luke 19-34 And they said, “The Lord has need of it.”
Luke 19-35 And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it.
Luke 19-36 And as he rode along, they <f>ⓙ</f>spread their cloaks on the road.
Luke 19-37 As he was drawing near — already on the way down the Mount of Olives — <f>ⓚ</f>the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice <f>ⓛ</f>for all the mighty works that they had seen,
Luke 19-38 saying, <f>ⓜ</f>“Blessed is <f>ⓝ</f>the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and <f>ⓞ</f>glory in the highest!”
Luke 19-39 <f>ⓟ</f> And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”
Luke 19-40 He answered, <J>“I tell you, if these were silent, <f>ⓠ</f>the very stones would cry out.”</J>
Luke 19-41 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And when he drew near and saw the city, <f>ⓢ</f>he wept over it,
Luke 19-42 saying, <J> <f>ⓣ</f>“Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now <f>ⓤ</f>they are hidden from your eyes.</J>
Luke 19-43 <J>For <f>ⓥ</f>the days will come upon you, when your enemies <f>ⓦ</f>will set up a barricade around you and <f>ⓧ</f>surround you and hem you in on every side</J>
Luke 19-44 <J><f>ⓨ</f> and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And <f>ⓩ</f>they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know <f>ⓐ</f>the time of your <f>ⓑ</f>visitation.”</J>
Luke 19-45 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,
Luke 19-46 saying to them, <J>“It is written, <f>ⓓ</f>‘My house shall be a house of prayer,’ but <f>ⓔ</f>you have made it a den of robbers.”</J>
Luke 19-47 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And he was teaching daily in the temple. <f>ⓖ</f>The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him,
Luke 19-48 but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were hanging on his words.
