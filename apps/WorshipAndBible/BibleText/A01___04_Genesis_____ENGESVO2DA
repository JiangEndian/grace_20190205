Genesis 4-1 <pb/>Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gotten <f>[1]</f> a man with the help of the LORD.”
Genesis 4-2 And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a worker of the ground.
Genesis 4-3 In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of <f>ⓐ</f>the fruit of the ground,
Genesis 4-4 and Abel also brought of <f>ⓑ</f>the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>had regard for Abel and his offering,
Genesis 4-5 but <f>ⓓ</f>for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell.
Genesis 4-6 The LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen?
Genesis 4-7 <f>ⓔ</f> If you do well, will you not be accepted? <f>[2]</f> And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. <f>ⓕ</f>Its desire is contrary to <f>[3]</f> you, but you must rule over it.”
Genesis 4-8 <pb/>Cain spoke to Abel his brother. <f>[4]</f> And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and <f>ⓖ</f>killed him.
Genesis 4-9 Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” He said, <f>ⓗ</f>“I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?”
Genesis 4-10 And the LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood <f>ⓘ</f>is crying to me from the ground.
Genesis 4-11 And now <f>ⓙ</f>you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
Genesis 4-12 When you work the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
Genesis 4-13 Cain said to the LORD, “My <f>ⓚ</f>punishment is greater than I can bear. <f>[5]</f>
Genesis 4-14 Behold, <f>ⓛ</f>you have driven me today away from the ground, and <f>ⓜ</f>from your face I shall be hidden. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, <f>ⓝ</f>and whoever finds me will kill me.”
Genesis 4-15 Then the LORD said to him, “Not so! If anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him <f>ⓞ</f>sevenfold.” And the LORD <f>ⓟ</f>put a mark on Cain, lest any who found him should attack him.
Genesis 4-16 Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, <f>[6]</f> east of Eden.
Genesis 4-17 <pb/>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. When he built a city, he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
Genesis 4-18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.
Genesis 4-19 And Lamech took two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
Genesis 4-20 Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
Genesis 4-21 His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
Genesis 4-22 Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
Genesis 4-23 <pb/>Lamech said to his wives: <pb/><t>“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; </t><t>you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: </t><t>I have killed a man for wounding me, </t><t>a young man for striking me.</t>
Genesis 4-24 <t><f>ⓠ</f> If Cain's revenge is sevenfold, </t><t>then Lamech's is seventy-sevenfold.” </t>
Genesis 4-25 <pb/>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, “God has appointed <f>[7]</f> for me another offspring instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”
Genesis 4-26 To <f>ⓡ</f>Seth also a son was born, and he called his name <f>ⓢ</f>Enosh. At that time people began <f>ⓣ</f>to call upon the name of the LORD.
