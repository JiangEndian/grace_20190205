2 Corinthians 2-1 <pb/>For I made up my mind <f>ⓐ</f>not to make another painful visit to you.
2 Corinthians 2-2 For <f>ⓑ</f>if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?
2 Corinthians 2-3 And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, <f>ⓒ</f>for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.
2 Corinthians 2-4 For <f>ⓓ</f>I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.
2 Corinthians 2-5 <pb/>Now <f>ⓔ</f>if anyone has caused pain, <f>ⓕ</f>he has caused it not to me, but <f>ⓖ</f>in some measure — not to put it too severely — to all of you.
2 Corinthians 2-6 For such a one, <f>ⓗ</f>this punishment by the majority is enough,
2 Corinthians 2-7 so <f>ⓘ</f>you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
2 Corinthians 2-8 So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.
2 Corinthians 2-9 For this is why I wrote, that I might <f>ⓙ</f>test you and know <f>ⓚ</f>whether you are obedient in everything.
2 Corinthians 2-10 Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,
2 Corinthians 2-11 so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for <f>ⓛ</f>we are not ignorant of his designs.
2 Corinthians 2-12 <pb/>When <f>ⓜ</f>I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though <f>ⓝ</f>a door was opened for me in the Lord,
2 Corinthians 2-13 my spirit <f>ⓞ</f>was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.
2 Corinthians 2-14 <pb/>But <f>ⓟ</f>thanks be to God, who in Christ always <f>ⓠ</f>leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads <f>ⓡ</f>the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.
2 Corinthians 2-15 For we are the aroma of Christ to God among <f>ⓢ</f>those who are being saved and among <f>ⓣ</f>those who are perishing,
2 Corinthians 2-16 <f>ⓤ</f> to one a fragrance from death to death, <f>ⓥ</f>to the other a fragrance from life to life. <f>ⓦ</f>Who is sufficient for these things?
2 Corinthians 2-17 For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.
