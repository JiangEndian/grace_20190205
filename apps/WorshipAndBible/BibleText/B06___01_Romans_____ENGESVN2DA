Romans 1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>a servant <f>[1]</f> of Christ Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>called to be an apostle, <f>ⓒ</f>set apart for the gospel of God,
Romans 1-2 which <f>ⓓ</f>he promised beforehand <f>ⓔ</f>through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
Romans 1-3 concerning his Son, <f>ⓕ</f>who was descended from David <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>according to the flesh
Romans 1-4 and <f>ⓗ</f>was declared to be the Son of God <f>ⓘ</f>in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,
Romans 1-5 through whom <f>ⓙ</f>we have received grace and <f>ⓚ</f>apostleship <f>ⓛ</f>to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name <f>ⓜ</f>among all the nations,
Romans 1-6 including you who are <f>ⓝ</f>called to belong to Jesus Christ,
Romans 1-7 <pb/>To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: <pb/><f>ⓞ</f>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans 1-8 <pb/>First, <f>ⓟ</f>I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, <f>ⓠ</f>because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.
Romans 1-9 <f>ⓡ</f> For God is my witness, <f>ⓢ</f>whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, <f>ⓣ</f>that without ceasing I mention you
Romans 1-10 always in my prayers, asking that somehow <f>ⓤ</f>by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.
Romans 1-11 For <f>ⓥ</f>I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you —
Romans 1-12 that is, that we may be mutually encouraged <f>ⓦ</f>by each other's faith, both yours and mine.
Romans 1-13 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, <f>[3]</f> that <f>ⓧ</f>I have often intended to come to you (but <f>ⓨ</f>thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some <f>ⓩ</f>harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.
Romans 1-14 <f>ⓐ</f> I am under obligation both to Greeks and to <f>ⓑ</f>barbarians, <f>[4]</f> both to the wise and to the foolish.
Romans 1-15 So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
Romans 1-16 <pb/>For <f>ⓒ</f>I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is <f>ⓓ</f>the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew <f>ⓔ</f>first and also to <f>ⓕ</f>the Greek.
Romans 1-17 For in it <f>ⓖ</f>the righteousness of God is revealed <f>ⓗ</f>from faith for faith, <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.” <f>[6]</f>
Romans 1-18 <pb/>For <f>ⓙ</f>the wrath of God <f>ⓚ</f>is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
Romans 1-19 For what can be <f>ⓛ</f>known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
Romans 1-20 For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, <f>ⓜ</f>have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, <f>[7]</f> in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.
Romans 1-21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they <f>ⓝ</f>became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
Romans 1-22 <f>ⓞ</f> Claiming to be wise, they became fools,
Romans 1-23 and <f>ⓟ</f>exchanged the glory of <f>ⓠ</f>the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.
Romans 1-24 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓡ</f>God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to <f>ⓢ</f>the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,
Romans 1-25 because they exchanged the truth about God for <f>ⓣ</f>a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, <f>ⓤ</f>who is blessed forever! Amen.
Romans 1-26 <pb/>For this reason <f>ⓥ</f>God gave them up to <f>ⓦ</f>dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;
Romans 1-27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, <f>ⓧ</f>men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
Romans 1-28 <pb/>And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, <f>ⓨ</f>God gave them up to <f>ⓩ</f>a debased mind to do <f>ⓐ</f>what ought not to be done.
Romans 1-29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,
Romans 1-30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
Romans 1-31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
Romans 1-32 Though they know <f>ⓑ</f>God's righteous decree that those who practice such things <f>ⓒ</f>deserve to die, they not only do them but <f>ⓓ</f>give approval to those who practice them.
