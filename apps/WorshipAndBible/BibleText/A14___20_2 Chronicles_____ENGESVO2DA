2 Chronicles 20-22 <pb/>And when they began to sing and praise, the LORD set <f>ⓘ</f>an ambush against the men of <f>ⓙ</f>Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah, so that they were routed.

2 Chronicles 20-29 <f>ⓜ</f> And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.

2 Chronicles 20-34 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of <f>ⓡ</f>Jehu the son of Hanani, <f>ⓢ</f>which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
