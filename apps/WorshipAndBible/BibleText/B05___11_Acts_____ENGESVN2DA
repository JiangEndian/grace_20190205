Acts 11-1 <pb/>Now the apostles and <f>ⓐ</f>the brothers <f>[1]</f> who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
Acts 11-2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, <f>ⓑ</f>the circumcision party <f>[2]</f> criticized him, saying,
Acts 11-3 <f>ⓒ</f> “You went to uncircumcised men and <f>ⓓ</f>ate with them.”
Acts 11-4 But Peter began and explained it to them in order:
Acts 11-5 <f>ⓔ</f> “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.
Acts 11-6 Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air.
Acts 11-7 And I heard a voice saying to me, <J>‘Rise, Peter; kill and eat.’</J>
Acts 11-8 But I said, ‘By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’
Acts 11-9 But the voice answered a second time from heaven, <J>‘What God has made clean, do not call common.’</J>
Acts 11-10 This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.
Acts 11-11 And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea.
Acts 11-12 And the Spirit told me to go with them, <f>ⓕ</f>making no distinction. <f>ⓖ</f>These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.
Acts 11-13 And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter;
Acts 11-14 <f>ⓗ</f> he will declare to you a message by which <f>ⓘ</f>you will be saved, you and all your household.’
Acts 11-15 As I began to speak, <f>ⓙ</f>the Holy Spirit fell on them <f>ⓚ</f>just as on us at the beginning.
Acts 11-16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</J>
Acts 11-17 If then <f>ⓜ</f>God gave <f>ⓝ</f>the same gift to them as he gave to us <f>ⓞ</f>when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, <f>ⓟ</f>who was I <f>ⓠ</f>that I could stand in God's way?”
Acts 11-18 When they heard these things they fell silent. And they <f>ⓡ</f>glorified God, saying, <f>ⓢ</f>“Then to the Gentiles also God has <f>ⓣ</f>granted <f>ⓤ</f>repentance that leads to life.”
Acts 11-19 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.
Acts 11-20 But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists <f>[3]</f> also, <f>ⓦ</f>preaching the Lord Jesus.
Acts 11-21 And <f>ⓧ</f>the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed <f>ⓨ</f>turned to the Lord.
Acts 11-22 The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
Acts 11-23 When he came and saw <f>ⓩ</f>the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord <f>ⓐ</f>with steadfast purpose,
Acts 11-24 for he was a good man, <f>ⓑ</f>full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people <f>ⓒ</f>were added to the Lord.
Acts 11-25 So Barnabas went to <f>ⓓ</f>Tarsus to look for Saul,
Acts 11-26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called <f>ⓔ</f>Christians.
Acts 11-27 <pb/>Now in these days <f>ⓕ</f>prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Acts 11-28 And one of them named <f>ⓖ</f>Agabus stood up and foretold <f>ⓗ</f>by the Spirit that there would be a great <f>ⓘ</f>famine over all the world (this took place in the days of <f>ⓙ</f>Claudius).
Acts 11-29 So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, <f>ⓚ</f>to send relief to <f>ⓛ</f>the brothers <f>[4]</f> living in Judea.
Acts 11-30 <f>ⓜ</f> And they did so, sending it to <f>ⓝ</f>the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
