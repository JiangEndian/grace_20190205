Deuteronomy 20-12 But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it.
Deuteronomy 20-13 And when the LORD your God gives it into your hand, <f>ⓘ</f>you shall put all its males to the sword,

Deuteronomy 20-17 but <f>ⓝ</f>you shall devote them to complete destruction, <f>[1]</f> the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the LORD your God has commanded,
Deuteronomy 20-18 that <f>ⓞ</f>they may not teach you to do according to all their abominable practices that they have done for their gods, and so you <f>ⓟ</f>sin against the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy 20-19 <pb/>“When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to take it, <f>ⓠ</f>you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them.

Deuteronomy 20-20 Only the trees that you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, that you may build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.
