Matthew 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In those days <f>ⓑ</f>John the Baptist came preaching in <f>ⓒ</f>the wilderness of Judea,
Matthew 3-2 <f>ⓓ</f> “Repent, for <f>ⓔ</f>the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” <f>[1]</f>
Matthew 3-3 For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness: </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>‘Prepare <f>[2]</f> the way of the Lord; </t><t>make his paths straight.’” </t>
Matthew 3-4 <pb/>Now John wore <f>ⓗ</f>a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was <f>ⓘ</f>locusts and <f>ⓙ</f>wild honey.
Matthew 3-5 Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,
Matthew 3-6 and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, <f>ⓚ</f>confessing their sins.
Matthew 3-7 <pb/>But when he saw many of <f>ⓛ</f>the Pharisees and <f>ⓜ</f>Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, <f>ⓝ</f>“You brood of <f>ⓞ</f>vipers! Who warned you to flee from <f>ⓟ</f>the wrath to come?
Matthew 3-8 Bear fruit <f>ⓠ</f>in keeping with repentance.
Matthew 3-9 And do not presume to say to yourselves, <f>ⓡ</f>‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from <f>ⓢ</f>these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
Matthew 3-10 Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. <f>ⓣ</f>Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Matthew 3-11 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> “I baptize you with water <f>ⓥ</f>for repentance, but <f>ⓦ</f>he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you <f>ⓧ</f>with the Holy Spirit and <f>ⓨ</f>fire.
Matthew 3-12 His <f>ⓩ</f>winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and <f>ⓐ</f>gather his wheat into the barn, <f>ⓑ</f>but the chaff he will burn with <f>ⓒ</f>unquenchable fire.”
Matthew 3-13 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Then Jesus came <f>ⓔ</f>from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
Matthew 3-14 <f>ⓕ</f> John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”
Matthew 3-15 But Jesus answered him, <J>“Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.”</J> Then he consented.
Matthew 3-16 And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, <f>ⓖ</f>the heavens were opened to him, <f>[3]</f> and he <f>ⓗ</f>saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;
Matthew 3-17 and behold, <f>ⓘ</f>a voice from heaven said, <f>ⓙ</f>“This is my beloved Son, <f>[4]</f> with whom I am well pleased.”
