Zephaniah 1-3 <t>“I will sweep away <f>ⓓ</f>man and beast; </t><t>I will sweep away the birds of the heavens </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>the fish of the sea, </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>the rubble <f>[1]</f> with the wicked. </t><t>I will <f>ⓖ</f>cut off mankind </t><t>from the face of the earth,” declares the LORD.</t>
Zephaniah 1-4 <t>“I will stretch out my hand against Judah </t><t>and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and I will cut off from this place the remnant of Baal </t><t>and the name of the idolatrous priests along with the priests,</t>
Zephaniah 1-5 <t><f>ⓘ</f> those who bow down on the roofs </t><t>to the host of the heavens, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>those who bow down and swear to the LORD </t><t>and yet swear by <f>ⓚ</f>Milcom, <f>[2]</f></t>
Zephaniah 1-6 <t><f>ⓛ</f> those who have turned back from following the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>who do not seek the LORD or inquire of him.” </t>
Zephaniah 1-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> Be silent before the Lord GOD! </t><t>For <f>ⓞ</f>the day of the LORD is near; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>the LORD has prepared a sacrifice </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>consecrated his guests.</t>
Zephaniah 1-8 <t>And on the day of the LORD's sacrifice — </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>“I will punish the officials and the king's sons </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>all who array themselves in foreign attire.</t>

Zephaniah 1-10 <pb/><t>“On that day,” declares the LORD, </t><t>“a cry will be heard from <f>ⓤ</f>the Fish Gate, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>a wail from <f>ⓦ</f>the Second Quarter, </t><t>a loud crash from the hills.</t>
Zephaniah 1-11 <t><f>ⓧ</f> Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar! </t><t>For all the traders <f>[4]</f> are no more; </t><t>all who weigh out silver are cut off.</t>
Zephaniah 1-12 <t>At that time <f>ⓨ</f>I will search Jerusalem with lamps, </t><t>and I will punish the men </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>who are complacent, <f>[5]</f> </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>those who say in their hearts, </t><t>‘The LORD will not do good, </t><t>nor will he do ill.’</t>
Zephaniah 1-13 <t>Their goods shall be <f>ⓑ</f>plundered, </t><t>and their houses laid waste. </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>Though they build houses, </t><t>they shall not inhabit them; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>though they plant vineyards, </t><t>they shall not drink wine from them.” </t>

Zephaniah 1-15 <t><f>ⓖ</f> A day of wrath is that day, </t><t>a day of distress and anguish, </t><t>a day of <f>ⓗ</f>ruin and devastation, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>a day of darkness and gloom, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>a day of clouds and thick darkness,</t>
Zephaniah 1-16 <t><f>ⓚ</f> a day of trumpet blast and battle cry </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>against the fortified cities </t><t>and against the lofty battlements. </t>
Zephaniah 1-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> I will bring distress on mankind, </t><t>so that they shall walk <f>ⓝ</f>like the blind, </t><t>because they have sinned against the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>their blood shall be poured out like dust, </t><t>and their flesh <f>ⓟ</f>like dung.</t>
Zephaniah 1-18 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Neither their silver nor their gold </t><t>shall be able to deliver them </t><t>on the day of the wrath of the LORD. </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>In the fire of his jealousy, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>all the earth shall be consumed; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>for a full and sudden end </t><t>he will make of all the inhabitants of the earth. </t>
