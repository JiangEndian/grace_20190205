Isaiah 65-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> I was ready to be sought by <f>ⓑ</f>those who did not ask for me; </t><t>I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. </t><t>I said, “Here I am, here I am,” </t><t>to a nation that was not called by <f>[1]</f> my name.</t>
Isaiah 65-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> I spread out my hands all the day </t><t>to a rebellious people, </t><t>who walk in a way that is not good, </t><t>following their own devices;</t>
Isaiah 65-3 <t>a people who provoke me </t><t>to my face continually, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>sacrificing in gardens </t><t>and making offerings on bricks;</t>
Isaiah 65-4 <t>who sit in tombs, </t><t>and spend the night in secret places; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>who eat pig's flesh, </t><t>and broth of tainted meat is in their vessels;</t>
Isaiah 65-5 <t>who say, “Keep to yourself, </t><t>do not come near me, for I am too holy for you.” </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>These are a smoke in my nostrils, </t><t>a fire that burns all the day.</t>
Isaiah 65-6 <t>Behold, <f>ⓖ</f>it is written before me: </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>“I will not keep silent, but I will repay; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>I will indeed repay into their lap</t>
Isaiah 65-7 <t>both your iniquities <f>ⓙ</f>and your fathers' iniquities together, <pb/>says the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>because they made offerings on the mountains </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>and insulted me on the hills, </t><t>I will measure into their lap </t><t>payment for their former deeds.” <f>[2]</f> </t>
Isaiah 65-8 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>“As the new wine is found in the cluster, </t><t>and they say, ‘Do not destroy it, </t><t>for there is a blessing in it,’ </t><t>so I will do for my servants' sake, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>and not destroy them all.</t>

Isaiah 65-11 <t>But <f>ⓢ</f>you who forsake the LORD, </t><t>who forget <f>ⓣ</f>my holy mountain, </t><t>who <f>ⓤ</f>set a table for Fortune </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,</t>
Isaiah 65-12 <t>I will destine you to the sword, </t><t>and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>because, when I called, you did not answer; </t><t>when I spoke, you did not listen, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>but you did what was evil in my eyes </t><t>and chose what I did not delight in.” </t>
Isaiah 65-13 <pb/><t>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: </t><t>“Behold, <f>ⓨ</f>my servants shall eat, </t><t>but you shall be hungry; </t><t>behold, my servants shall drink, </t><t>but you shall be thirsty; </t><t>behold, my servants shall rejoice, </t><t>but you shall be put to shame;</t>
Isaiah 65-14 <t>behold, <f>ⓩ</f>my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, </t><t>but you shall cry out for pain of heart </t><t>and shall wail for breaking of spirit.</t>
Isaiah 65-15 <t>You shall leave your name to <f>ⓐ</f>my chosen <f>ⓑ</f>for a curse, </t><t>and the Lord GOD will put you to death, </t><t>but his servants <f>ⓒ</f>he will call by another name,</t>
Isaiah 65-16 <t>so that he who <f>ⓓ</f>blesses himself in the land </t><t>shall bless himself by <f>ⓔ</f>the God of truth, </t><t>and he who takes an oath in the land </t><t>shall swear by <f>ⓕ</f>the God of truth; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>because the former troubles are forgotten </t><t>and are hidden from my eyes. </t>
Isaiah 65-17 <pb/><t>“For behold, <f>ⓗ</f>I create new heavens </t><t>and a new earth, </t><t>and the former things shall not be remembered </t><t>or come into mind.</t>
Isaiah 65-18 <t>But be glad and rejoice forever </t><t>in that which I create; </t><t>for behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I create Jerusalem to be a joy, </t><t>and her people to be a gladness.</t>
Isaiah 65-19 <t><f>ⓙ</f> I will rejoice in Jerusalem </t><t>and be glad in my people; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping </t><t>and the cry of distress.</t>
Isaiah 65-20 <t>No more shall there be in it </t><t>an infant who lives but a few days, </t><t>or an old man who does not fill out his days, </t><t>for <f>ⓛ</f>the young man shall die a hundred years old, </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.</t>

Isaiah 65-22 <t><f>ⓞ</f> They shall not build and another inhabit; </t><t>they shall not plant and another eat; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, </t><t>and my chosen shall long enjoy <f>[3]</f> the work of their hands.</t>
Isaiah 65-23 <t><f>ⓠ</f> They shall not labor in vain </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>or bear children for calamity, <f>[4]</f> </t><t>for <f>ⓢ</f>they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD, </t><t>and their descendants with them.</t>
Isaiah 65-24 <t><f>ⓣ</f> Before they call I will answer; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>while they are yet speaking I will hear.</t>
Isaiah 65-25 <t><f>ⓥ</f> The wolf and the lamb shall graze together; </t><t>the lion shall eat straw like the ox, </t><t>and <f>ⓦ</f>dust shall be the serpent's food. </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>They shall not hurt or destroy </t><t>in all my holy mountain,” <pb/>says the LORD. </t>
