Philippians 3-1 <pb/>Finally, my brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>rejoice in the Lord. <f>ⓑ</f>To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.
Philippians 3-2 <pb/>Look out for <f>ⓒ</f>the dogs, look out for <f>ⓓ</f>the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh.
Philippians 3-3 For <f>ⓔ</f>we are the circumcision, <f>ⓕ</f>who worship <f>ⓖ</f>by the Spirit of God <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓗ</f>glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh —
Philippians 3-4 <f>ⓘ</f> though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:
Philippians 3-5 <f>ⓙ</f> circumcised on the eighth day, <f>ⓚ</f>of the people of Israel, <f>ⓛ</f>of the tribe of Benjamin, <f>ⓜ</f>a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, <f>ⓝ</f>a Pharisee;
Philippians 3-6 <f>ⓞ</f> as to zeal, <f>ⓟ</f>a persecutor of the church; <f>ⓠ</f>as to righteousness under the law, <f>[3]</f> blameless.
Philippians 3-7 But <f>ⓡ</f>whatever gain I had, <f>ⓢ</f>I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
Philippians 3-8 Indeed, I count everything as loss because of <f>ⓣ</f>the surpassing worth of <f>ⓤ</f>knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I <f>ⓥ</f>have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ
Philippians 3-9 and be found in him, not having <f>ⓦ</f>a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but <f>ⓧ</f>that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith —
Philippians 3-10 <f>ⓨ</f> that I may know him and <f>ⓩ</f>the power of his resurrection, and <f>ⓐ</f>may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
Philippians 3-11 that by any means possible I may <f>ⓑ</f>attain the resurrection from the dead.
Philippians 3-12 <pb/>Not that I have already <f>ⓒ</f>obtained this or <f>ⓓ</f>am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
Philippians 3-13 Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: <f>ⓔ</f>forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,
Philippians 3-14 I press on toward the goal for <f>ⓕ</f>the prize of the upward <f>ⓖ</f>call of God in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 3-15 Let those of us who are <f>ⓗ</f>mature think this way, and if in anything <f>ⓘ</f>you think otherwise, <f>ⓙ</f>God will reveal that also to you.
Philippians 3-16 Only <f>ⓚ</f>let us hold true to what we have attained.
Philippians 3-17 <pb/>Brothers, <f>ⓛ</f>join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk <f>ⓜ</f>according to the example you have in us.
Philippians 3-18 For <f>ⓝ</f>many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you <f>ⓞ</f>even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.
Philippians 3-19 <f>ⓟ</f> Their end is destruction, <f>ⓠ</f>their god is their belly, and <f>ⓡ</f>they glory in their shame, with <f>ⓢ</f>minds set on earthly things.
Philippians 3-20 But <f>ⓣ</f>our citizenship is in heaven, and <f>ⓤ</f>from it we <f>ⓥ</f>await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
Philippians 3-21 who will transform <f>ⓦ</f>our lowly body <f>ⓧ</f>to be like his glorious body, <f>ⓨ</f>by the power that enables him even <f>ⓩ</f>to subject all things to himself.
