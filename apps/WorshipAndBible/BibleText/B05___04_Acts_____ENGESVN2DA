Acts 4-7 And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, <f>ⓗ</f>“By what power or <f>ⓘ</f>by what name did you do this?”

Acts 4-10 let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that <f>ⓛ</f>by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, <f>ⓜ</f>whom God raised from the dead — by him this man is standing before you well.
Acts 4-11 <f>ⓝ</f> This Jesus <f>[1]</f> is the stone that was <f>ⓞ</f>rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. <f>[2]</f>

Acts 4-19 But Peter and John answered them, <f>ⓩ</f>“Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge,
Acts 4-20 for <f>ⓐ</f>we cannot but speak of what <f>ⓑ</f>we have seen and heard.”
Acts 4-21 And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, <f>ⓒ</f>because of the people, for all were praising God <f>ⓓ</f>for what had happened.

Acts 4-27 <pb/>for truly in this city there were gathered together against your <f>ⓙ</f>holy servant Jesus, <f>ⓚ</f>whom you anointed, both <f>ⓛ</f>Herod and <f>ⓜ</f>Pontius Pilate, along <f>ⓝ</f>with the Gentiles and <f>ⓞ</f>the peoples of Israel,
Acts 4-28 <f>ⓟ</f> to do whatever your hand and <f>ⓠ</f>your plan had predestined to take place.

Acts 4-30 while <f>ⓣ</f>you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed <f>ⓤ</f>through the name of your <f>ⓥ</f>holy servant Jesus.”
Acts 4-31 And when they had prayed, <f>ⓦ</f>the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and <f>ⓧ</f>they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and <f>ⓨ</f>continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
Acts 4-32 <pb/>Now the full number of those who believed were of <f>ⓩ</f>one heart and <f>ⓐ</f>soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but <f>ⓑ</f>they had everything in common.

Acts 4-37 sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and <f>ⓙ</f>laid it at the apostles' feet.
