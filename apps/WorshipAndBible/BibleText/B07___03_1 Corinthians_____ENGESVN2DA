1 Corinthians 3-1 <pb/>But I, brothers, <f>[1]</f> could not address you as <f>ⓐ</f>spiritual people, but as <f>ⓑ</f>people of the flesh, as <f>ⓒ</f>infants in Christ.
1 Corinthians 3-2 <f>ⓓ</f> I fed you with milk, not solid food, for <f>ⓔ</f>you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready,
1 Corinthians 3-3 for you are still of the flesh. For while there is <f>ⓕ</f>jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?
1 Corinthians 3-4 For <f>ⓖ</f>when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” <f>ⓗ</f>are you not being merely human?
1 Corinthians 3-5 <pb/>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? <f>ⓘ</f>Servants through whom you believed, <f>ⓙ</f>as the Lord assigned to each.
1 Corinthians 3-6 <f>ⓚ</f> I planted, <f>ⓛ</f>Apollos watered, <f>ⓜ</f>but God gave the growth.
1 Corinthians 3-7 So <f>ⓝ</f>neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
1 Corinthians 3-8 He who plants and he who waters are one, and each <f>ⓞ</f>will receive his wages according to his labor.
1 Corinthians 3-9 For we are <f>ⓟ</f>God's fellow workers. You are God's field, <f>ⓠ</f>God's building.
1 Corinthians 3-10 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled <f>[2]</f> master builder I laid a <f>ⓢ</f>foundation, and <f>ⓣ</f>someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it.
1 Corinthians 3-11 For no one can lay a <f>ⓤ</f>foundation other <f>ⓥ</f>than that which is laid, <f>ⓦ</f>which is Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians 3-12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw —
1 Corinthians 3-13 <f>ⓧ</f> each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed <f>ⓨ</f>by fire, and <f>ⓩ</f>the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
1 Corinthians 3-14 If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, <f>ⓐ</f>he will receive a reward.
1 Corinthians 3-15 If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, <f>ⓑ</f>but only as through fire.
1 Corinthians 3-16 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> Do you not know that you <f>[3]</f> are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?
1 Corinthians 3-17 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For <f>ⓓ</f>God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.
1 Corinthians 3-18 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Let no one deceive himself. <f>ⓕ</f>If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
1 Corinthians 3-19 For <f>ⓖ</f>the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, <f>ⓗ</f>“He catches the wise in their craftiness,”
1 Corinthians 3-20 and again, <f>ⓘ</f>“The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”
1 Corinthians 3-21 So <f>ⓙ</f>let no one boast in men. For <f>ⓚ</f>all things are yours,
1 Corinthians 3-22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future — all are yours,
1 Corinthians 3-23 and <f>ⓛ</f>you are Christ's, and <f>ⓜ</f>Christ is God's.
