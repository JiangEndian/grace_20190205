Acts 1-1 <pb/>In the first book, O <f>ⓐ</f>Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began <f>ⓑ</f>to do and teach,
Acts 1-2 until the day when <f>ⓒ</f>he was taken up, after he <f>ⓓ</f>had given commands <f>ⓔ</f>through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
Acts 1-3 <f>ⓕ</f> He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
Acts 1-4 <pb/>And while staying <f>[1]</f> with them <f>ⓖ</f>he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, <J>“you heard from me;</J>
Acts 1-5 <J>for <f>ⓗ</f>John baptized with water, <f>ⓘ</f>but you will be baptized <f>ⓙ</f>with <f>[2]</f> the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”</J>
Acts 1-6 <pb/>So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, <f>ⓚ</f>will you at this time <f>ⓛ</f>restore the kingdom to Israel?”
Acts 1-7 He said to them, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“It is not for you to know <f>ⓝ</f>times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.</J>
Acts 1-8 <J>But you will receive <f>ⓞ</f>power <f>ⓟ</f>when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and <f>ⓠ</f>you will be <f>ⓡ</f>my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and <f>ⓢ</f>Samaria, and <f>ⓣ</f>to the end of the earth.”</J>
Acts 1-9 And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, <f>ⓤ</f>he was lifted up, and <f>ⓥ</f>a cloud took him out of their sight.
Acts 1-10 And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, <f>ⓦ</f>two <f>ⓧ</f>men stood by them in <f>ⓨ</f>white robes,
Acts 1-11 and said, <f>ⓩ</f>“Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, <f>ⓐ</f>will <f>ⓑ</f>come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”
Acts 1-12 <pb/>Then <f>ⓒ</f>they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
Acts 1-13 And when they had entered, they went up to <f>ⓓ</f>the upper room, where they were staying, <f>ⓔ</f>Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon <f>ⓕ</f>the Zealot and Judas the son of James.
Acts 1-14 All these <f>ⓖ</f>with one accord <f>ⓗ</f>were devoting themselves to prayer, together with <f>ⓘ</f>the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and <f>ⓙ</f>his brothers. <f>[3]</f>
Acts 1-15 <pb/>In those days Peter stood up among <f>ⓚ</f>the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said,
Acts 1-16 “Brothers, <f>ⓛ</f>the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, <f>ⓜ</f>who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
Acts 1-17 For <f>ⓝ</f>he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in <f>ⓞ</f>this ministry.”
Acts 1-18 (Now this man <f>ⓟ</f>acquired a field with <f>ⓠ</f>the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong <f>[4]</f> he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.
Acts 1-19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called <f>ⓡ</f>in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
Acts 1-20 “For it is written in the Book of Psalms, <pb/><t><f>ⓢ</f>“‘May his camp become desolate, </t><t>and let there be no one to dwell in it’; </t> <pb/>and <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“‘Let another take his office.’ </t>
Acts 1-21 <pb/>So one of the men who have accompanied us during <f>ⓤ</f>all the time that the Lord Jesus <f>ⓥ</f>went in and out among us,
Acts 1-22 <f>ⓦ</f> beginning from the baptism of John until the day when <f>ⓧ</f>he was taken up from us — one of these men must become with us <f>ⓨ</f>a witness to his resurrection.”
Acts 1-23 And they put forward two, Joseph called <f>ⓩ</f>Barsabbas, who was also called <f>ⓐ</f>Justus, and <f>ⓑ</f>Matthias.
Acts 1-24 And <f>ⓒ</f>they prayed and said, “You, Lord, <f>ⓓ</f>who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen
Acts 1-25 to take the place in <f>ⓔ</f>this ministry and <f>ⓕ</f>apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.”
Acts 1-26 And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
