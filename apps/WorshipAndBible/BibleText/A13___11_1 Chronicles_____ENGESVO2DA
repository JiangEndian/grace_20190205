1 Chronicles 11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
1 Chronicles 11-2 In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD your God said to you, <f>ⓑ</f>‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’”
1 Chronicles 11-3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel, <f>ⓒ</f>according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
1 Chronicles 11-4 <pb/>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, <f>ⓓ</f>that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites were, <f>ⓔ</f>the inhabitants of the land.
1 Chronicles 11-5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
1 Chronicles 11-6 David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first <f>ⓕ</f>shall be chief and commander.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
1 Chronicles 11-7 And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
1 Chronicles 11-8 And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
1 Chronicles 11-9 And David <f>ⓖ</f>became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.
1 Chronicles 11-10 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Now these are the chiefs of David's mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, <f>ⓘ</f>according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
1 Chronicles 11-11 This is an account of David's mighty men: <f>ⓙ</f>Jashobeam, a <f>ⓚ</f>Hachmonite, was <f>ⓛ</f>chief of the three. <f>[1]</f> He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.
1 Chronicles 11-12 <pb/>And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of <f>ⓜ</f>Dodo, the Ahohite.
1 Chronicles 11-13 He was with David at Pas-dammim <f>ⓝ</f>when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.
1 Chronicles 11-14 But he took his <f>[2]</f> stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the LORD saved them by a great victory.
1 Chronicles 11-15 <pb/>Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the <f>ⓞ</f>Valley of Rephaim.
1 Chronicles 11-16 David was then in the stronghold, and the <f>ⓟ</f>garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
1 Chronicles 11-17 And David said longingly, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!”
1 Chronicles 11-18 Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the LORD
1 Chronicles 11-19 and said, “Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
1 Chronicles 11-20 <pb/>Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty. <f>[3]</f> And he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three.
1 Chronicles 11-21 He was the most renowned <f>[4]</f> of the thirty <f>[5]</f> and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
1 Chronicles 11-22 <pb/>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man <f>[6]</f> of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
1 Chronicles 11-23 And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits <f>[7]</f> tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear <f>ⓠ</f>like a weaver's beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
1 Chronicles 11-24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and won a name beside the three mighty men.
1 Chronicles 11-25 He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
