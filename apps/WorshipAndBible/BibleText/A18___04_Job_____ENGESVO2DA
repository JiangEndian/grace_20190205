Job 4-1 <pb/>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job 4-2 <pb/><t>“If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? </t><t>Yet who can keep from speaking?</t>
Job 4-3 <t>Behold, you have instructed many, </t><t>and you have <f>ⓐ</f>strengthened the weak hands.</t>
Job 4-4 <t>Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, </t><t>and you have <f>ⓑ</f>made firm the feeble knees.</t>
Job 4-5 <t>But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; </t><t>it touches you, and you are dismayed.</t>
Job 4-6 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Is not your fear of God <f>[1]</f> your <f>ⓓ</f>confidence, </t><t>and the integrity of your ways your hope? </t>
Job 4-7 <pb/><t>“Remember: <f>ⓔ</f>who that was innocent ever perished? </t><t>Or where were the upright cut off?</t>
Job 4-8 <t>As I have seen, those who <f>ⓕ</f>plow iniquity </t><t>and sow trouble reap the same.</t>
Job 4-9 <t>By <f>ⓖ</f>the breath of God they perish, </t><t>and by <f>ⓗ</f>the blast of his anger they are consumed.</t>
Job 4-10 <t>The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>the teeth of the young lions are broken.</t>
Job 4-11 <t>The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, </t><t>and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. </t>
Job 4-12 <pb/><t>“Now a word was brought to me stealthily; </t><t>my ear received <f>ⓙ</f>the whisper of it.</t>
Job 4-13 <t>Amid <f>ⓚ</f>thoughts from <f>ⓛ</f>visions of the night, </t><t>when <f>ⓜ</f>deep sleep falls on men,</t>
Job 4-14 <t>dread came upon me, and trembling, </t><t>which made all my bones shake.</t>
Job 4-15 <t>A spirit glided past my face; </t><t>the hair of my flesh stood up.</t>
Job 4-16 <t>It stood still, </t><t>but I could not discern its appearance. </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>A form was before my eyes; </t><t>there was silence, then I heard <f>ⓞ</f>a voice:</t>
Job 4-17 <t><f>ⓟ</f> ‘Can mortal man be in the right before <f>[2]</f> God? </t><t>Can a man be pure before his Maker?</t>
Job 4-18 <t>Even in his servants <f>ⓠ</f>he puts no trust, </t><t>and his angels he charges with error;</t>
Job 4-19 <t>how much more those who dwell in houses of <f>ⓡ</f>clay, </t><t>whose foundation is in <f>ⓢ</f>the dust, </t><t>who are crushed like <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓣ</f>the moth.</t>
Job 4-20 <t>Between <f>ⓤ</f>morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; </t><t>they perish forever <f>ⓥ</f>without anyone regarding it.</t>
Job 4-21 <t>Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>do they not die, and that without wisdom?’ </t>
