Micah 4-1 <pb/><t>It shall come to pass <f>ⓐ</f>in the latter days </t><t>that the mountain of the house of the LORD </t><t>shall be established as the highest of the mountains, </t><t>and it shall be lifted up above the hills; </t><t>and peoples shall flow to it,</t>
Micah 4-2 <t>and many nations shall come, and say: </t><t>“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, </t><t>to the house of the God of Jacob, </t><t>that he may teach us his ways </t><t>and that we may walk in his paths.” </t><t>For out of Zion shall go forth the law, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</t>
Micah 4-3 <t>He shall judge between many peoples, </t><t>and shall decide disputes for strong nations far away; </t><t>and they shall <f>ⓑ</f>beat their swords into plowshares, </t><t>and their spears into pruning hooks; </t><t>nation shall not lift up sword against nation, </t><t>neither shall they learn war anymore;</t>
Micah 4-4 <t><f>ⓒ</f> but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>and no one shall make them afraid, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>for the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.</t>
Micah 4-5 <t>For <f>ⓕ</f>all the peoples walk </t><t>each in the name of its god, </t><t>but <f>ⓖ</f>we will walk in the name of the LORD our God </t><t>forever and ever. </t>
Micah 4-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> In that day, declares the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>I will assemble the <f>ⓙ</f>lame </t><t>and gather those who have been driven away </t><t>and those whom I have afflicted;</t>
Micah 4-7 <t>and the lame I will make <f>ⓚ</f>the remnant, </t><t>and those who were cast off, a strong nation; </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>the LORD will reign over them <f>ⓜ</f>in Mount Zion </t><t>from this time forth and forevermore. </t>
Micah 4-8 <pb/><t>And you, O tower of the flock, </t><t>hill of the daughter of Zion, </t><t>to you shall it come, </t><t>the former dominion shall come, </t><t>kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem. </t>
Micah 4-9 <pb/><t>Now why do you cry aloud? </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>Is there no king in you? </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Has your counselor perished, </t><t>that <f>ⓟ</f>pain seized you like a woman in labor?</t>
Micah 4-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Writhe and groan, <f>[2]</f> O daughter of Zion, </t><t>like a woman in labor, </t><t>for <f>ⓡ</f>now you shall go out from the city </t><t>and dwell in the open country; </t><t>you <f>ⓢ</f>shall go to Babylon. </t><t>There you shall be rescued; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>there the LORD will redeem you </t><t>from the hand of your enemies. </t>
Micah 4-11 <pb/><t>Now <f>ⓤ</f>many nations </t><t>are assembled against you, </t><t>saying, “Let her be defiled, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>let our eyes gaze upon Zion.”</t>
Micah 4-12 <t>But <f>ⓦ</f>they do not know </t><t>the thoughts of the LORD; </t><t>they do not understand his plan, </t><t>that <f>ⓧ</f>he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.</t>
Micah 4-13 <t>Arise and thresh, </t><t>O daughter of Zion, </t><t>for I will make your horn iron, </t><t>and I will make your hoofs bronze; </t><t>you shall beat in pieces many peoples; </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>shall devote <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>their gain to the LORD, </t><t>their wealth to <f>ⓐ</f>the Lord of the whole earth. </t>
