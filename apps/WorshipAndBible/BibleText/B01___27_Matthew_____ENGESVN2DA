Matthew 27-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people <f>ⓑ</f>took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
Matthew 27-2 And they bound him and <f>ⓒ</f>led him away and <f>ⓓ</f>delivered him over to <f>ⓔ</f>Pilate the governor.
Matthew 27-3 <pb/>Then when <f>ⓕ</f>Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus <f>[1]</f> was condemned, <f>ⓖ</f>he changed his mind and brought back <f>ⓗ</f>the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
Matthew 27-4 saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? <f>ⓘ</f>See to it yourself.”
Matthew 27-5 And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, <f>ⓙ</f>he departed, and he went and hanged himself.
Matthew 27-6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into <f>ⓚ</f>the treasury, since it is blood money.”
Matthew 27-7 So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers.
Matthew 27-8 Therefore <f>ⓛ</f>that field has been called the Field of Blood <f>ⓜ</f>to this day.
Matthew 27-9 <f>ⓝ</f> Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, <f>ⓞ</f>“And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,
Matthew 27-10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.”
Matthew 27-11 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you <f>ⓠ</f>the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, <J> <f>ⓡ</f>“You have said so.”</J>
Matthew 27-12 <f>ⓢ</f> But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.
Matthew 27-13 Then Pilate said to him, <f>ⓣ</f>“Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?”
Matthew 27-14 But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
Matthew 27-15 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.
Matthew 27-16 And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
Matthew 27-17 So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or <f>ⓥ</f>Jesus who is called Christ?”
Matthew 27-18 For he knew that it was out <f>ⓦ</f>of envy that they had delivered him up.
Matthew 27-19 Besides, while he was sitting on <f>ⓧ</f>the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with <f>ⓨ</f>that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today <f>ⓩ</f>in a dream.”
Matthew 27-20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to <f>ⓐ</f>ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
Matthew 27-21 The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.”
Matthew 27-22 Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” <f>ⓑ</f>They all said, “Let him be crucified!”
Matthew 27-23 And he said, “Why? <f>ⓒ</f>What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”
Matthew 27-24 <pb/>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that <f>ⓓ</f>a riot was beginning, he took water and <f>ⓔ</f>washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of <f>ⓕ</f>this man's blood; <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>see to it yourselves.”
Matthew 27-25 And all the people answered, <f>ⓗ</f>“His blood be on us and <f>ⓘ</f>on our children!”
Matthew 27-26 Then he released for them Barabbas, and having <f>ⓙ</f>scourged <f>[3]</f> Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.
Matthew 27-27 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the <f>ⓛ</f>governor's headquarters, <f>[4]</f> and they gathered the whole <f>ⓜ</f>battalion <f>[5]</f> before him.
Matthew 27-28 And they stripped him and put <f>ⓝ</f>a scarlet robe on him,
Matthew 27-29 and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they <f>ⓞ</f>mocked him, saying, “Hail, <f>ⓟ</f>King of the Jews!”
Matthew 27-30 And <f>ⓠ</f>they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.
Matthew 27-31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and <f>ⓡ</f>led him away to crucify him.
Matthew 27-32 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> <f>ⓣ</f>As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to <f>ⓤ</f>carry his cross.
Matthew 27-33 <f>ⓥ</f> And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),
Matthew 27-34 <f>ⓦ</f> they offered him wine to drink, mixed with <f>ⓧ</f>gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.
Matthew 27-35 And when they had crucified him, <f>ⓨ</f>they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
Matthew 27-36 Then they sat down and <f>ⓩ</f>kept watch over him there.
Matthew 27-37 And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, <f>ⓐ</f>the King of the Jews.”
Matthew 27-38 Then two <f>ⓑ</f>robbers were crucified with him, <f>ⓒ</f>one on the right and one on the left.
Matthew 27-39 And <f>ⓓ</f>those who passed by <f>ⓔ</f>derided him, <f>ⓕ</f>wagging their heads
Matthew 27-40 and saying, <f>ⓖ</f>“You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! <f>ⓗ</f>If you are <f>ⓘ</f>the Son of God, come down from the cross.”
Matthew 27-41 So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
Matthew 27-42 <f>ⓙ</f> “He saved others; <f>ⓚ</f>he cannot save himself. <f>ⓛ</f>He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
Matthew 27-43 <f>ⓜ</f> He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”
Matthew 27-44 <f>ⓝ</f> And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
Matthew 27-45 <pb/>Now from the sixth hour <f>[6]</f> there was darkness over all the land <f>[7]</f> until the ninth hour. <f>[8]</f>
Matthew 27-46 And about the ninth hour Jesus <f>ⓞ</f>cried out with a loud voice, saying, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”</J> that is, <J>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</J>
Matthew 27-47 And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
Matthew 27-48 And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with <f>ⓠ</f>sour wine, and put it on a reed and <f>ⓡ</f>gave it to him to drink.
Matthew 27-49 But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”
Matthew 27-50 And Jesus <f>ⓢ</f>cried out again with a loud voice and <f>ⓣ</f>yielded up his spirit.
Matthew 27-51 <pb/>And behold, <f>ⓤ</f>the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And <f>ⓥ</f>the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
Matthew 27-52 The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of <f>ⓦ</f>the saints <f>ⓧ</f>who had fallen asleep were raised,
Matthew 27-53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into <f>ⓨ</f>the holy city and appeared to many.
Matthew 27-54 <f>ⓩ</f> When the centurion and those who were with him, <f>ⓐ</f>keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, <f>ⓑ</f>“Truly this was the Son <f>[9]</f> of God!”
Matthew 27-55 <pb/>There were also <f>ⓒ</f>many women there, looking on <f>ⓓ</f>from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, <f>ⓔ</f>ministering to him,
Matthew 27-56 among whom were <f>ⓕ</f>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and <f>ⓖ</f>the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
Matthew 27-57 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus.
Matthew 27-58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
Matthew 27-59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud
Matthew 27-60 and <f>ⓘ</f>laid it in his own new tomb, <f>ⓙ</f>which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled <f>ⓚ</f>a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
Matthew 27-61 Mary Magdalene and <f>ⓛ</f>the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.
Matthew 27-62 <pb/>The next day, that is, after the day of <f>ⓜ</f>Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
Matthew 27-63 and said, “Sir, we remember how <f>ⓝ</f>that impostor said, while he was still alive, <f>ⓞ</f>‘After three days I will rise.’
Matthew 27-64 Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, <f>ⓟ</f>lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.”
Matthew 27-65 Pilate said to them, “You have <f>ⓠ</f>a guard <f>[10]</f> of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.”
Matthew 27-66 So they went and made the tomb secure by <f>ⓡ</f>sealing the stone and setting a guard.
