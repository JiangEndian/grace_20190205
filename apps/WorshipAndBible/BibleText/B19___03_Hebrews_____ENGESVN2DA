Hebrews 3-1 <pb/>Therefore, holy brothers, <f>[1]</f> you who share in <f>ⓐ</f>a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>the apostle and high priest of our confession,
Hebrews 3-2 who was faithful to him who appointed him, <f>ⓒ</f>just as Moses also was faithful in all God's <f>[2]</f> house.
Hebrews 3-3 For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses — as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
Hebrews 3-4 (For every house is built by someone, but <f>ⓓ</f>the builder of all things is God.)
Hebrews 3-5 <f>ⓔ</f> Now Moses was faithful in all God's house <f>ⓕ</f>as a servant, <f>ⓖ</f>to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,
Hebrews 3-6 but Christ is faithful over God's house as <f>ⓗ</f>a son. And <f>ⓘ</f>we are his house, if indeed we <f>ⓙ</f>hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope. <f>[3]</f>
Hebrews 3-7 <pb/>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“Today, if you hear his voice,</t>
Hebrews 3-8 <t>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, </t><t>on the day of testing in the wilderness,</t>
Hebrews 3-9 <t>where your fathers put me to the test </t><t>and saw my works for <f>ⓛ</f>forty years.</t>
Hebrews 3-10 <t>Therefore I was provoked with that generation, </t><t>and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart; </t><t>they have not known my ways.’</t>
Hebrews 3-11 <t><f>ⓜ</f> As I swore in my wrath, </t><t>‘They shall not enter my rest.’” </t>
Hebrews 3-12 <pb/>Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from <f>ⓝ</f>the living God.
Hebrews 3-13 But <f>ⓞ</f>exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by <f>ⓟ</f>the deceitfulness of sin.
Hebrews 3-14 For we have come to share in Christ, <f>ⓠ</f>if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.
Hebrews 3-15 As it is said, <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f>“Today, if you hear his voice, </t><t>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.” </t>
Hebrews 3-16 <pb/>For <f>ⓢ</f>who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not <f>ⓣ</f>all those who left Egypt led by Moses?
Hebrews 3-17 And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, <f>ⓤ</f>whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews 3-18 And to whom did he swear that <f>ⓥ</f>they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
Hebrews 3-19 So we see that <f>ⓦ</f>they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
