John 16-1 <pb/><J>“I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away.</J>
John 16-2 <J><f>ⓐ</f> They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, <f>ⓑ</f>the hour is coming when <f>ⓒ</f>whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.</J>
John 16-3 <J>And they will do these things <f>ⓓ</f>because they have not known the Father, nor me.</J>
John 16-4 <J>But <f>ⓔ</f>I have said these things to you, that when <f>ⓕ</f>their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you. <pb/><e>The Work of the Holy Spirit</e> </pb></J> <pb/><J>“I did not say these things to you from the beginning, <f>ⓖ</f>because I was with you.</J>
John 16-5 <J>But now <f>ⓗ</f>I am going to him who sent me, and <f>ⓘ</f>none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’</J>
John 16-6 <J>But because I have said these things to you, <f>ⓙ</f>sorrow has filled your heart.</J>
John 16-7 <J>Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for <f>ⓚ</f>if I do not go away, <f>ⓛ</f>the Helper will not come to you. But <f>ⓜ</f>if <f>ⓝ</f>I go, <f>ⓞ</f>I will send him to you.</J>
John 16-8 <J><f>ⓟ</f> And when he comes, he will <f>ⓠ</f>convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment:</J>
John 16-9 <J>concerning sin, <f>ⓡ</f>because they do not believe in me;</J>
John 16-10 <J><f>ⓢ</f> concerning righteousness, <f>ⓣ</f>because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer;</J>
John 16-11 <J><f>ⓤ</f> concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world <f>ⓥ</f>is judged.</J>
John 16-12 <pb/><J>“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</J>
John 16-13 <J>When <f>ⓦ</f>the Spirit of truth comes, <f>ⓧ</f>he will <f>ⓨ</f>guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but <f>ⓩ</f>whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.</J>
John 16-14 <J>He will <f>ⓐ</f>glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</J>
John 16-15 <J><f>ⓑ</f> All that the Father has is mine; <f>ⓒ</f>therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</J>
John 16-16 <pb/><J><f>ⓓ</f> “A little while, and you will see me no longer; and <f>ⓔ</f>again a little while, and you will see me.”</J>
John 16-17 So <f>ⓕ</f>some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’;</J> and, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>‘because I am going to the Father’</J>?”
John 16-18 So they were saying, “What does he mean by <J>‘a little while’</J>? <f>ⓘ</f>We do not know what he is talking about.”
John 16-19 <f>ⓙ</f> Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, <J>“Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, ‘A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me’?</J>
John 16-20 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓚ</f>you will weep and lament, but <f>ⓛ</f>the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but <f>ⓜ</f>your sorrow will turn into joy.</J>
John 16-21 <J><f>ⓝ</f> When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world.</J>
John 16-22 <J><f>ⓞ</f> So also you have sorrow now, but <f>ⓟ</f>I will see you again, and <f>ⓠ</f>your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.</J>
John 16-23 <J><f>ⓡ</f> In that day you will <f>ⓢ</f>ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓣ</f>whatever you ask of the Father in my name, <f>ⓤ</f>he will give it to you.</J>
John 16-24 <J>Until now you have asked nothing in my name. <f>ⓥ</f>Ask, and you will receive, <f>ⓦ</f>that your joy may be full.</J>
John 16-25 <pb/><J>“I have said these things to you in figures of speech. <f>ⓧ</f>The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father.</J>
John 16-26 <J>In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf;</J>
John 16-27 <J><f>ⓨ</f> for the Father himself loves you, because <f>ⓩ</f>you have loved me and <f>ⓐ</f>have believed that I came from God. <f>[1]</f></J>
John 16-28 <J><f>ⓑ</f> I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now <f>ⓒ</f>I am leaving the world and going to the Father.”</J>
John 16-29 <pb/>His disciples said, “Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not <f>ⓓ</f>using figurative speech!
John 16-30 Now we know that <f>ⓔ</f>you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; this is why we believe that <f>ⓕ</f>you came from God.”
John 16-31 Jesus answered them, <J>“Do you now believe?</J>
John 16-32 <J>Behold, <f>ⓖ</f>the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when <f>ⓗ</f>you will be scattered, each to his own home, and <f>ⓘ</f>will leave me alone. <f>ⓙ</f>Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</J>
John 16-33 <J>I have said these things to you, that <f>ⓚ</f>in me you may have peace. <f>ⓛ</f>In the world you will have <f>ⓜ</f>tribulation. But <f>ⓝ</f>take heart; <f>ⓞ</f>I have overcome the world.”</J>
