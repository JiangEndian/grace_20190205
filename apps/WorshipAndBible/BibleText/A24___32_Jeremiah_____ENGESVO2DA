Jeremiah 32-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD <f>ⓐ</f>in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, <f>ⓑ</f>which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
Jeremiah 32-2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet <f>ⓒ</f>was shut up in <f>ⓓ</f>the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah.
Jeremiah 32-3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓔ</f>Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it;
Jeremiah 32-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, <f>ⓖ</f>but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye.
Jeremiah 32-5 And <f>ⓗ</f>he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I visit him, declares the LORD. <f>ⓘ</f>Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed’?”
Jeremiah 32-6 <pb/>Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah 32-7 Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, <f>ⓙ</f>‘Buy my field that is at <f>ⓚ</f>Anathoth, <f>ⓛ</f>for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.’
Jeremiah 32-8 Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in <f>ⓜ</f>the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, ‘Buy my field that is at <f>ⓝ</f>Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
Jeremiah 32-9 <pb/>“And I bought the field at <f>ⓞ</f>Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and <f>ⓟ</f>weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.
Jeremiah 32-10 <f>ⓠ</f> I signed the deed, <f>ⓡ</f>sealed it, <f>ⓢ</f>got witnesses, and <f>ⓣ</f>weighed the money on scales.
Jeremiah 32-11 Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy.
Jeremiah 32-12 And I gave the deed of purchase to <f>ⓤ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of <f>ⓥ</f>the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in <f>ⓦ</f>the court of the guard.
Jeremiah 32-13 I charged <f>ⓧ</f>Baruch in their presence, saying,
Jeremiah 32-14 ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time.
Jeremiah 32-15 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and <f>ⓨ</f>fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’
Jeremiah 32-16 <pb/>“After I had given the deed of purchase to <f>ⓩ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:
Jeremiah 32-17 ‘Ah, Lord GOD! It is <f>ⓐ</f>you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by <f>ⓑ</f>your outstretched arm! <f>ⓒ</f>Nothing is too hard for you.
Jeremiah 32-18 <f>ⓓ</f> You show steadfast love to thousands, <f>ⓔ</f>but you repay the guilt of fathers <f>ⓕ</f>to their children after them, O great and <f>ⓖ</f>mighty God, whose name is the <f>ⓗ</f>LORD of hosts,
Jeremiah 32-19 <f>ⓘ</f> great in counsel and <f>ⓙ</f>mighty in deed, <f>ⓚ</f>whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of man, <f>ⓛ</f>rewarding each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.
Jeremiah 32-20 You have shown <f>ⓜ</f>signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, <f>ⓝ</f>and have made a name for yourself, as at this day.
Jeremiah 32-21 <f>ⓞ</f> You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and <f>ⓟ</f>outstretched arm, <f>ⓠ</f>and with great terror.
Jeremiah 32-22 And you gave them this land, <f>ⓡ</f>which you swore to their fathers to give them, <f>ⓢ</f>a land flowing with milk and honey.
Jeremiah 32-23 And they entered and took possession of it. <f>ⓣ</f>But they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of all you commanded them to do. Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them.
Jeremiah 32-24 Behold, <f>ⓤ</f>the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and <f>ⓥ</f>because of sword and famine and pestilence <f>ⓦ</f>the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has come to pass, and behold, you see it.
Jeremiah 32-25 Yet you, O Lord GOD, have said to me, <f>ⓧ</f>“Buy the field for money <f>ⓨ</f>and get witnesses” — though <f>ⓩ</f>the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.’”
Jeremiah 32-26 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 32-27 “Behold, I am the LORD, <f>ⓐ</f>the God of all flesh. <f>ⓑ</f>Is anything too hard for me?
Jeremiah 32-28 Therefore, thus says the LORD: <f>ⓒ</f>Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall capture it.
Jeremiah 32-29 The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city <f>ⓓ</f>shall come and set this city on fire and burn it, <f>ⓔ</f>with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to Baal <f>ⓕ</f>and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, <f>ⓖ</f>to provoke me to anger.
Jeremiah 32-30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight <f>ⓗ</f>from their youth. The children of Israel have done nothing but <f>ⓘ</f>provoke me to anger <f>ⓙ</f>by the work of their hands, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 32-31 This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, <f>ⓚ</f>so that I will remove it from my sight
Jeremiah 32-32 because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger — <f>ⓛ</f>their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 32-33 <f>ⓜ</f> They have turned to me their back and not their face. And though I have taught them <f>ⓝ</f>persistently, they have not listened <f>ⓞ</f>to receive instruction.
Jeremiah 32-34 They set up <f>ⓟ</f>their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
Jeremiah 32-35 They built the high places of Baal <f>ⓠ</f>in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, <f>ⓡ</f>to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, <f>ⓢ</f>though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do <f>ⓣ</f>this abomination, <f>ⓤ</f>to cause Judah to sin.
Jeremiah 32-36 <pb/>“Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, <f>ⓥ</f>‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence’:
Jeremiah 32-37 <f>ⓦ</f> Behold, I will gather them from all the countries <f>ⓧ</f>to which I drove them in <f>ⓨ</f>my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. I will bring them back to this place, <f>ⓩ</f>and I will make them dwell in safety.
Jeremiah 32-38 <f>ⓐ</f> And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
Jeremiah 32-39 <f>ⓑ</f> I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, <f>ⓒ</f>for their own good and the good of their children after them.
Jeremiah 32-40 <f>ⓓ</f> I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. <f>ⓔ</f>And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me.
Jeremiah 32-41 <f>ⓕ</f> I will rejoice in doing them good, <f>ⓖ</f>and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.
Jeremiah 32-42 <pb/>“For thus says the LORD: <f>ⓗ</f>Just as I have brought all this great disaster upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them.
Jeremiah 32-43 <f>ⓘ</f> Fields shall be bought in this land <f>ⓙ</f>of which you are saying, ‘It is a desolation, without man or beast; <f>ⓚ</f>it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’
Jeremiah 32-44 Fields shall be bought for money, and <f>ⓛ</f>deeds shall be signed and <f>ⓜ</f>sealed and <f>ⓝ</f>witnessed, <f>ⓞ</f>in the land of Benjamin, <f>ⓟ</f>in the places about Jerusalem, <f>ⓠ</f>and in the cities of Judah, <f>ⓡ</f>in the cities of the hill country, <f>ⓢ</f>in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for <f>ⓣ</f>I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD.”
