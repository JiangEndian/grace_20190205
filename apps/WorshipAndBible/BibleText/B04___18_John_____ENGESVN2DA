John 18-1 <pb/>When Jesus had spoken these words, <f>ⓐ</f>he went out with his disciples across <f>ⓑ</f>the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
John 18-2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew <f>ⓒ</f>the place, for <f>ⓓ</f>Jesus often met there with his disciples.
John 18-3 <f>ⓔ</f> So Judas, having procured a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
John 18-4 Then Jesus, <f>ⓕ</f>knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Whom do you seek?”</J>
John 18-5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, <J>“I am he.” <f>[1]</f></J> Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
John 18-6 <f>ⓗ</f> When Jesus <f>[2]</f> said to them, <J>“I am he,”</J> they drew back and fell to the ground.
John 18-7 So he asked them again, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“Whom do you seek?”</J> And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
John 18-8 Jesus answered, <J>“I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.”</J>
John 18-9 <f>ⓙ</f> This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: <J>“Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.”</J>
John 18-10 Then Simon Peter, <f>ⓚ</f>having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant <f>[3]</f> and cut off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)
John 18-11 So Jesus said to Peter, <J>“Put your sword into its sheath; <f>ⓛ</f>shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?”</J>
John 18-12 <pb/>So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews <f>[4]</f> arrested Jesus and bound him.
John 18-13 First they <f>ⓜ</f>led him to <f>ⓝ</f>Annas, for he was the father-in-law of <f>ⓞ</f>Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
John 18-14 It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews <f>ⓟ</f>that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.
John 18-15 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,
John 18-16 <f>ⓡ</f> but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in.
John 18-17 <f>ⓢ</f> The servant girl at the door said to Peter, “You also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.”
John 18-18 Now the servants <f>[5]</f> and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. <f>ⓣ</f>Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
John 18-19 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
John 18-20 Jesus answered him, <J>“I have spoken <f>ⓥ</f>openly <f>ⓦ</f>to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. <f>ⓧ</f>I have said nothing in secret.</J>
John 18-21 <J>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.”</J>
John 18-22 When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, <f>ⓨ</f>“Is that how you answer the high priest?”
John 18-23 Jesus answered him, <J>“If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?”</J>
John 18-24 <f>ⓩ</f> Annas then sent him bound to <f>ⓐ</f>Caiaphas the high priest.
John 18-25 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, “You also are not one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”
John 18-26 One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of <f>ⓒ</f>the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you <f>ⓓ</f>in the garden with him?”
John 18-27 Peter again denied it, and <f>ⓔ</f>at once a rooster crowed.
John 18-28 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Then they led Jesus <f>ⓖ</f>from the house of Caiaphas to <f>ⓗ</f>the governor's headquarters. <f>[6]</f> It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor's headquarters, <f>ⓘ</f>so that they would not be defiled, <f>ⓙ</f>but could eat the Passover.
John 18-29 <f>ⓚ</f> So Pilate went outside to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”
John 18-30 They answered him, “If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.”
John 18-31 Pilate said to them, <f>ⓛ</f>“Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.”
John 18-32 <f>ⓜ</f> This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken <f>ⓝ</f>to show by what kind of death he was going to die.
John 18-33 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, <f>ⓟ</f>“Are you the King of the Jews?”
John 18-34 Jesus answered, <J>“Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?”</J>
John 18-35 Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?”
John 18-36 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“My kingdom <f>ⓡ</f>is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, <f>ⓢ</f>my servants would have been fighting, that <f>ⓣ</f>I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”</J>
John 18-37 Then Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“You say that I am a king. <f>ⓥ</f>For this purpose I was born and for this purpose <f>ⓦ</f>I have come into the world — <f>ⓧ</f>to bear witness to the truth. <f>ⓨ</f>Everyone who is <f>ⓩ</f>of the truth <f>ⓐ</f>listens to my voice.”</J>
John 18-38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?” <pb/>After he had said this, <f>ⓑ</f>he went back outside to the Jews and told them, <f>ⓒ</f>“I find no guilt in him.
John 18-39 <f>ⓓ</f> But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
John 18-40 They cried out again, <f>ⓔ</f>“Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber. <f>[7]</f>
