Ezekiel 7-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 7-2 “And you, <f>ⓐ</f>O son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: <f>ⓑ</f>An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land. <f>[1]</f>
Ezekiel 7-3 Now <f>ⓒ</f>the end is upon you, and <f>ⓓ</f>I will send my anger upon you; <f>ⓔ</f>I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
Ezekiel 7-4 <f>ⓕ</f> And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but <f>ⓖ</f>I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. <f>ⓗ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 7-5 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster <f>ⓘ</f>after disaster! <f>[2]</f> Behold, it comes.
Ezekiel 7-6 <f>ⓙ</f> An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes.
Ezekiel 7-7 <f>ⓚ</f> Your doom <f>[3]</f> has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. <f>ⓛ</f>The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not <f>ⓜ</f>of joyful shouting on the mountains.
Ezekiel 7-8 Now I will soon <f>ⓝ</f>pour out my wrath upon you, and <f>ⓞ</f>spend my anger against you, <f>ⓟ</f>and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
Ezekiel 7-9 <f>ⓠ</f> And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. <f>ⓡ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD, who strikes.
Ezekiel 7-10 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! <f>ⓣ</f>Your doom has come; <f>ⓤ</f>the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.
Ezekiel 7-11 <f>ⓥ</f> Violence has grown up into <f>ⓦ</f>a rod of wickedness. <f>ⓧ</f>None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them. <f>[4]</f>
Ezekiel 7-12 <f>ⓨ</f> The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not <f>ⓩ</f>the buyer rejoice, nor <f>ⓐ</f>the seller mourn, <f>ⓑ</f>for wrath is upon all their multitude. <f>[5]</f>
Ezekiel 7-13 For <f>ⓒ</f>the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. <f>ⓓ</f>For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life. <f>[6]</f>
Ezekiel 7-14 <pb/>“They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, <f>ⓔ</f>for my wrath is upon all their multitude.
Ezekiel 7-15 <f>ⓕ</f> The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. <f>ⓖ</f>He who is in the field dies by the sword, <f>ⓗ</f>and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour.
Ezekiel 7-16 <f>ⓘ</f> And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like <f>ⓙ</f>doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity.
Ezekiel 7-17 <f>ⓚ</f> All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water.
Ezekiel 7-18 <f>ⓛ</f> They put on sackcloth, and <f>ⓜ</f>horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and <f>ⓝ</f>baldness on all their heads.
Ezekiel 7-19 They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. <f>ⓞ</f>Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. <f>ⓟ</f>For it was <f>ⓠ</f>the stumbling block of their iniquity.
Ezekiel 7-20 <f>ⓡ</f> His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and <f>ⓢ</f>they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore <f>ⓣ</f>I make it an unclean thing to them.
Ezekiel 7-21 And I will give it into the hands of <f>ⓤ</f>foreigners for prey, <f>ⓥ</f>and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and <f>ⓦ</f>they shall profane it.
Ezekiel 7-22 I will turn my face from them, and <f>ⓧ</f>they shall profane my treasured <f>[7]</f> place. Robbers shall enter <f>ⓨ</f>and profane it.
Ezekiel 7-23 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> “Forge a chain! <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>For the land is full of bloody crimes <f>ⓑ</f>and the city is full of violence.
Ezekiel 7-24 I will bring <f>ⓒ</f>the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. <f>ⓓ</f>I will put an end to the pride of the strong, <f>ⓔ</f>and their holy places <f>[9]</f> shall be profaned.
Ezekiel 7-25 <f>ⓕ</f> When anguish comes, <f>ⓖ</f>they will seek peace, but there shall be none.
Ezekiel 7-26 <f>ⓗ</f> Disaster comes upon disaster; <f>ⓘ</f>rumor follows rumor. <f>ⓙ</f>They seek a vision from the prophet, while <f>ⓚ</f>the law <f>[10]</f> perishes from the priest and <f>ⓛ</f>counsel from the elders.
Ezekiel 7-27 The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror. According to their way <f>ⓜ</f>I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, <f>ⓝ</f>and they shall know that I am the LORD.”
