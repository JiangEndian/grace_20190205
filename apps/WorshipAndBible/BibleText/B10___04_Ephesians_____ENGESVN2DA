Ephesians 4-1 <pb/>I therefore, <f>ⓐ</f>a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to <f>ⓑ</f>walk in a manner worthy of <f>ⓒ</f>the calling to which you have been called,
Ephesians 4-2 with all <f>ⓓ</f>humility and <f>ⓔ</f>gentleness, with <f>ⓕ</f>patience, <f>ⓖ</f>bearing with one another in love,
Ephesians 4-3 eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in <f>ⓗ</f>the bond of peace.
Ephesians 4-4 There is <f>ⓘ</f>one body and <f>ⓙ</f>one Spirit — just as you were called to the one <f>ⓚ</f>hope that belongs to your call —
Ephesians 4-5 <f>ⓛ</f> one Lord, <f>ⓜ</f>one faith, <f>ⓝ</f>one baptism,
Ephesians 4-6 <f>ⓞ</f> one God and Father of all, <f>ⓟ</f>who is over all and through all and in all.
Ephesians 4-7 But <f>ⓠ</f>grace was given <f>ⓡ</f>to each one of us <f>ⓢ</f>according to the measure of Christ's gift.
Ephesians 4-8 Therefore it says, <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“When he ascended on high <f>ⓤ</f>he led a host of captives, </t><t>and he gave gifts to men.” <f>[1]</f> </t>
Ephesians 4-9 <pb/>(<f>ⓥ</f>In saying, “He ascended,” what does it mean but that he had also descended into <f>ⓦ</f>the lower regions, the earth? <f>[2]</f>
Ephesians 4-10 He who descended is the one who also <f>ⓧ</f>ascended <f>ⓨ</f>far above all the heavens, that he might <f>ⓩ</f>fill all things.)
Ephesians 4-11 And <f>ⓐ</f>he gave the <f>ⓑ</f>apostles, the prophets, the <f>ⓒ</f>evangelists, the <f>ⓓ</f>shepherds <f>[3]</f> and teachers, <f>[4]</f>
Ephesians 4-12 <f>ⓔ</f> to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for <f>ⓕ</f>building up <f>ⓖ</f>the body of Christ,
Ephesians 4-13 until we all attain to <f>ⓗ</f>the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, <f>ⓘ</f>to mature manhood, <f>[5]</f> to the measure of the stature of <f>ⓙ</f>the fullness of Christ,
Ephesians 4-14 so that we may no longer be children, <f>ⓚ</f>tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in <f>ⓛ</f>deceitful schemes.
Ephesians 4-15 Rather, <f>ⓜ</f>speaking the truth in love, we are to <f>ⓝ</f>grow up in every way into him who is <f>ⓞ</f>the head, into Christ,
Ephesians 4-16 <f>ⓟ</f> from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, <f>ⓠ</f>when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.
Ephesians 4-17 <pb/>Now this I say and <f>ⓡ</f>testify in the Lord, <f>ⓢ</f>that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, <f>ⓣ</f>in the futility of their minds.
Ephesians 4-18 They <f>ⓤ</f>are darkened in their understanding, <f>ⓥ</f>alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to <f>ⓦ</f>their hardness of heart.
Ephesians 4-19 They <f>ⓧ</f>have become callous and <f>ⓨ</f>have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.
Ephesians 4-20 But that is not the way you <f>ⓩ</f>learned Christ! —
Ephesians 4-21 assuming that <f>ⓐ</f>you have heard about him and <f>ⓑ</f>were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,
Ephesians 4-22 to <f>ⓒ</f>put off <f>ⓓ</f>your old self, <f>[6]</f> which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through <f>ⓔ</f>deceitful desires,
Ephesians 4-23 and <f>ⓕ</f>to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,
Ephesians 4-24 and to put on <f>ⓖ</f>the new self, <f>ⓗ</f>created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
Ephesians 4-25 <pb/>Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you <f>ⓘ</f>speak the truth with his neighbor, for <f>ⓙ</f>we are members one of another.
Ephesians 4-26 <f>ⓚ</f> Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
Ephesians 4-27 and <f>ⓛ</f>give no opportunity to the devil.
Ephesians 4-28 Let the thief no longer steal, but rather <f>ⓜ</f>let him labor, <f>ⓝ</f>doing honest work with his own hands, so <f>ⓞ</f>that he may have something to share with anyone in need.
Ephesians 4-29 <f>ⓟ</f> Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give <f>ⓠ</f>grace to those who hear.
Ephesians 4-30 And <f>ⓡ</f>do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, <f>ⓢ</f>by whom you were sealed for the day of <f>ⓣ</f>redemption.
Ephesians 4-31 <f>ⓤ</f> Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
Ephesians 4-32 <f>ⓥ</f> Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, <f>ⓦ</f>forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
