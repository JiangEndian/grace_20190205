John 15-1 <pb/><J>“I am the <f>ⓐ</f>true vine, and my Father is <f>ⓑ</f>the vinedresser.</J>
John 15-2 <J><f>ⓒ</f> Every branch in me that does not bear fruit <f>ⓓ</f>he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, <f>ⓔ</f>that it may bear more fruit.</J>
John 15-3 <J>Already <f>ⓕ</f>you are clean <f>ⓖ</f>because of the word that I have spoken to you.</J>
John 15-4 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Abide <f>ⓘ</f>in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.</J>
John 15-5 <J>I am the vine; <f>ⓙ</f>you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that <f>ⓚ</f>bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</J>
John 15-6 <J>If anyone does not abide in me <f>ⓛ</f>he is thrown away like a branch and withers; <f>ⓜ</f>and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.</J>
John 15-7 <J>If <f>ⓝ</f>you abide in me, and my words abide in you, <f>ⓞ</f>ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.</J>
John 15-8 <J><f>ⓟ</f> By this my Father is glorified, that you <f>ⓠ</f>bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.</J>
John 15-9 <J><f>ⓡ</f> As the Father has loved me, <f>ⓢ</f>so have I loved you. Abide in my love.</J>
John 15-10 <J><f>ⓣ</f> If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as <f>ⓤ</f>I have kept <f>ⓥ</f>my Father's commandments and abide in his love.</J>
John 15-11 <J>These things I have spoken to you, <f>ⓦ</f>that my joy may be in you, and that <f>ⓧ</f>your joy may be full.</J>
John 15-12 <pb/><J><f>ⓨ</f> “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.</J>
John 15-13 <J><f>ⓩ</f> Greater love has no one than this, <f>ⓐ</f>that someone lay down his life for his friends.</J>
John 15-14 <J>You are <f>ⓑ</f>my friends <f>ⓒ</f>if you do what I command you.</J>
John 15-15 <J><f>ⓓ</f> No longer do I call you servants, <f>[1]</f> for the servant <f>ⓔ</f>does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for <f>ⓕ</f>all that I have heard from my Father <f>ⓖ</f>I have made known to you.</J>
John 15-16 <J>You did not choose me, but <f>ⓗ</f>I chose you and appointed you that you should go and <f>ⓘ</f>bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that <f>ⓙ</f>whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</J>
John 15-17 <J>These things I command you, <f>ⓚ</f>so that you will love one another.</J>
John 15-18 <pb/><J><f>ⓛ</f> “If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.</J>
John 15-19 <J><f>ⓜ</f> If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because <f>ⓝ</f>you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</J>
John 15-20 <J>Remember the word that I said to you: <f>ⓞ</f>‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, <f>ⓟ</f>they will also persecute you. <f>ⓠ</f>If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.</J>
John 15-21 <J>But <f>ⓡ</f>all these things they will do to you <f>ⓢ</f>on account of my name, <f>ⓣ</f>because they do not know him who sent me.</J>
John 15-22 <J>If I had not come and spoken to them, <f>ⓤ</f>they would not have been guilty of sin, <f>[2]</f> but now they have no excuse for their sin.</J>
John 15-23 <J><f>ⓥ</f> Whoever hates me hates my Father also.</J>
John 15-24 <J><f>ⓦ</f> If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, <f>ⓧ</f>they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have <f>ⓨ</f>seen and hated both me and my Father.</J>
John 15-25 <J>But <f>ⓩ</f>the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: <f>ⓐ</f>‘They hated me without a cause.’</J>
John 15-26 <pb/><J>“But <f>ⓑ</f>when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, <f>ⓒ</f>he will bear witness about me.</J>
John 15-27 <J>And <f>ⓓ</f>you also will bear witness, <f>ⓔ</f>because you have been with me <f>ⓕ</f>from the beginning.</J>
