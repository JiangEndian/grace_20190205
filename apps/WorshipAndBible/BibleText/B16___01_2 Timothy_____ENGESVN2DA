2 Timothy 1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>an apostle of Christ Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>by the will of God according to <f>ⓒ</f>the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus,
2 Timothy 1-2 <pb/>To Timothy, <f>ⓓ</f>my beloved child: <pb/><f>ⓔ</f>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2 Timothy 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> I thank God <f>ⓖ</f>whom I serve, as did my ancestors, <f>ⓗ</f>with a clear conscience, as I remember you <f>ⓘ</f>constantly in my prayers night and day.
2 Timothy 1-4 <f>ⓙ</f> As I remember your tears, <f>ⓚ</f>I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy.
2 Timothy 1-5 I am reminded of <f>ⓛ</f>your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and <f>ⓜ</f>your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.
2 Timothy 1-6 For this reason I remind you <f>ⓝ</f>to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands,
2 Timothy 1-7 for God gave us <f>ⓞ</f>a spirit not of fear but <f>ⓟ</f>of power and love and self-control.
2 Timothy 1-8 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓠ</f>do not be ashamed of <f>ⓡ</f>the testimony about our Lord, nor of <f>ⓢ</f>me his prisoner, but <f>ⓣ</f>share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God,
2 Timothy 1-9 <f>ⓤ</f> who saved us and <f>ⓥ</f>called us to <f>[1]</f> a holy calling, <f>ⓦ</f>not because of our works but because of <f>ⓧ</f>his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus <f>ⓨ</f>before the ages began, <f>[2]</f>
2 Timothy 1-10 and which now has <f>ⓩ</f>been manifested through <f>ⓐ</f>the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>who abolished death and <f>ⓒ</f>brought life and <f>ⓓ</f>immortality to light through the gospel,
2 Timothy 1-11 <f>ⓔ</f> for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher,
2 Timothy 1-12 <f>ⓕ</f> which is why I suffer as I do. But <f>ⓖ</f>I am not ashamed, for <f>ⓗ</f>I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until <f>ⓘ</f>that day <f>ⓙ</f>what has been entrusted to me. <f>[3]</f>
2 Timothy 1-13 <f>ⓚ</f> Follow <f>ⓛ</f>the pattern of <f>ⓜ</f>the sound <f>[4]</f> words <f>ⓝ</f>that you have heard from me, in <f>ⓞ</f>the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy 1-14 By the Holy Spirit <f>ⓟ</f>who dwells within us, guard <f>ⓠ</f>the good deposit entrusted to you.
2 Timothy 1-15 <pb/>You are aware that <f>ⓡ</f>all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
2 Timothy 1-16 May the Lord grant mercy to <f>ⓢ</f>the household of Onesiphorus, for he often <f>ⓣ</f>refreshed me and was not ashamed of <f>ⓤ</f>my chains,
2 Timothy 1-17 but when he arrived in Rome <f>ⓥ</f>he searched for me earnestly and found me —
2 Timothy 1-18 may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on <f>ⓦ</f>that day! — and you well know all the service he <f>ⓧ</f>rendered at Ephesus.
