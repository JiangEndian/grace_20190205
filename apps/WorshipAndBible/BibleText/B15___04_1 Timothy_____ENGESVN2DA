1 Timothy 4-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>the Spirit expressly says that <f>ⓑ</f>in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to <f>ⓒ</f>deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,
1 Timothy 4-2 through the insincerity of <f>ⓓ</f>liars whose consciences are seared,
1 Timothy 4-3 <f>ⓔ</f> who forbid marriage and <f>ⓕ</f>require abstinence from foods <f>ⓖ</f>that God created <f>ⓗ</f>to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy 4-4 For <f>ⓘ</f>everything created by God is good, and <f>ⓙ</f>nothing is to be rejected if it is <f>ⓚ</f>received with thanksgiving,
1 Timothy 4-5 for it is made holy <f>ⓛ</f>by the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy 4-6 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> If you put these things before the brothers, <f>[1]</f> you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have <f>ⓝ</f>followed.
1 Timothy 4-7 Have nothing to do with irreverent, <f>ⓞ</f>silly myths. Rather <f>ⓟ</f>train yourself for godliness;
1 Timothy 4-8 for while <f>ⓠ</f>bodily training is of some value, godliness <f>ⓡ</f>is of value in every way, as <f>ⓢ</f>it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
1 Timothy 4-9 The saying is <f>ⓣ</f>trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance.
1 Timothy 4-10 For to this end we toil and strive, <f>[2]</f> because we have our hope set on the living God, <f>ⓤ</f>who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
1 Timothy 4-11 <pb/>Command and teach <f>ⓥ</f>these things.
1 Timothy 4-12 <f>ⓦ</f> Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers <f>ⓧ</f>an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
1 Timothy 4-13 Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.
1 Timothy 4-14 <f>ⓨ</f> Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you <f>ⓩ</f>by prophecy when the council of elders <f>ⓐ</f>laid their hands on you.
1 Timothy 4-15 Practice these things, immerse yourself in them, <f>[3]</f> so that <f>ⓑ</f>all may see your progress.
1 Timothy 4-16 <f>ⓒ</f> Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save <f>ⓓ</f>both yourself and <f>ⓔ</f>your hearers.
