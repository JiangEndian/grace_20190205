Ezekiel 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by <f>ⓑ</f>the Chebar canal, <f>ⓒ</f>the heavens were opened, and I saw <f>ⓓ</f>visions of God. <f>[1]</f>
Ezekiel 1-2 On the fifth day of the month (it was <f>ⓔ</f>the fifth year of <f>ⓕ</f>the exile of King Jehoiachin),
Ezekiel 1-3 the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel <f>ⓖ</f>the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by <f>ⓗ</f>the Chebar canal, and <f>ⓘ</f>the hand of the LORD was upon him there.
Ezekiel 1-4 <pb/>As I looked, behold, <f>ⓙ</f>a stormy wind came <f>ⓚ</f>out of the north, and a great cloud, with <f>ⓛ</f>brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, <f>ⓜ</f>as it were gleaming metal. <f>[2]</f>
Ezekiel 1-5 And from the midst of it came the likeness of <f>ⓝ</f>four living creatures. <f>ⓞ</f>And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness,
Ezekiel 1-6 <f>ⓟ</f> but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.
Ezekiel 1-7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled <f>ⓠ</f>like burnished bronze.
Ezekiel 1-8 Under their wings <f>ⓡ</f>on their four sides <f>ⓢ</f>they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
Ezekiel 1-9 their wings touched one another. <f>ⓣ</f>Each one of them went straight forward, <f>ⓤ</f>without turning as they went.
Ezekiel 1-10 As for the likeness of their faces, <f>ⓥ</f>each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel 1-11 Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while <f>ⓦ</f>two covered their bodies.
Ezekiel 1-12 <f>ⓧ</f> And each went straight forward. <f>ⓨ</f>Wherever the spirit <f>[3]</f> would go, they went, without turning as they went.
Ezekiel 1-13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was <f>ⓩ</f>like burning coals of fire, <f>ⓐ</f>like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. <f>ⓑ</f>And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
Ezekiel 1-14 And the living creatures <f>ⓒ</f>darted to and fro, <f>ⓓ</f>like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
Ezekiel 1-15 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. <f>[4]</f>
Ezekiel 1-16 <f>ⓕ</f> As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like <f>ⓖ</f>the gleaming of beryl. <f>ⓗ</f>And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel.
Ezekiel 1-17 <f>ⓘ</f> When they went, they went <f>ⓙ</f>in any of their four directions <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>without turning as they went.
Ezekiel 1-18 And their rims were tall and awesome, <f>ⓛ</f>and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
Ezekiel 1-19 <f>ⓜ</f> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; <f>ⓝ</f>and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
Ezekiel 1-20 <f>ⓞ</f> Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, <f>ⓟ</f>for the spirit of the living creatures <f>[6]</f> was in the wheels.
Ezekiel 1-21 <f>ⓠ</f> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; <f>ⓡ</f>and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, <f>ⓢ</f>for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
Ezekiel 1-22 <pb/>Over the heads of the living creatures there was <f>ⓣ</f>the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring <f>ⓤ</f>crystal, spread out above their heads.
Ezekiel 1-23 And under the expanse their wings were <f>ⓥ</f>stretched out straight, one toward another. <f>ⓦ</f>And each creature had two wings covering its body.
Ezekiel 1-24 And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings <f>ⓧ</f>like the sound of many waters, like <f>ⓨ</f>the sound of the <f>ⓩ</f>Almighty, a sound of tumult <f>ⓐ</f>like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
Ezekiel 1-25 And there came a voice from above <f>ⓑ</f>the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
Ezekiel 1-26 <pb/>And above the expanse over their heads there was <f>ⓒ</f>the likeness of a throne, <f>ⓓ</f>in appearance <f>ⓔ</f>like sapphire; <f>[7]</f> and seated above the likeness of a throne was <f>ⓕ</f>a likeness with a human appearance.
Ezekiel 1-27 And <f>ⓖ</f>upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were <f>ⓗ</f>gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and <f>ⓘ</f>there was brightness around him. <f>[8]</f>
Ezekiel 1-28 Like the appearance of <f>ⓙ</f>the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. <pb/>Such was the appearance of the likeness of <f>ⓚ</f>the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, <f>ⓛ</f>I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
