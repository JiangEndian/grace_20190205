Daniel 2-1 <pb/>In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; <f>ⓐ</f>his spirit was troubled, and <f>ⓑ</f>his sleep left him.
Daniel 2-2 Then the king commanded that <f>ⓒ</f>the magicians, <f>ⓓ</f>the enchanters, the <f>ⓔ</f>sorcerers, and <f>ⓕ</f>the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and <f>ⓖ</f>stood before the king.
Daniel 2-3 And the king said to them, “I had a dream, and <f>ⓗ</f>my spirit is troubled to know the dream.”
Daniel 2-4 Then <f>ⓘ</f>the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓙ</f>“O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”
Daniel 2-5 The king answered and said to <f>ⓚ</f>the Chaldeans, “The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be <f>ⓛ</f>torn limb from limb, <f>ⓜ</f>and your <f>ⓝ</f>houses shall be laid in ruins.
Daniel 2-6 But if you show the dream and its interpretation, <f>ⓞ</f>you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. <f>ⓟ</f>Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.”
Daniel 2-7 They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation.”
Daniel 2-8 The king answered and said, “I know with certainty that you are trying to <f>ⓠ</f>gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm —
Daniel 2-9 if you do not make the dream known to me, <f>ⓡ</f>there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till <f>ⓢ</f>the times change. <f>ⓣ</f>Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.”
Daniel 2-10 <f>ⓤ</f> The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or <f>ⓥ</f>Chaldean.
Daniel 2-11 The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except <f>ⓦ</f>the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”
Daniel 2-12 <pb/>Because of this the king was angry and <f>ⓧ</f>very furious, and <f>ⓨ</f>commanded that all <f>ⓩ</f>the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.
Daniel 2-13 So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought <f>ⓐ</f>Daniel and his companions, to kill them.
Daniel 2-14 Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to <f>ⓑ</f>Arioch, the <f>ⓒ</f>captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel 2-15 He declared <f>[2]</f> to Arioch, the king's captain, “Why is the decree of the king <f>ⓓ</f>so urgent?” Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel.
Daniel 2-16 And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king.
Daniel 2-17 <pb/>Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to <f>ⓔ</f>Hananiah, <f>ⓕ</f>Mishael, and <f>ⓖ</f>Azariah, his companions,
Daniel 2-18 <f>ⓗ</f> and told them to seek mercy from the <f>ⓘ</f>God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not <f>ⓙ</f>be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel 2-19 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in <f>ⓚ</f>a vision of the night. Then Daniel <f>ⓛ</f>blessed the <f>ⓜ</f>God of heaven.
Daniel 2-20 Daniel answered and said: <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>to whom belong wisdom and might.</t>
Daniel 2-21 <t><f>ⓟ</f> He changes times and seasons; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>he removes kings and sets up kings; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>he gives wisdom to the wise </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>and knowledge to those who have understanding;</t>
Daniel 2-22 <t><f>ⓣ</f> he reveals deep and hidden things; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>he knows what is in the darkness, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>and the light dwells with him.</t>
Daniel 2-23 <t>To you, O <f>ⓦ</f>God of my fathers, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>I give thanks and praise, </t><t>for <f>ⓨ</f>you have given me wisdom and might, </t><t>and have now made known to me what <f>ⓩ</f>we asked of you, </t><t>for you have made known to us the king's matter.” </t>
Daniel 2-24 <pb/>Therefore Daniel went in to <f>ⓐ</f>Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation.”
Daniel 2-25 <pb/>Then <f>ⓑ</f>Arioch brought in Daniel before the king <f>ⓒ</f>in haste and said thus to him: “I have found <f>ⓓ</f>among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation.”
Daniel 2-26 The king declared to Daniel, <f>ⓔ</f>whose name was Belteshazzar, <f>ⓕ</f>“Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?”
Daniel 2-27 Daniel answered the king and said, “No wise men, <f>ⓖ</f>enchanters, <f>ⓗ</f>magicians, or <f>ⓘ</f>astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked,
Daniel 2-28 but <f>ⓙ</f>there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar <f>ⓚ</f>what will be in the latter days. Your dream and <f>ⓛ</f>the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these:
Daniel 2-29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, <f>ⓜ</f>and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be.
Daniel 2-30 But <f>ⓝ</f>as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that <f>ⓞ</f>you may know the thoughts of your mind.
Daniel 2-31 <pb/>“You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening.
Daniel 2-32 <f>ⓟ</f> The head of this image was of fine gold, <f>ⓠ</f>its chest and arms of silver, its middle and <f>ⓡ</f>thighs of bronze,
Daniel 2-33 <f>ⓢ</f> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
Daniel 2-34 As you looked, a stone was cut out <f>ⓣ</f>by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and <f>ⓤ</f>broke them in pieces.
Daniel 2-35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became <f>ⓥ</f>like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that <f>ⓦ</f>not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became <f>ⓧ</f>a great mountain <f>ⓨ</f>and filled the whole earth.
Daniel 2-36 <pb/>“This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation.
Daniel 2-37 You, O king, <f>ⓩ</f>the king of kings, to whom <f>ⓐ</f>the God of heaven <f>ⓑ</f>has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory,
Daniel 2-38 and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, <f>ⓒ</f>the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all — you are <f>ⓓ</f>the head of gold.
Daniel 2-39 <f>ⓔ</f> Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom <f>ⓕ</f>of bronze, <f>ⓖ</f>which shall rule over all the earth.
Daniel 2-40 And <f>ⓗ</f>there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron <f>ⓘ</f>breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall <f>ⓙ</f>break and crush all these.
Daniel 2-41 And as you saw <f>ⓚ</f>the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the <f>ⓛ</f>firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay.
Daniel 2-42 And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.
Daniel 2-43 As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, <f>[3]</f> but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.
Daniel 2-44 And in the days of those kings <f>ⓜ</f>the God of heaven will set up <f>ⓝ</f>a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. <f>ⓞ</f>It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and <f>ⓟ</f>it shall stand forever,
Daniel 2-45 just as <f>ⓠ</f>you saw that <f>ⓡ</f>a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that <f>ⓢ</f>it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A <f>ⓣ</f>great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”
Daniel 2-46 <pb/>Then King Nebuchadnezzar <f>ⓤ</f>fell upon his face and <f>ⓥ</f>paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that <f>ⓦ</f>an offering and <f>ⓧ</f>incense be offered up to him.
Daniel 2-47 The king answered and said to Daniel, “Truly, your <f>ⓨ</f>God is God of gods and <f>ⓩ</f>Lord of kings, and <f>ⓐ</f>a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.”
Daniel 2-48 Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great <f>ⓑ</f>gifts, and made him ruler over the whole <f>ⓒ</f>province of Babylon and <f>ⓓ</f>chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel 2-49 Daniel made a request of the king, and he <f>ⓔ</f>appointed <f>ⓕ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of <f>ⓖ</f>the province of Babylon. But Daniel <f>ⓗ</f>remained at the king's court.
