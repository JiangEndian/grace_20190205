Luke 20-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> One day, <f>ⓑ</f>as Jesus <f>[1]</f> was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, <f>ⓒ</f>the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up
Luke 20-2 and said to him, “Tell us <f>ⓓ</f>by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority.”
Luke 20-3 He answered them, <J>“I also will ask you a question. Now tell me,</J>
Luke 20-4 <J>was the baptism of John <f>ⓔ</f>from heaven or from man?”</J>
Luke 20-5 And they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, <f>ⓕ</f>‘Why did you not believe him?’
Luke 20-6 But if we say, ‘From man,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was <f>ⓖ</f>a prophet.”
Luke 20-7 So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
Luke 20-8 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</J>
Luke 20-9 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> And he began to tell the people this parable: <J>“A man planted <f>ⓘ</f>a vineyard and <f>ⓙ</f>let it out to tenants and <f>ⓚ</f>went into another country for a long while.</J>
Luke 20-10 <J>When the time came, he sent a servant <f>[2]</f> to the tenants, so that <f>ⓛ</f>they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. <f>ⓜ</f>But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</J>
Luke 20-11 <J><f>ⓝ</f> And <f>ⓞ</f>he sent another servant. But they also beat and <f>ⓟ</f>treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</J>
Luke 20-12 <J><f>ⓠ</f> And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out.</J>
Luke 20-13 <J>Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my <f>ⓡ</f>beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’</J>
Luke 20-14 <J>But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, <f>ⓢ</f>‘This is the heir. <f>ⓣ</f>Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.’</J>
Luke 20-15 <J>And they <f>ⓤ</f>threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</J>
Luke 20-16 <J><f>ⓥ</f> He will <f>ⓦ</f>come and destroy those tenants and <f>ⓧ</f>give the vineyard to others.”</J> When they heard this, they said, “Surely not!”
Luke 20-17 But he <f>ⓨ</f>looked directly at them and said, <J>“What then is this that is written:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓩ</f>“‘The stone that the builders rejected</J> </t><t><J>has become the cornerstone’? <f>[3]</f></J> </t>
Luke 20-18 <pb/><J><f>ⓐ</f> Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls <f>ⓑ</f>on anyone, it will crush him.”</J>
Luke 20-19 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people.
Luke 20-20 <f>ⓓ</f> So they <f>ⓔ</f>watched him and sent spies, who <f>ⓕ</f>pretended to be sincere, that they might <f>ⓖ</f>catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of <f>ⓗ</f>the governor.
Luke 20-21 So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and <f>ⓘ</f>show no partiality, <f>[4]</f> but truly teach <f>ⓙ</f>the way of God.
Luke 20-22 Is it lawful for us to give <f>ⓚ</f>tribute to <f>ⓛ</f>Caesar, or not?”
Luke 20-23 But he perceived their <f>ⓜ</f>craftiness, and said to them,
Luke 20-24 <J>“Show me <f>ⓝ</f>a denarius. <f>[5]</f> Whose likeness and inscription does it have?”</J> They said, “Caesar's.”
Luke 20-25 He said to them, <J>“Then <f>ⓞ</f>render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</J>
Luke 20-26 And they were not able in the presence of the people <f>ⓟ</f>to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.
Luke 20-27 <pb/>There came to him <f>ⓠ</f>some Sadducees, <f>ⓡ</f>those who deny that there is a resurrection,
Luke 20-28 and they asked him a question, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us <f>ⓢ</f>that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man <f>[6]</f> must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
Luke 20-29 Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children.
Luke 20-30 And the second
Luke 20-31 and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died.
Luke 20-32 Afterward the woman also died.
Luke 20-33 In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.”
Luke 20-34 <pb/>And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓣ</f>“The sons of this age <f>ⓤ</f>marry and <f>ⓥ</f>are given in marriage,</J>
Luke 20-35 <J>but those who are <f>ⓦ</f>considered worthy to attain to <f>ⓧ</f>that age and to the resurrection from the dead <f>ⓨ</f>neither marry <f>ⓩ</f>nor are given in marriage,</J>
Luke 20-36 <J>for <f>ⓐ</f>they cannot die anymore, because they are <f>ⓑ</f>equal to angels and <f>ⓒ</f>are <f>ⓓ</f>sons of God, being <f>ⓔ</f>sons <f>[7]</f> of the resurrection.</J>
Luke 20-37 <J>But that the dead are raised, <f>ⓕ</f>even Moses showed, in <f>ⓖ</f>the passage about the bush, where he calls <f>ⓗ</f>the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</J>
Luke 20-38 <J>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all <f>ⓘ</f>live to him.”</J>
Luke 20-39 Then some of the scribes <f>ⓙ</f>answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”
Luke 20-40 For <f>ⓚ</f>they no longer dared to ask him any question.
Luke 20-41 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> But he said to them, <J>“How can they say that <f>ⓜ</f>the Christ is <f>ⓝ</f>David's son?</J>
Luke 20-42 <J>For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓞ</f>“‘The Lord said to my Lord,</J> </t><t><J>“Sit at my right hand,</J></t>
Luke 20-43 <t><J>until I make your enemies <f>ⓟ</f>your footstool.”’</J> </t>
Luke 20-44 <pb/><J>David thus calls him Lord, so <f>ⓠ</f>how is he his son?”</J>
Luke 20-45 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,
Luke 20-46 <J>“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and <f>ⓢ</f>the places of honor at feasts,</J>
Luke 20-47 <J><f>ⓣ</f> who devour widows' houses and <f>ⓤ</f>for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”</J>
