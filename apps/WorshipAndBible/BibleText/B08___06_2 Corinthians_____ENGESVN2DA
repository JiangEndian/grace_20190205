2 Corinthians 6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Working together with him, then, <f>ⓑ</f>we appeal to you <f>ⓒ</f>not to receive the grace of God in vain.
2 Corinthians 6-2 For he says, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“In a favorable time I listened to you, </t><t>and in a day of salvation I have helped you.” </t> <pb/>Behold, <f>ⓔ</f>now is the <f>ⓕ</f>favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
2 Corinthians 6-3 We <f>ⓖ</f>put no obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry,
2 Corinthians 6-4 but <f>ⓗ</f>as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: <f>ⓘ</f>by great endurance, <f>ⓙ</f>in afflictions, <f>ⓚ</f>hardships, calamities,
2 Corinthians 6-5 <f>ⓛ</f> beatings, imprisonments, <f>ⓜ</f>riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger;
2 Corinthians 6-6 <f>ⓝ</f> by purity, <f>ⓞ</f>knowledge, patience, kindness, <f>ⓟ</f>the Holy Spirit, <f>ⓠ</f>genuine love;
2 Corinthians 6-7 by <f>ⓡ</f>truthful speech, and <f>ⓢ</f>the power of God; with <f>ⓣ</f>the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;
2 Corinthians 6-8 through honor and dishonor, <f>ⓤ</f>through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true;
2 Corinthians 6-9 as unknown, and <f>ⓥ</f>yet well known; <f>ⓦ</f>as dying, and behold, we live; <f>ⓧ</f>as punished, and yet not killed;
2 Corinthians 6-10 <f>ⓨ</f> as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; <f>ⓩ</f>as poor, yet making many rich; <f>ⓐ</f>as having nothing, <f>ⓑ</f>yet possessing everything.
2 Corinthians 6-11 <pb/>We have spoken freely to you, <f>[1]</f> Corinthians; <f>ⓒ</f>our heart is wide open.
2 Corinthians 6-12 You are not restricted by us, but <f>ⓓ</f>you are restricted in your own affections.
2 Corinthians 6-13 <f>ⓔ</f> In return (I speak <f>ⓕ</f>as to children) widen your hearts also.
2 Corinthians 6-14 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For <f>ⓗ</f>what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or <f>ⓘ</f>what fellowship has light with darkness?
2 Corinthians 6-15 <f>ⓙ</f> What accord has Christ with Belial? <f>[2]</f> Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians 6-16 What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For <f>ⓚ</f>we are the temple of the living God; as God said, <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f>“I will make my dwelling among them and <f>ⓜ</f>walk among them, </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>I will be their God, </t><t>and they shall be my people.</t>
2 Corinthians 6-17 <t>Therefore <f>ⓞ</f>go out from their midst, </t><t>and be separate from them, says the Lord, </t><t>and touch no unclean thing; </t><t>then I will welcome you,</t>
2 Corinthians 6-18 <t><f>ⓟ</f> and I will be a father to you, </t><t>and you shall be sons and daughters to me, </t><t>says the Lord Almighty.” </t>
