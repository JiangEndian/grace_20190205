Ecclesiastes 2-1 <pb/>I <f>ⓐ</f>said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But behold, this also was vanity. <f>[1]</f>
Ecclesiastes 2-2 I <f>ⓑ</f>said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of pleasure, “What use is it?”
Ecclesiastes 2-3 I <f>ⓒ</f>searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine — my heart still guiding me with wisdom — and how to lay hold on <f>ⓓ</f>folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.
Ecclesiastes 2-4 I made great works. I <f>ⓔ</f>built houses and planted <f>ⓕ</f>vineyards for myself.
Ecclesiastes 2-5 I made myself <f>ⓖ</f>gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
Ecclesiastes 2-6 I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.
Ecclesiastes 2-7 I bought male and female slaves, and had <f>ⓗ</f>slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of <f>ⓘ</f>herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes 2-8 I also gathered for myself silver and <f>ⓙ</f>gold and the treasure of <f>ⓚ</f>kings and <f>ⓛ</f>provinces. I got <f>ⓜ</f>singers, both men and women, and many <f>ⓝ</f>concubines, <f>[2]</f> the delight of the sons of man.
Ecclesiastes 2-9 <pb/>So I became great and <f>ⓞ</f>surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my <f>ⓟ</f>wisdom remained with me.
Ecclesiastes 2-10 And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart <f>ⓠ</f>found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my <f>ⓡ</f>reward for all my toil.
Ecclesiastes 2-11 Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was <f>ⓢ</f>vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing <f>ⓣ</f>to be gained under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 2-12 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> So I turned to consider <f>ⓥ</f>wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only <f>ⓦ</f>what has already been done.
Ecclesiastes 2-13 Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.
Ecclesiastes 2-14 <f>ⓧ</f> The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the <f>ⓨ</f>same event happens to all of them.
Ecclesiastes 2-15 Then I said in my heart, <f>ⓩ</f>“What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?” And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 2-16 For of the wise as of the fool there is <f>ⓐ</f>no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. <f>ⓑ</f>How the wise dies just like the fool!
Ecclesiastes 2-17 So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for <f>ⓒ</f>all is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes 2-18 <pb/>I hated <f>ⓓ</f>all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must <f>ⓔ</f>leave it to the man who will come after me,
Ecclesiastes 2-19 and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 2-20 So I <f>ⓕ</f>turned about and gave my heart up to despair <f>ⓖ</f>over all the toil of my labors under the sun,
Ecclesiastes 2-21 because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
Ecclesiastes 2-22 What has a man from <f>ⓗ</f>all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?
Ecclesiastes 2-23 For <f>ⓘ</f>all his days are full of sorrow, and his <f>ⓙ</f>work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 2-24 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> There is nothing better for a person than that he should <f>ⓛ</f>eat and drink and find enjoyment <f>[3]</f> in his toil. This also, I saw, is <f>ⓜ</f>from the hand of God,
Ecclesiastes 2-25 for apart from him <f>[4]</f> who can eat or who can have enjoyment?
Ecclesiastes 2-26 For to the one who pleases him <f>ⓝ</f>God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given <f>ⓞ</f>the business of gathering and collecting, <f>ⓟ</f>only to give to one who pleases God. <f>ⓠ</f>This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
