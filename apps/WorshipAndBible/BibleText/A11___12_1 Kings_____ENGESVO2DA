1 Kings 12-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Rehoboam went to <f>ⓑ</f>Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
1 Kings 12-2 And as soon as <f>ⓒ</f>Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for <f>ⓓ</f>he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from <f>[1]</f> Egypt.
1 Kings 12-3 And they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam,
1 Kings 12-4 <f>ⓔ</f> “Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.”
1 Kings 12-5 He said to them, <f>ⓕ</f>“Go away for three days, then come again to me.” So the people went away.
1 Kings 12-6 <pb/>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, “How do you advise me to answer this people?”
1 Kings 12-7 And they said to him, “If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever.”
1 Kings 12-8 But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.
1 Kings 12-9 And he said to them, “What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke that your father put on us’?”
1 Kings 12-10 And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, “Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,’ thus shall you say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.
1 Kings 12-11 And now, whereas <f>ⓖ</f>my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.’”
1 Kings 12-12 <pb/>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Come to me again the third day.”
1 Kings 12-13 And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him,
1 Kings 12-14 he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, <f>ⓘ</f>“My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”
1 Kings 12-15 So the king did not listen to the people, for <f>ⓙ</f>it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfill his word, which <f>ⓚ</f>the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1 Kings 12-16 <pb/>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, “What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. <f>ⓛ</f>To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.” So Israel went to their tents.
1 Kings 12-17 But Rehoboam reigned over <f>ⓜ</f>the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.
1 Kings 12-18 Then King Rehoboam sent <f>ⓝ</f>Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
1 Kings 12-19 <f>ⓞ</f> So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
1 Kings 12-20 And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David but <f>ⓟ</f>the tribe of Judah only.
1 Kings 12-21 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
1 Kings 12-22 But the word of God came to <f>ⓡ</f>Shemaiah the man of God:
1 Kings 12-23 “Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the <f>ⓢ</f>rest of the people,
1 Kings 12-24 ‘Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel. Every man return to his home, <f>ⓣ</f>for this thing is from me.’” So they listened to the word of the LORD and went home again, according to the word of the LORD.
1 Kings 12-25 <pb/>Then Jeroboam <f>ⓤ</f>built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And he went out from there and <f>ⓥ</f>built Penuel.
1 Kings 12-26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David.
1 Kings 12-27 If this people <f>ⓦ</f>go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”
1 Kings 12-28 So the king took counsel and <f>ⓧ</f>made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, “You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. <f>ⓨ</f>Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”
1 Kings 12-29 And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
1 Kings 12-30 Then <f>ⓩ</f>this thing became a sin, for the people went as far as Dan to be before one. <f>[2]</f>
1 Kings 12-31 He also made <f>ⓐ</f>temples on high places and <f>ⓑ</f>appointed priests from among all the people, who were not of the Levites.
1 Kings 12-32 And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like <f>ⓒ</f>the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he made. And he placed in Bethel <f>ⓓ</f>the priests of the high places that he had made.
1 Kings 12-33 He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised from his own heart. And he instituted a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar <f>ⓔ</f>to make offerings.
