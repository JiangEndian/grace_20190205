2 Chronicles 35-8 And his officials contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. <f>ⓛ</f>Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings 2,600 Passover lambs and 300 bulls.
2 Chronicles 35-9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 bulls.

2 Chronicles 35-13 <f>ⓡ</f> And they roasted the Passover lamb with fire according to the rule; and they <f>ⓢ</f>boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people.
2 Chronicles 35-14 And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
2 Chronicles 35-15 The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place <f>ⓣ</f>according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's <f>ⓤ</f>seer; <f>ⓥ</f>and the gatekeepers were at each gate.

2 Chronicles 35-18 <f>ⓧ</f> No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. None of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as was kept by Josiah, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 35-19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.

2 Chronicles 35-22 Nevertheless, Josiah did not turn away from him, but <f>ⓐ</f>disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to fight in the plain of <f>ⓑ</f>Megiddo.
2 Chronicles 35-23 And the archers shot King Josiah. And the king said to his servants, <f>ⓒ</f>“Take me away, for I am badly wounded.”
2 Chronicles 35-24 So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. <f>ⓓ</f>All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
2 Chronicles 35-25 <f>ⓔ</f> Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josiah; and all <f>ⓕ</f>the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made these a rule in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments.

2 Chronicles 35-27 and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
