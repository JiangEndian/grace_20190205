Zechariah 14-1 <pb/>Behold, <f>ⓐ</f>a day is coming for the LORD, when the spoil taken from you will be divided in your midst.
Zechariah 14-2 For <f>ⓑ</f>I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and <f>ⓒ</f>the city shall be taken <f>ⓓ</f>and the houses plundered <f>ⓔ</f>and the women raped. <f>ⓕ</f>Half of the city shall go out into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
Zechariah 14-3 <f>ⓖ</f> Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle.
Zechariah 14-4 <f>ⓗ</f> On that day his feet shall stand <f>ⓘ</f>on <f>ⓙ</f>the Mount of Olives that lies before Jerusalem on the east, and <f>ⓚ</f>the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by <f>ⓛ</f>a very wide valley, so that one half of the Mount shall move northward, and the other half southward.
Zechariah 14-5 And you shall flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from <f>ⓜ</f>the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him. <f>[1]</f>
Zechariah 14-6 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> On that day <f>ⓞ</f>there shall be <f>ⓟ</f>no light, cold, or frost. <f>[2]</f>
Zechariah 14-7 <f>ⓠ</f> And there shall be a unique <f>[3]</f> day, <f>ⓡ</f>which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but <f>ⓢ</f>at evening time there shall be light.
Zechariah 14-8 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> On that day <f>ⓤ</f>living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to <f>ⓥ</f>the eastern sea <f>[4]</f> and half of them to <f>ⓦ</f>the western sea. <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓧ</f>It shall continue in summer as in winter.
Zechariah 14-9 <pb/>And <f>ⓨ</f>the LORD will be king over all the earth. <f>ⓩ</f>On that day the LORD will be <f>ⓐ</f>one and <f>ⓑ</f>his name one.
Zechariah 14-10 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> The whole land shall be turned into a plain from <f>ⓓ</f>Geba to <f>ⓔ</f>Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But <f>ⓕ</f>Jerusalem shall remain aloft <f>ⓖ</f>on its site from <f>ⓗ</f>the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to <f>ⓘ</f>the Corner Gate, and from <f>ⓙ</f>the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.
Zechariah 14-11 And it shall be inhabited, for <f>ⓚ</f>there shall never again be a decree of utter destruction. <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>Jerusalem shall dwell in security.
Zechariah 14-12 <pb/>And this shall be <f>ⓜ</f>the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
Zechariah 14-13 <pb/>And <f>ⓝ</f>on that day a great panic from the LORD shall fall on them, so that <f>ⓞ</f>each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other.
Zechariah 14-14 Even <f>ⓟ</f>Judah will fight at Jerusalem. <f>[7]</f> And <f>ⓠ</f>the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance.
Zechariah 14-15 And <f>ⓡ</f>a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and whatever beasts may be in those camps.
Zechariah 14-16 <pb/>Then everyone who survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem <f>ⓢ</f>shall go up year after year to worship <f>ⓣ</f>the King, the LORD of hosts, and <f>ⓤ</f>to keep <f>ⓥ</f>the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah 14-17 And if <f>ⓦ</f>any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship <f>ⓧ</f>the King, the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓨ</f>there will be no rain on them.
Zechariah 14-18 And if the family of Egypt does not go up and present themselves, then on them there shall be no rain; <f>[8]</f> there shall be <f>ⓩ</f>the plague with which the LORD afflicts the nations that do not go up <f>ⓐ</f>to keep the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah 14-19 This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up <f>ⓑ</f>to keep the Feast of Booths.
Zechariah 14-20 <pb/>And <f>ⓒ</f>on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, <f>ⓓ</f>“Holy to the LORD.” And the pots in the house of the LORD shall be as the bowls before the altar.
Zechariah 14-21 And every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be <f>ⓔ</f>holy to the LORD of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil the meat of the sacrifice in them. And <f>ⓕ</f>there shall no longer be <f>ⓖ</f>a trader <f>[9]</f> in the house of the LORD of hosts <f>ⓗ</f>on that day.
