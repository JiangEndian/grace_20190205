2 Corinthians 12-1 <pb/>I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and <f>ⓐ</f>revelations of the Lord.
2 Corinthians 12-2 I know a man <f>ⓑ</f>in Christ who fourteen years ago was <f>ⓒ</f>caught up to <f>ⓓ</f>the third heaven — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, <f>ⓔ</f>God knows.
2 Corinthians 12-3 And I know that this man was caught up into <f>ⓕ</f>paradise — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, <f>ⓖ</f>God knows —
2 Corinthians 12-4 and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.
2 Corinthians 12-5 On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, <f>ⓗ</f>except of my weaknesses —
2 Corinthians 12-6 though if I should wish to boast, <f>ⓘ</f>I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.
2 Corinthians 12-7 So <f>ⓙ</f>to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>a thorn was given me in the flesh, <f>ⓛ</f>a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.
2 Corinthians 12-8 <f>ⓜ</f> Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me.
2 Corinthians 12-9 But he said to me, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“My grace is sufficient for you, for <f>ⓞ</f>my power is made perfect in weakness.”</J> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that <f>ⓟ</f>the power of Christ may rest upon me.
2 Corinthians 12-10 <f>ⓠ</f> For the sake of Christ, then, <f>ⓡ</f>I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For <f>ⓢ</f>when I am weak, then I am strong.
2 Corinthians 12-11 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was <f>ⓤ</f>not at all inferior to these super-apostles, <f>ⓥ</f>even though I am nothing.
2 Corinthians 12-12 <f>ⓦ</f> The signs of a true apostle were performed among you <f>ⓧ</f>with utmost patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works.
2 Corinthians 12-13 For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that <f>ⓨ</f>I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!
2 Corinthians 12-14 <pb/>Here <f>ⓩ</f>for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for <f>ⓐ</f>I seek not what is yours but you. For <f>ⓑ</f>children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but <f>ⓒ</f>parents for their children.
2 Corinthians 12-15 <f>ⓓ</f> I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If <f>ⓔ</f>I love you more, am I to be loved less?
2 Corinthians 12-16 But granting that <f>ⓕ</f>I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by deceit.
2 Corinthians 12-17 Did I take advantage of you <f>ⓖ</f>through any of those whom I sent to you?
2 Corinthians 12-18 <f>ⓗ</f> I urged Titus to go, and sent <f>ⓘ</f>the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?
2 Corinthians 12-19 <pb/>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? It is <f>ⓙ</f>in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and <f>ⓚ</f>all for your upbuilding, beloved.
2 Corinthians 12-20 For I fear that perhaps <f>ⓛ</f>when I come I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish — that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder.
2 Corinthians 12-21 I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those <f>ⓜ</f>who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, <f>ⓝ</f>sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced.
