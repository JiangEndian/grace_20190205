Zechariah 3-1 <pb/>Then he showed me <f>ⓐ</f>Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and <f>ⓑ</f>Satan <f>[1]</f> standing at his right hand to accuse him.
Zechariah 3-2 And the LORD said to Satan, <f>ⓒ</f>“The LORD rebuke you, O Satan! The LORD who has <f>ⓓ</f>chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this <f>ⓔ</f>a brand <f>[2]</f> plucked from the fire?”
Zechariah 3-3 Now <f>ⓕ</f>Joshua was standing before the angel, <f>ⓖ</f>clothed with filthy garments.
Zechariah 3-4 And the angel said to <f>ⓗ</f>those who were standing before him, <f>ⓘ</f>“Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him he said, “Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>I have taken your iniquity away from you, and <f>ⓚ</f>I will clothe you with pure vestments.”
Zechariah 3-5 And I said, <f>ⓛ</f>“Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD was standing by.
Zechariah 3-6 <pb/>And the angel of the LORD solemnly assured <f>ⓜ</f>Joshua,
Zechariah 3-7 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and <f>ⓝ</f>keep my charge, then you shall <f>ⓞ</f>rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among <f>ⓟ</f>those who are standing here.
Zechariah 3-8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for <f>ⓠ</f>they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring <f>ⓡ</f>my servant <f>ⓢ</f>the Branch.
Zechariah 3-9 For behold, on <f>ⓣ</f>the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with <f>ⓤ</f>seven eyes, <f>[3]</f> I will <f>ⓥ</f>engrave its inscription, declares the LORD of hosts, and <f>ⓦ</f>I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.
Zechariah 3-10 In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come <f>ⓧ</f>under his vine and under his fig tree.”
