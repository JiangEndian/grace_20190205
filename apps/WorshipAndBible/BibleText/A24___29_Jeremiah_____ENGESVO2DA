Jeremiah 29-1 <pb/>These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to <f>ⓐ</f>the surviving elders of the exiles, and to <f>ⓑ</f>the priests, <f>ⓒ</f>the prophets, and <f>ⓓ</f>all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah 29-2 This was after <f>ⓔ</f>King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 29-3 The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of <f>ⓕ</f>Shaphan and Gemariah the son of <f>ⓖ</f>Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:
Jeremiah 29-4 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
Jeremiah 29-5 <f>ⓗ</f> Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
Jeremiah 29-6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease.
Jeremiah 29-7 But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and <f>ⓘ</f>pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.
Jeremiah 29-8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓙ</f>Do not let your prophets and <f>ⓚ</f>your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream, <f>[1]</f>
Jeremiah 29-9 for <f>ⓛ</f>it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; <f>ⓜ</f>I did not send them, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 29-10 <pb/>“For thus says the LORD: <f>ⓝ</f>When seventy years are completed for Babylon, <f>ⓞ</f>I will visit you, <f>ⓟ</f>and I will fulfill to you my promise <f>ⓠ</f>and bring you back to this place.
Jeremiah 29-11 <f>ⓡ</f> For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare <f>[2]</f> and not for evil, <f>ⓢ</f>to give you a future and a hope.
Jeremiah 29-12 <f>ⓣ</f> Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, <f>ⓤ</f>and I will hear you.
Jeremiah 29-13 <f>ⓥ</f> You will seek me and find me, when you seek me <f>ⓦ</f>with all your heart.
Jeremiah 29-14 I will be found by you, declares the LORD, <f>ⓧ</f>and I will restore your fortunes and <f>ⓨ</f>gather you from all the nations and all the places <f>ⓩ</f>where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.
Jeremiah 29-15 <pb/>“Because you have said, ‘The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’
Jeremiah 29-16 thus says the LORD concerning <f>ⓐ</f>the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile:
Jeremiah 29-17 ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, behold, I am sending on them <f>ⓑ</f>sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like <f>ⓒ</f>vile figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten.
Jeremiah 29-18 I will pursue them with <f>ⓓ</f>sword, famine, and pestilence, <f>ⓔ</f>and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, <f>ⓕ</f>to be a curse, a terror, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations <f>ⓖ</f>where I have driven them,
Jeremiah 29-19 because they did not pay attention to my words, declares the LORD, <f>ⓗ</f>that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen, declares the LORD.’
Jeremiah 29-20 Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles <f>ⓘ</f>whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
Jeremiah 29-21 ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, <f>ⓙ</f>who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your eyes.
Jeremiah 29-22 <f>ⓚ</f> Because of them <f>ⓛ</f>this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: “The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, <f>ⓜ</f>whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,”
Jeremiah 29-23 because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, <f>ⓝ</f>they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and <f>ⓞ</f>they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them. <f>ⓟ</f>I am the one who knows, <f>ⓠ</f>and I am witness, declares the LORD.’”
Jeremiah 29-24 <pb/>To <f>ⓡ</f>Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:
Jeremiah 29-25 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to <f>ⓢ</f>Zephaniah the son of <f>ⓣ</f>Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
Jeremiah 29-26 ‘The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have <f>ⓤ</f>charge in the house of the LORD <f>ⓥ</f>over every madman who prophesies, to put him in <f>ⓦ</f>the stocks and neck irons.
Jeremiah 29-27 Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah <f>ⓧ</f>of Anathoth who is prophesying to you?
Jeremiah 29-28 For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, “Your exile will be long; <f>ⓨ</f>build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce.”’”
Jeremiah 29-29 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah 29-30 <f>ⓐ</f> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 29-31 “Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD concerning <f>ⓑ</f>Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because <f>ⓒ</f>Shemaiah had prophesied to you <f>ⓓ</f>when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie,
Jeremiah 29-32 therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish <f>ⓔ</f>Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants. He shall not have anyone living among this people, <f>ⓕ</f>and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>for he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.’”
