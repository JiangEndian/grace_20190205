Genesis 40-1 <pb/>Some time after this, the <f>ⓐ</f>cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt.
Genesis 40-2 And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
Genesis 40-3 <f>ⓑ</f> and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.
Genesis 40-4 The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody.
Genesis 40-5 <pb/>And one night they both dreamed — the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison — each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation.
Genesis 40-6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.
Genesis 40-7 So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, <f>ⓒ</f>“Why are your faces downcast today?”
Genesis 40-8 They said to him, <f>ⓓ</f>“We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” And Joseph said to them, <f>ⓔ</f>“Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.”
Genesis 40-9 <pb/>So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, “In my dream there was a vine before me,
Genesis 40-10 and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.
Genesis 40-11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.”
Genesis 40-12 Then Joseph said to him, <f>ⓕ</f>“This is its interpretation: <f>ⓖ</f>the three branches are three days.
Genesis 40-13 In three days Pharaoh will <f>ⓗ</f>lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer.
Genesis 40-14 Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.
Genesis 40-15 For <f>ⓘ</f>I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and <f>ⓙ</f>here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.”
Genesis 40-16 <pb/>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,
Genesis 40-17 and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.”
Genesis 40-18 And Joseph answered and said, <f>ⓚ</f>“This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.
Genesis 40-19 <f>ⓛ</f> In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head — from you! — and <f>ⓜ</f>hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you.”
Genesis 40-20 <pb/>On the third day, which was Pharaoh's <f>ⓝ</f>birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and <f>ⓞ</f>lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
Genesis 40-21 <f>ⓟ</f> He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and <f>ⓠ</f>he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.
Genesis 40-22 But he <f>ⓡ</f>hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Genesis 40-23 Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
