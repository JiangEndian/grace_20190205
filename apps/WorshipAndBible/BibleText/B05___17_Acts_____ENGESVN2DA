Acts 17-1 <pb/>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to <f>ⓐ</f>Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Acts 17-2 And Paul went in, <f>ⓑ</f>as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them <f>ⓒ</f>from the Scriptures,
Acts 17-3 <f>ⓓ</f> explaining and proving that it was necessary for <f>ⓔ</f>the Christ to suffer and <f>ⓕ</f>to rise from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.”
Acts 17-4 And <f>ⓖ</f>some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did <f>ⓗ</f>a great many of the devout <f>ⓘ</f>Greeks and not a few of the leading women.
Acts 17-5 <f>ⓙ</f> But the Jews <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>were jealous, and taking <f>ⓛ</f>some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd.
Acts 17-6 And when they could not find them, <f>ⓜ</f>they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
Acts 17-7 and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against <f>ⓝ</f>the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is <f>ⓞ</f>another king, Jesus.”
Acts 17-8 And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things.
Acts 17-9 And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
Acts 17-10 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> The brothers <f>[2]</f> immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they <f>ⓠ</f>went into the Jewish synagogue.
Acts 17-11 Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, <f>ⓡ</f>examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
Acts 17-12 <f>ⓢ</f> Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek <f>ⓣ</f>women of high standing as well as men.
Acts 17-13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, <f>ⓤ</f>agitating and stirring up the crowds.
Acts 17-14 Then the brothers <f>ⓥ</f>immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and <f>ⓦ</f>Timothy remained there.
Acts 17-15 <f>ⓧ</f> Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as <f>ⓨ</f>Athens, and after receiving a command <f>ⓩ</f>for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
Acts 17-16 <pb/>Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was <f>ⓐ</f>provoked within him as he saw that the city was <f>ⓑ</f>full of idols.
Acts 17-17 So <f>ⓒ</f>he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
Acts 17-18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, <f>ⓓ</f>“What does this babbler wish to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities” — because <f>ⓔ</f>he was preaching <f>ⓕ</f>Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts 17-19 And they took him and brought him to <f>ⓖ</f>the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this <f>ⓗ</f>new teaching is that you are presenting?
Acts 17-20 For you bring some <f>ⓘ</f>strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.”
Acts 17-21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.
Acts 17-22 <pb/>So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.
Acts 17-23 For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: <f>ⓙ</f>‘To the unknown god.’ <f>ⓚ</f>What therefore you worship <f>ⓛ</f>as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
Acts 17-24 <f>ⓜ</f> The God who made the world and everything in it, being <f>ⓝ</f>Lord of heaven and earth, <f>ⓞ</f>does not live in temples made by man, <f>[3]</f>
Acts 17-25 nor is he served by human hands, <f>ⓟ</f>as though he needed anything, since he himself <f>ⓠ</f>gives to all mankind <f>ⓡ</f>life and breath and everything.
Acts 17-26 And <f>ⓢ</f>he made from one man every nation of mankind to live <f>ⓣ</f>on all the face of the earth, <f>ⓤ</f>having determined allotted periods and <f>ⓥ</f>the boundaries of their dwelling place,
Acts 17-27 <f>ⓦ</f> that they should seek God, <f>ⓧ</f>and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. <f>ⓨ</f>Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,
Acts 17-28 for <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f>“‘In him we live and move and have our being’; <f>[4]</f> </t> <pb/>as even some of <f>ⓐ</f>your own poets have said, <pb/><t>“‘For we are indeed his offspring.’ <f>[5]</f> </t>
Acts 17-29 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Being then God's offspring, <f>ⓒ</f>we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.
Acts 17-30 <f>ⓓ</f> The times of ignorance <f>ⓔ</f>God overlooked, but <f>ⓕ</f>now he <f>ⓖ</f>commands all people everywhere to repent,
Acts 17-31 because he has fixed <f>ⓗ</f>a day on which <f>ⓘ</f>he will judge the world <f>ⓙ</f>in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and <f>ⓚ</f>of this he has given assurance to all <f>ⓛ</f>by raising him from the dead.”
Acts 17-32 <pb/>Now when they heard of <f>ⓜ</f>the resurrection of the dead, <f>ⓝ</f>some mocked. But others said, <f>ⓞ</f>“We will hear you again about this.”
Acts 17-33 So Paul went out from their midst.
Acts 17-34 But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius <f>ⓟ</f>the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
