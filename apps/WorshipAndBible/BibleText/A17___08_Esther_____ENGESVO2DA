Esther 8-1 <pb/>On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, <f>ⓐ</f>the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told <f>ⓑ</f>what he was to her.
Esther 8-2 <f>ⓒ</f> And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
Esther 8-3 <pb/>Then Esther spoke again to the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman <f>ⓓ</f>the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews.
Esther 8-4 <f>ⓔ</f> When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther, Esther rose and stood before the king.
Esther 8-5 And she said, “If it please the king, <f>ⓕ</f>and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the thing seems right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to revoke <f>ⓖ</f>the letters devised by Haman <f>ⓗ</f>the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king.
Esther 8-6 For how can I bear <f>ⓘ</f>to see the calamity that is coming to my people? Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?”
Esther 8-7 Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, <f>[1]</f> because he intended to lay hands on the Jews.
Esther 8-8 But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, <f>ⓚ</f>and seal it with the king's ring, for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's ring <f>ⓛ</f>cannot be revoked.”
Esther 8-9 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> The king's scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day. And an edict was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, to <f>ⓝ</f>the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces <f>ⓞ</f>from India to Ethiopia, <f>ⓟ</f>127 provinces, <f>ⓠ</f>to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language.
Esther 8-10 <f>ⓡ</f> And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus <f>ⓢ</f>and sealed it with the king's signet ring. Then he sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on <f>ⓣ</f>swift horses that were used in the king's service, bred from the royal stud,
Esther 8-11 saying that the king allowed the Jews who were in every city <f>ⓤ</f>to gather and defend their lives, <f>ⓥ</f>to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, children and women included, <f>ⓦ</f>and to plunder their goods,
Esther 8-12 <f>ⓧ</f> on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
Esther 8-13 <f>ⓨ</f> A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, being publicly displayed to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies.
Esther 8-14 So the couriers, mounted on their <f>ⓩ</f>swift horses that were used in the king's service, rode out hurriedly, urged by the king's command. And the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.
Esther 8-15 <pb/>Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king <f>ⓐ</f>in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓑ</f>a robe of fine linen and purple, <f>ⓒ</f>and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.
Esther 8-16 The Jews had <f>ⓓ</f>light and gladness and joy and honor.
Esther 8-17 And in every province and in every city, wherever the king's command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and <f>ⓔ</f>a holiday. <f>ⓕ</f>And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, <f>ⓖ</f>for fear of the Jews had fallen on them.
