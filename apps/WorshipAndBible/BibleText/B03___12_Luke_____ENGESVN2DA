Luke 12-1 <pb/>In the meantime, <f>ⓐ</f>when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“Beware of <f>ⓒ</f>the leaven of the Pharisees, <f>ⓓ</f>which is hypocrisy.</J>
Luke 12-2 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.</J>
Luke 12-3 <J>Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in <f>ⓕ</f>private rooms shall be proclaimed on <f>ⓖ</f>the housetops.</J>
Luke 12-4 <pb/><J>“I tell you, my friends, <f>ⓗ</f>do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do.</J>
Luke 12-5 <J>But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him <f>ⓘ</f>who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. <f>[1]</f> Yes, I tell you, fear him!</J>
Luke 12-6 <J>Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? <f>[2]</f> And <f>ⓙ</f>not one of them is forgotten before God.</J>
Luke 12-7 <J>Why, <f>ⓚ</f>even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; <f>ⓛ</f>you are of more value than many sparrows.</J>
Luke 12-8 <pb/><J>“And I tell you, <f>ⓜ</f>everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge <f>ⓝ</f>before the angels of God,</J>
Luke 12-9 <J>but <f>ⓞ</f>the one who denies me before men <f>ⓟ</f>will be denied <f>ⓠ</f>before the angels of God.</J>
Luke 12-10 <J>And <f>ⓡ</f>everyone who speaks a word <f>ⓢ</f>against the Son of Man <f>ⓣ</f>will be forgiven, but the one who <f>ⓤ</f>blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</J>
Luke 12-11 <J><f>ⓥ</f> And when they <f>ⓦ</f>bring you before the synagogues and <f>ⓧ</f>the rulers and <f>ⓨ</f>the authorities, <f>ⓩ</f>do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say,</J>
Luke 12-12 <J><f>ⓐ</f> for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.”</J>
Luke 12-13 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
Luke 12-14 But he said to him, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“Man, <f>ⓓ</f>who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?”</J>
Luke 12-15 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”</J>
Luke 12-16 And he told them a parable, saying, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“The land of a rich man produced plentifully,</J>
Luke 12-17 <J>and he thought to himself, <f>ⓖ</f>‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’</J>
Luke 12-18 <J>And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my <f>ⓗ</f>barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</J>
Luke 12-19 <J>And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up <f>ⓘ</f>for many years; relax, <f>ⓙ</f>eat, drink, be merry.”’</J>
Luke 12-20 <J>But God said to him, <f>ⓚ</f>‘Fool! <f>ⓛ</f>This night <f>ⓜ</f>your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, <f>ⓝ</f>whose will they be?’</J>
Luke 12-21 <J>So is the one <f>ⓞ</f>who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”</J>
Luke 12-22 <pb/>And he said to his disciples, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Therefore I tell you, <f>ⓠ</f>do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on.</J>
Luke 12-23 <J>For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.</J>
Luke 12-24 <J><f>ⓡ</f> Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. <f>ⓢ</f>Of how much more value are you than the birds!</J>
Luke 12-25 <J>And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his <f>ⓣ</f>span of life? <f>[3]</f></J>
Luke 12-26 <J>If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest?</J>
Luke 12-27 <J>Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, <f>[4]</f> yet I tell you, <f>ⓤ</f>even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</J>
Luke 12-28 <J>But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, <f>ⓥ</f>O you of little faith!</J>
Luke 12-29 <J>And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor <f>ⓦ</f>be worried.</J>
Luke 12-30 <J>For <f>ⓧ</f>all the nations of the world seek after these things, and <f>ⓨ</f>your Father knows that you need them.</J>
Luke 12-31 <J>Instead, <f>ⓩ</f>seek <f>ⓐ</f>his <f>[5]</f> kingdom, <f>ⓑ</f>and these things will be added to you.</J>
Luke 12-32 <pb/><J><f>ⓒ</f> “Fear not, little <f>ⓓ</f>flock, for <f>ⓔ</f>it is your Father's good pleasure to give you <f>ⓕ</f>the kingdom.</J>
Luke 12-33 <J><f>ⓖ</f> Sell your possessions, and <f>ⓗ</f>give to the needy. <f>ⓘ</f>Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with <f>ⓙ</f>a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.</J>
Luke 12-34 <J><f>ⓚ</f> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</J>
Luke 12-35 <pb/><J><f>ⓛ</f> “Stay dressed for action <f>[6]</f> and <f>ⓜ</f>keep your lamps burning,</J>
Luke 12-36 <J>and be like men who are <f>ⓝ</f>waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and <f>ⓞ</f>knocks.</J>
Luke 12-37 <J><f>ⓟ</f> Blessed are those servants <f>[7]</f> whom the master finds <f>ⓠ</f>awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓡ</f>he will dress himself for service and <f>ⓢ</f>have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them.</J>
Luke 12-38 <J>If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!</J>
Luke 12-39 <J><f>ⓣ</f> But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour <f>ⓤ</f>the thief was coming, he <f>[8]</f> would not have left his house to be broken into.</J>
Luke 12-40 <J>You also must be <f>ⓥ</f>ready, for <f>ⓦ</f>the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”</J>
Luke 12-41 <pb/>Peter said, “Lord, <f>ⓧ</f>are you telling this parable for us or for all?”
Luke 12-42 And the Lord said, <J>“Who then is <f>ⓨ</f>the faithful and <f>ⓩ</f>wise <f>ⓐ</f>manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?</J>
Luke 12-43 <J><f>ⓑ</f> Blessed is that servant <f>[9]</f> whom his master will find so doing when he comes.</J>
Luke 12-44 <J>Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓒ</f>he will set him over all his possessions.</J>
Luke 12-45 <J>But if that servant says to himself, ‘My master <f>ⓓ</f>is delayed in coming,’ and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and <f>ⓔ</f>get drunk,</J>
Luke 12-46 <J>the master of that servant will come <f>ⓕ</f>on a day when he does not expect him and <f>ⓖ</f>at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful.</J>
Luke 12-47 <J><f>ⓗ</f> And that servant who <f>ⓘ</f>knew his master's will but <f>ⓙ</f>did not get ready <f>ⓚ</f>or act according to his will, will receive a <f>ⓛ</f>severe beating.</J>
Luke 12-48 <J><f>ⓜ</f> But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, <f>ⓝ</f>will receive a light beating. <f>ⓞ</f>Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.</J>
Luke 12-49 <pb/><J><f>ⓟ</f> “I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled!</J>
Luke 12-50 <J><f>ⓠ</f> I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how <f>ⓡ</f>great is my distress until it is accomplished!</J>
Luke 12-51 <J><f>ⓢ</f> Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? <f>ⓣ</f>No, I tell you, but rather division.</J>
Luke 12-52 <J>For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three.</J>
Luke 12-53 <J>They will be divided, <f>ⓤ</f>father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”</J>
Luke 12-54 <pb/>He also said to the crowds, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“When you see <f>ⓦ</f>a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, ‘A shower is coming.’ And so it happens.</J>
Luke 12-55 <J>And <f>ⓧ</f>when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be <f>ⓨ</f>scorching heat,’ and it happens.</J>
Luke 12-56 <J>You hypocrites! <f>ⓩ</f>You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?</J>
Luke 12-57 <pb/><J>“And why <f>ⓐ</f>do you not judge <f>ⓑ</f>for yourselves what is right?</J>
Luke 12-58 <J><f>ⓒ</f> As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison.</J>
Luke 12-59 <J>I tell you, <f>ⓓ</f>you will never get out until you have paid the very last <f>ⓔ</f>penny.” <f>[10]</f></J>
