1 Corinthians 13-1 <pb/>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
1 Corinthians 13-2 And if I have <f>ⓐ</f>prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, <f>ⓑ</f>so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
1 Corinthians 13-3 <f>ⓒ</f> If I give away all I have, and <f>ⓓ</f>if I deliver up my body to be burned, <f>[1]</f> but have not love, I gain nothing.
1 Corinthians 13-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Love is patient and <f>ⓕ</f>kind; love <f>ⓖ</f>does not envy or boast; it <f>ⓗ</f>is not arrogant
1 Corinthians 13-5 or rude. It <f>ⓘ</f>does not insist on its own way; it <f>ⓙ</f>is not irritable or resentful; <f>[2]</f>
1 Corinthians 13-6 it <f>ⓚ</f>does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but <f>ⓛ</f>rejoices with the truth.
1 Corinthians 13-7 <f>ⓜ</f> Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, <f>ⓝ</f>endures all things.
1 Corinthians 13-8 <pb/>Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
1 Corinthians 13-9 For <f>ⓞ</f>we know in part and we prophesy in part,
1 Corinthians 13-10 but <f>ⓟ</f>when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
1 Corinthians 13-11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
1 Corinthians 13-12 For <f>ⓠ</f>now we see in a mirror dimly, but <f>ⓡ</f>then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as <f>ⓢ</f>I have been fully known.
1 Corinthians 13-13 <pb/>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
