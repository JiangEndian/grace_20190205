Zechariah 2-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, <f>ⓐ</f>a man with a measuring line in his hand!
Zechariah 2-2 Then I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, <f>ⓑ</f>“To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”
Zechariah 2-3 And behold, <f>ⓒ</f>the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him
Zechariah 2-4 and said to him, “Run, say to that young man, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited <f>ⓔ</f>as villages without walls, because of <f>ⓕ</f>the multitude of people and livestock in it.
Zechariah 2-5 And I will be to her <f>ⓖ</f>a wall of fire all around, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory in her midst.’”
Zechariah 2-6 <pb/>Up! Up! <f>ⓗ</f>Flee from the land of the north, declares the LORD. For I have <f>ⓘ</f>spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, declares the LORD.
Zechariah 2-7 <f>ⓙ</f> Up! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
Zechariah 2-8 For thus said the LORD of hosts, after his glory sent me <f>[2]</f> to the nations who plundered you, <f>ⓚ</f>for he who touches you touches <f>ⓛ</f>the apple of his eye:
Zechariah 2-9 “Behold, <f>ⓜ</f>I will shake my hand over them, <f>ⓝ</f>and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then <f>ⓞ</f>you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.
Zechariah 2-10 <f>ⓟ</f> Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for <f>ⓠ</f>behold, I come <f>ⓡ</f>and I will dwell in your midst, declares the LORD.
Zechariah 2-11 <f>ⓢ</f> And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people. <f>ⓣ</f>And I will dwell in your midst, and <f>ⓤ</f>you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
Zechariah 2-12 <f>ⓥ</f> And the LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again <f>ⓦ</f>choose Jerusalem.”
Zechariah 2-13 <pb/>Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.
