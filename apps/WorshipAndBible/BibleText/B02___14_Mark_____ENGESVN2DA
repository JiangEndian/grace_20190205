Mark 14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> It was now two days before <f>ⓑ</f>the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes <f>ⓒ</f>were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him,
Mark 14-2 for they said, “Not during the feast, <f>ⓓ</f>lest there be an uproar from the people.”
Mark 14-3 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> And while he was at <f>ⓕ</f>Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, <f>[1]</f> as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head.
Mark 14-4 There were some who said to themselves indignantly, “Why was the ointment wasted like that?
Mark 14-5 For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>given to the poor.” And they <f>ⓗ</f>scolded her.
Mark 14-6 But Jesus said, <J>“Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</J>
Mark 14-7 <J>For <f>ⓘ</f>you always have the poor with you, and whenever <f>ⓙ</f>you want, you can do good for them. But <f>ⓚ</f>you will not always have me.</J>
Mark 14-8 <J><f>ⓛ</f> She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand <f>ⓜ</f>for burial.</J>
Mark 14-9 <J>And truly, I say to you, wherever <f>ⓝ</f>the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told <f>ⓞ</f>in memory of her.”</J>
Mark 14-10 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Then <f>ⓠ</f>Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, <f>ⓡ</f>went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
Mark 14-11 And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to <f>ⓢ</f>betray him.
Mark 14-12 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> And on <f>ⓤ</f>the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they <f>ⓥ</f>sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
Mark 14-13 And he sent <f>ⓦ</f>two of his disciples and said to them, <J>“Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,</J>
Mark 14-14 <J>and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, <f>ⓧ</f>‘The Teacher says, Where is <f>ⓨ</f>my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</J>
Mark 14-15 <J>And he will show you <f>ⓩ</f>a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.”</J>
Mark 14-16 And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
Mark 14-17 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And when it was evening, he came with the twelve.
Mark 14-18 And as they were reclining at table and eating, <f>ⓑ</f>Jesus said, <J>“Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, <f>ⓒ</f>one who is eating with me.”</J>
Mark 14-19 They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?”
Mark 14-20 He said to them, <J>“It is <f>ⓓ</f>one of the twelve, <f>ⓔ</f>one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.</J>
Mark 14-21 <J>For the Son of Man goes <f>ⓕ</f>as it is written of him, but <f>ⓖ</f>woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! <f>ⓗ</f>It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”</J>
Mark 14-22 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> And as they were eating, he took bread, and after <f>ⓙ</f>blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, <J>“Take; <f>ⓚ</f>this is my body.”</J>
Mark 14-23 And he took a cup, and when he had <f>ⓛ</f>given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.
Mark 14-24 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“This is my <f>ⓝ</f>blood of the <f>[3]</f> covenant, which is poured out for <f>ⓞ</f>many.</J>
Mark 14-25 <J>Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</J>
Mark 14-26 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> And when they had sung a hymn, <f>ⓠ</f>they went out to <f>ⓡ</f>the Mount of Olives.
Mark 14-27 And Jesus said to them, <J>“You will all fall away, for it is written, ‘I will <f>ⓢ</f>strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’</J>
Mark 14-28 <J>But after I am raised up, <f>ⓣ</f>I will go before you to Galilee.”</J>
Mark 14-29 <f>ⓤ</f> Peter said to him, “Even though they all fall away, I will not.”
Mark 14-30 And <f>ⓥ</f>Jesus said to him, <J>“Truly, I tell you, this very night, before <f>ⓦ</f>the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”</J>
Mark 14-31 But <f>ⓧ</f>he said emphatically, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all said the same.
Mark 14-32 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> And they went <f>ⓩ</f>to a place called Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples, <J>“Sit here while I pray.”</J>
Mark 14-33 And he took with him <f>ⓐ</f>Peter and James and John, and began <f>ⓑ</f>to be greatly distressed and troubled.
Mark 14-34 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and <f>ⓓ</f>watch.” <f>[4]</f></J>
Mark 14-35 And going a little farther, he fell on the ground <f>ⓔ</f>and prayed that, if it were possible, <f>ⓕ</f>the hour might pass from him.
Mark 14-36 And he said, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Abba, Father, <f>ⓗ</f>all things are possible for you. Remove <f>ⓘ</f>this cup from me. <f>ⓙ</f>Yet not what I will, but what you will.”</J>
Mark 14-37 And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, <J>“Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</J>
Mark 14-38 <J><f>ⓚ</f> Watch and <f>ⓛ</f>pray that you may not <f>ⓜ</f>enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</J>
Mark 14-39 And again he went away and prayed, <f>ⓝ</f>saying the same words.
Mark 14-40 And again he came and found them sleeping, for <f>ⓞ</f>their eyes were very heavy, and <f>ⓟ</f>they did not know what to answer him.
Mark 14-41 And he came the third time and said to them, <J>“Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? <f>ⓠ</f>It is enough; <f>ⓡ</f>the hour has come. <f>ⓢ</f>The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</J>
Mark 14-42 <J>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”</J>
Mark 14-43 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> And immediately, while he was still speaking, <f>ⓤ</f>Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark 14-44 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard.”
Mark 14-45 And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, <f>ⓥ</f>“Rabbi!” And he <f>ⓦ</f>kissed him.
Mark 14-46 And they laid hands on him and seized him.
Mark 14-47 But one of those who stood by drew his <f>ⓧ</f>sword and struck the servant <f>[5]</f> of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Mark 14-48 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?</J>
Mark 14-49 <J><f>ⓨ</f> Day after day I was with you in the temple <f>ⓩ</f>teaching, and you did not seize me. But <f>ⓐ</f>let the Scriptures be fulfilled.”</J>
Mark 14-50 <f>ⓑ</f> And they all left him and fled.
Mark 14-51 <pb/>And a young man followed him, with nothing but <f>ⓒ</f>a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him,
Mark 14-52 but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
Mark 14-53 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> And <f>ⓔ</f>they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.
Mark 14-54 <f>ⓕ</f> And <f>ⓖ</f>Peter had followed him at a distance, <f>ⓗ</f>right into <f>ⓘ</f>the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with <f>ⓙ</f>the guards and <f>ⓚ</f>warming himself at the fire.
Mark 14-55 Now the chief priests and the whole council <f>[6]</f> were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.
Mark 14-56 <f>ⓛ</f> For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony <f>ⓜ</f>did not agree.
Mark 14-57 And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
Mark 14-58 <f>ⓝ</f> “We heard him say, <f>ⓞ</f>‘I will destroy this temple <f>ⓟ</f>that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, <f>ⓠ</f>not made with hands.’”
Mark 14-59 Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.
Mark 14-60 And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?” <f>[7]</f>
Mark 14-61 But <f>ⓡ</f>he remained silent and made no answer. <f>ⓢ</f>Again the high priest asked him, “Are you <f>ⓣ</f>the Christ, the Son of <f>ⓤ</f>the Blessed?”
Mark 14-62 And Jesus said, <J>“I am, and <f>ⓥ</f>you will see the Son of Man <f>ⓦ</f>seated at the right hand of Power, and <f>ⓧ</f>coming with the clouds of heaven.”</J>
Mark 14-63 And the high priest <f>ⓨ</f>tore his garments and said, “What further witnesses do we need?
Mark 14-64 You have heard <f>ⓩ</f>his blasphemy. What is your decision?” And they <f>ⓐ</f>all condemned him as <f>ⓑ</f>deserving death.
Mark 14-65 <f>ⓒ</f> And some began <f>ⓓ</f>to spit on him and <f>ⓔ</f>to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards received him <f>ⓕ</f>with blows.
Mark 14-66 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,
Mark 14-67 and seeing Peter <f>ⓗ</f>warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”
Mark 14-68 But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean.” And he went out into the gateway <f>[8]</f> and <f>ⓘ</f>the rooster crowed. <f>[9]</f>
Mark 14-69 And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”
Mark 14-70 But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, “Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.”
Mark 14-71 But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak.”
Mark 14-72 And immediately the rooster crowed <f>ⓙ</f>a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“Before the rooster crows twice, you will <f>ⓛ</f>deny me three times.”</J> And he broke down and wept. <f>[10]</f>
