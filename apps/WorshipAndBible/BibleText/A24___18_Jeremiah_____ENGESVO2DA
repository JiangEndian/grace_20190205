Jeremiah 18-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 18-2 “Arise, and go down to <f>ⓐ</f>the potter's house, and there I will let you hear <f>[1]</f> my words.”
Jeremiah 18-3 So I went down to <f>ⓑ</f>the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel.
Jeremiah 18-4 And the vessel he was making of clay was <f>ⓒ</f>spoiled in the potter's hand, and <f>ⓓ</f>he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do.
Jeremiah 18-5 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah 18-6 “O house of Israel, <f>ⓔ</f>can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. <f>ⓕ</f>Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
Jeremiah 18-7 If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will <f>ⓖ</f>pluck up and break down and destroy it,
Jeremiah 18-8 and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, <f>ⓗ</f>turns from its evil, <f>ⓘ</f>I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it.
Jeremiah 18-9 And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will <f>ⓙ</f>build and plant it,
Jeremiah 18-10 and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it.
Jeremiah 18-11 Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the LORD, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. <f>ⓚ</f>Return, every one from his evil way, and <f>ⓛ</f>amend your ways and your deeds.’
Jeremiah 18-12 <pb/>“But they say, <f>ⓜ</f>‘That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to <f>ⓝ</f>the stubbornness of his evil heart.’
Jeremiah 18-13 <pb/><t>“Therefore thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Ask among the nations, </t><t>Who has heard the like of this? </t><t>The virgin Israel </t><t>has done <f>ⓟ</f>a very horrible thing.</t>
Jeremiah 18-14 <t>Does the snow of Lebanon leave </t><t>the crags of Sirion? <f>[2]</f> </t><t>Do the mountain waters run dry, <f>[3]</f> </t><t>the cold flowing streams?</t>
Jeremiah 18-15 <t><f>ⓠ</f> But my people have forgotten me; </t><t>they make offerings to <f>ⓡ</f>false gods; </t><t>they made them stumble in their ways, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>in the ancient roads, </t><t>and to walk into side roads, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>not the highway,</t>
Jeremiah 18-16 <t>making their land <f>ⓤ</f>a horror, </t><t>a thing <f>ⓥ</f>to be hissed at forever. </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>Everyone who passes by it is horrified </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and shakes his head.</t>
Jeremiah 18-17 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Like the east wind <f>ⓩ</f>I will scatter them </t><t>before the enemy. </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>I will show them my back, not my face, </t><t>in the day of their calamity.” </t>
Jeremiah 18-18 <pb/>Then they said, <f>ⓑ</f>“Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, <f>ⓒ</f>for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. <f>ⓓ</f>Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.”
Jeremiah 18-19 <pb/><t>Hear me, O LORD, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>listen to the voice of my adversaries.</t>
Jeremiah 18-20 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Should good be repaid with evil? </t><t>Yet <f>ⓖ</f>they have dug a pit for my life. </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>Remember how I stood before you </t><t>to speak good for them, </t><t>to turn away your wrath from them.</t>
Jeremiah 18-21 <t>Therefore <f>ⓘ</f>deliver up their children to famine; </t><t>give them over to the power of the sword; </t><t>let their wives become childless <f>ⓙ</f>and widowed. </t><t>May their men meet death by pestilence, </t><t>their youths be struck down by the sword in battle.</t>
Jeremiah 18-22 <t><f>ⓚ</f> May a cry be heard from their houses, </t><t>when you bring the plunderer suddenly upon them! </t><t>For <f>ⓛ</f>they have dug a pit to take me </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and laid snares for my feet.</t>
Jeremiah 18-23 <t>Yet <f>ⓝ</f>you, O LORD, know </t><t>all their plotting to kill me. </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Forgive not their iniquity, </t><t>nor blot out their sin from your sight. </t><t>Let them be overthrown before you; </t><t>deal with them in the time of your anger. </t>
