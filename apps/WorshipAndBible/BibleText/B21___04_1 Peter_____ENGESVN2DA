1 Peter 4-1 <pb/>Since therefore <f>ⓐ</f>Christ suffered in the flesh, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for <f>ⓒ</f>whoever has suffered in the flesh <f>ⓓ</f>has ceased from sin,
1 Peter 4-2 <f>ⓔ</f> so as to live for <f>ⓕ</f>the rest of the time in the flesh <f>ⓖ</f>no longer for human passions but <f>ⓗ</f>for the will of God.
1 Peter 4-3 For the time that is past <f>ⓘ</f>suffices <f>ⓙ</f>for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.
1 Peter 4-4 With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of <f>ⓚ</f>debauchery, and <f>ⓛ</f>they malign you;
1 Peter 4-5 but they will give account to him who is ready <f>ⓜ</f>to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter 4-6 For this is why <f>ⓝ</f>the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.
1 Peter 4-7 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> The end of all things is at hand; therefore <f>ⓟ</f>be self-controlled and sober-minded <f>ⓠ</f>for the sake of your prayers.
1 Peter 4-8 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since <f>ⓡ</f>love covers a multitude of sins.
1 Peter 4-9 <f>ⓢ</f> Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
1 Peter 4-10 <f>ⓣ</f> As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, <f>ⓤ</f>as good stewards of God's varied grace:
1 Peter 4-11 whoever speaks, as one who speaks <f>ⓥ</f>oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves <f>ⓦ</f>by the strength that God supplies — in order that in everything <f>ⓧ</f>God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. <f>ⓨ</f>To him belong glory and <f>ⓩ</f>dominion forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter 4-12 <pb/>Beloved, do not be surprised at <f>ⓐ</f>the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
1 Peter 4-13 But rejoice <f>ⓑ</f>insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad <f>ⓒ</f>when his glory is revealed.
1 Peter 4-14 <f>ⓓ</f> If you are insulted <f>ⓔ</f>for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory <f>[2]</f> and of God rests upon you.
1 Peter 4-15 But <f>ⓕ</f>let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or <f>ⓖ</f>as a meddler.
1 Peter 4-16 Yet <f>ⓗ</f>if anyone suffers as a <f>ⓘ</f>Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God <f>ⓙ</f>in that name.
1 Peter 4-17 For it is time for judgment <f>ⓚ</f>to begin at the household of God; and <f>ⓛ</f>if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who <f>ⓜ</f>do not obey the gospel of God?
1 Peter 4-18 And <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“If the righteous is scarcely saved, </t><t>what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?” <f>[3]</f> </t>
1 Peter 4-19 <pb/>Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will <f>ⓞ</f>entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.
