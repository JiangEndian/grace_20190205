Ezekiel 31-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 31-2 <f>ⓑ</f> “Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to <f>ⓒ</f>his multitude: <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“Whom are you like in your greatness?</t>
Ezekiel 31-3 <t>Behold, <f>ⓔ</f>Assyria was a <f>ⓕ</f>cedar in <f>ⓖ</f>Lebanon, </t><t>with beautiful branches and <f>ⓗ</f>forest shade, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>and of towering height, </t><t>its top among the clouds. <f>[1]</f></t>
Ezekiel 31-4 <t>The waters nourished it; </t><t>the deep made it grow tall, </t><t>making <f>ⓙ</f>its rivers flow </t><t>around the place of its planting, </t><t>sending forth its streams </t><t>to all the trees of the field.</t>
Ezekiel 31-5 <t>So <f>ⓚ</f>it towered high </t><t>above all the trees of the field; </t><t>its boughs grew large </t><t>and its branches long </t><t>from <f>ⓛ</f>abundant water in its shoots.</t>
Ezekiel 31-6 <t><f>ⓜ</f> All the birds of the heavens </t><t>made their nests in its boughs; </t><t>under its branches all the beasts of the field </t><t>gave birth to their young, </t><t>and under its shadow </t><t>lived all great nations.</t>
Ezekiel 31-7 <t>It was <f>ⓝ</f>beautiful in its greatness, </t><t>in the length of its branches; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>for its roots went down </t><t>to abundant waters.</t>
Ezekiel 31-8 <t><f>ⓟ</f> The cedars <f>ⓠ</f>in the garden of God could not rival it, </t><t>nor the fir trees equal its boughs; </t><t>neither were the plane trees </t><t>like its branches; </t><t>no tree <f>ⓡ</f>in the garden of God </t><t>was its equal in beauty.</t>
Ezekiel 31-9 <t>I made it beautiful </t><t>in the mass of its branches, </t><t>and all the trees of <f>ⓢ</f>Eden envied it, </t><t>that were in the garden of God. </t>
Ezekiel 31-10 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓣ</f>it <f>[2]</f> towered high and set its top among the clouds, <f>[3]</f> and <f>ⓤ</f>its heart was proud of its height,
Ezekiel 31-11 I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out.
Ezekiel 31-12 <f>ⓥ</f> Foreigners, <f>ⓦ</f>the most ruthless of nations, have cut it down and left it. <f>ⓧ</f>On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs have been broken in all <f>ⓨ</f>the ravines of the land, and <f>ⓩ</f>all the peoples of the earth have gone away from its shadow and left it.
Ezekiel 31-13 <f>ⓐ</f> On its fallen trunk dwell all the birds of the heavens, and on its branches are all the beasts of the field.
Ezekiel 31-14 <f>ⓑ</f> All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to towering height or set their tops among the clouds, <f>[4]</f> and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height. For they are all given over to death, <f>ⓒ</f>to the world <f>ⓓ</f>below, among the children of man, <f>[5]</f> with those who go down to the pit.
Ezekiel 31-15 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day <f>ⓔ</f>the cedar <f>[6]</f> went down to Sheol I caused mourning; I closed the deep over it, and restrained its rivers, and many waters were stopped. I clothed Lebanon in gloom for it, and all the trees of the field fainted because of it.
Ezekiel 31-16 <f>ⓕ</f> I made the nations quake at the sound of its fall, <f>ⓖ</f>when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the pit. <f>ⓗ</f>And all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, <f>ⓘ</f>were comforted in the world below.
Ezekiel 31-17 They also went down to Sheol with it, <f>ⓙ</f>to those who are slain by the sword; yes, <f>ⓚ</f>those who were its arm, <f>ⓛ</f>who lived under its shadow among the nations.
Ezekiel 31-18 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> “Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness <f>ⓝ</f>among the trees of Eden? <f>ⓞ</f>You shall be brought down with <f>ⓟ</f>the trees of Eden to the world below. <f>ⓠ</f>You shall lie among the uncircumcised, <f>ⓡ</f>with those who are slain by the sword. <pb/><f>ⓢ</f>“This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord GOD.”
