Luke 16-1 <pb/>He also said to the disciples, <J>“There was a rich man who had <f>ⓐ</f>a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions.</J>
Luke 16-2 <J>And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your <f>ⓑ</f>management, for you can no longer be manager.’</J>
Luke 16-3 <J>And the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</J>
Luke 16-4 <J>I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.’</J>

Luke 16-6 <J>He said, ‘A hundred measures <f>[1]</f> of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’</J>
Luke 16-7 <J>Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred measures <f>[2]</f> of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’</J>
Luke 16-8 <J>The master commended the dishonest manager for his <f>ⓒ</f>shrewdness. For <f>ⓓ</f>the sons of this world <f>[3]</f> are <f>ⓔ</f>more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than <f>ⓕ</f>the sons of light.</J>
Luke 16-9 <J>And I tell you, <f>ⓖ</f>make friends for yourselves by means of <f>ⓗ</f>unrighteous wealth, <f>[4]</f> so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</J>
Luke 16-10 <pb/><J><f>ⓘ</f> “One who is <f>ⓙ</f>faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.</J>
Luke 16-11 <J>If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?</J>
Luke 16-12 <J>And if you have not been faithful in <f>ⓚ</f>that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?</J>
Luke 16-13 <J><f>ⓛ</f> No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.”</J>
Luke 16-14 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> The Pharisees, who were <f>ⓝ</f>lovers of money, heard all these things, and they <f>ⓞ</f>ridiculed him.
Luke 16-15 And he said to them, <J>“You are those who <f>ⓟ</f>justify yourselves before men, but <f>ⓠ</f>God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men <f>ⓡ</f>is an abomination in the sight of God.</J>
Luke 16-16 <pb/><J><f>ⓢ</f> “The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then <f>ⓣ</f>the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and <f>ⓤ</f>everyone forces his way into it. <f>[5]</f></J>
Luke 16-17 <J>But <f>ⓥ</f>it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to become void.</J>
Luke 16-18 <pb/><J><f>ⓦ</f> “Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.</J>
Luke 16-19 <pb/><J>“There was a rich man who was clothed in <f>ⓧ</f>purple and fine linen and <f>ⓨ</f>who feasted sumptuously every day.</J>
Luke 16-20 <J>And at his gate <f>ⓩ</f>was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,</J>
Luke 16-21 <J>who desired to be fed with <f>ⓐ</f>what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.</J>
Luke 16-22 <J>The poor man died and was carried by <f>ⓑ</f>the angels <f>ⓒ</f>to Abraham's side. <f>[6]</f> The rich man also died and was buried,</J>
Luke 16-23 <J>and in <f>ⓓ</f>Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and <f>ⓔ</f>saw Abraham far off and Lazarus <f>ⓕ</f>at his side.</J>
Luke 16-24 <J>And he called out, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and <f>ⓗ</f>cool my tongue, for <f>ⓘ</f>I am in anguish in this flame.’</J>
Luke 16-25 <J>But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that <f>ⓙ</f>you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.</J>
Luke 16-26 <J>And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’</J>
Luke 16-27 <J>And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house — </J>
Luke 16-28 <J>for I have five brothers — so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’</J>
Luke 16-29 <J>But Abraham said, ‘They have <f>ⓚ</f>Moses and the Prophets; <f>ⓛ</f>let them hear them.’</J>
Luke 16-30 <J>And he said, ‘No, <f>ⓜ</f>father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’</J>
Luke 16-31 <J>He said to him, ‘If they do not hear <f>ⓝ</f>Moses and the Prophets, <f>ⓞ</f>neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’”</J>
