Romans 2-1 <pb/>Therefore you have <f>ⓐ</f>no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For <f>ⓑ</f>in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.
Romans 2-2 We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.
Romans 2-3 Do you suppose, O man — you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself — that you will escape the judgment of God?
Romans 2-4 Or do you presume on <f>ⓒ</f>the riches of his kindness and <f>ⓓ</f>forbearance and <f>ⓔ</f>patience, <f>ⓕ</f>not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
Romans 2-5 But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are <f>ⓖ</f>storing up <f>ⓗ</f>wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
Romans 2-6 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> He will render to each one according to his works:
Romans 2-7 to those who <f>ⓙ</f>by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;
Romans 2-8 but for those who are self-seeking <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓚ</f>do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.
Romans 2-9 There will be tribulation and distress <f>ⓛ</f>for every human being who does evil, the Jew <f>ⓜ</f>first and also the Greek,
Romans 2-10 but glory and honor and <f>ⓝ</f>peace for everyone who does good, <f>ⓞ</f>the Jew first and also the Greek.
Romans 2-11 For <f>ⓟ</f>God shows no partiality.
Romans 2-12 <pb/>For all who have sinned <f>ⓠ</f>without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
Romans 2-13 For <f>ⓡ</f>it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.
Romans 2-14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, <f>ⓢ</f>by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
Romans 2-15 They show that the work of the law is <f>ⓣ</f>written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them
Romans 2-16 <f>ⓤ</f> on that day when, <f>ⓥ</f>according to my gospel, God judges <f>ⓦ</f>the secrets of men <f>ⓧ</f>by Christ Jesus.
Romans 2-17 <pb/>But if you call yourself a Jew and <f>ⓨ</f>rely on the law and boast in God
Romans 2-18 and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;
Romans 2-19 and if you are sure that you yourself are <f>ⓩ</f>a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
Romans 2-20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law <f>ⓐ</f>the embodiment of <f>ⓑ</f>knowledge and truth —
Romans 2-21 <f>ⓒ</f> you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?
Romans 2-22 You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you <f>ⓓ</f>rob temples?
Romans 2-23 You who <f>ⓔ</f>boast in the law <f>ⓕ</f>dishonor God by breaking the law.
Romans 2-24 For, <f>ⓖ</f>as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed <f>ⓗ</f>among the Gentiles because of you.”
Romans 2-25 <pb/>For circumcision indeed is of value <f>ⓘ</f>if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
Romans 2-26 So, if <f>ⓙ</f>a man who is uncircumcised keeps <f>ⓚ</f>the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded <f>[2]</f> as circumcision?
Romans 2-27 Then he who is physically <f>[3]</f> uncircumcised but keeps the law <f>ⓛ</f>will condemn you who have <f>ⓜ</f>the written code <f>[4]</f> and circumcision but break the law.
Romans 2-28 For <f>ⓝ</f>no one is a Jew <f>ⓞ</f>who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.
Romans 2-29 But a Jew is one <f>ⓟ</f>inwardly, and <f>ⓠ</f>circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. <f>ⓡ</f>His praise is not from man but from God.
