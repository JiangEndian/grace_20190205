1 Thessalonians 3-1 <pb/>Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing <f>ⓐ</f>to be left behind at Athens alone,
1 Thessalonians 3-2 and we <f>ⓑ</f>sent Timothy, <f>ⓒ</f>our brother and God's coworker <f>[1]</f> in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you in your faith,
1 Thessalonians 3-3 that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that <f>ⓓ</f>we are destined for this.
1 Thessalonians 3-4 For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, <f>ⓔ</f>just as it has come to pass, and just as you know.
1 Thessalonians 3-5 For this reason, <f>ⓕ</f>when I could bear it no longer, <f>ⓖ</f>I sent to learn about your faith, <f>ⓗ</f>for fear that somehow <f>ⓘ</f>the tempter had tempted you and <f>ⓙ</f>our labor would be in vain.
1 Thessalonians 3-6 <pb/>But <f>ⓚ</f>now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of <f>ⓛ</f>your faith and love and reported <f>ⓜ</f>that you always remember us kindly and <f>ⓝ</f>long to see us, as we long to see you —
1 Thessalonians 3-7 for this reason, brothers, <f>[2]</f> in all our distress and affliction <f>ⓞ</f>we have been comforted about you through your faith.
1 Thessalonians 3-8 For now we live, if you <f>ⓟ</f>are standing fast in the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 3-9 For <f>ⓠ</f>what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God,
1 Thessalonians 3-10 as we pray most earnestly <f>ⓡ</f>night and day <f>ⓢ</f>that we may see you face to face and <f>ⓣ</f>supply what is lacking in your faith?
1 Thessalonians 3-11 <pb/>Now may <f>ⓤ</f>our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, <f>ⓥ</f>direct our way to you,
1 Thessalonians 3-12 and may the Lord <f>ⓦ</f>make you increase and abound in love <f>ⓧ</f>for one another and for all, as we do for you,
1 Thessalonians 3-13 so that he may <f>ⓨ</f>establish your hearts blameless in holiness before <f>ⓩ</f>our God and Father, at <f>ⓐ</f>the coming of our Lord Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>with all his saints.
