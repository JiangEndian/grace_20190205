Romans 13-1 <pb/>Let every person <f>ⓐ</f>be subject to the governing authorities. For <f>ⓑ</f>there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.
Romans 13-2 Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.
Romans 13-3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you <f>ⓒ</f>will receive his approval,
Romans 13-4 for <f>ⓓ</f>he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, <f>ⓔ</f>an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.
Romans 13-5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also <f>ⓕ</f>for the sake of conscience.
Romans 13-6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.
Romans 13-7 <f>ⓖ</f> Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.
Romans 13-8 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for <f>ⓘ</f>the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.

Romans 13-10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore <f>ⓛ</f>love is the fulfilling of the law.
Romans 13-11 <pb/>Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you <f>ⓜ</f>to wake from sleep. <f>ⓝ</f>For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.
Romans 13-12 <f>ⓞ</f> The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us <f>ⓟ</f>cast off <f>ⓠ</f>the works of darkness and <f>ⓡ</f>put on the armor of light.
Romans 13-13 <f>ⓢ</f> Let us walk properly as in the daytime, <f>ⓣ</f>not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, <f>ⓤ</f>not in quarreling and jealousy.
Romans 13-14 But <f>ⓥ</f>put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, <f>ⓦ</f>to gratify its desires.
