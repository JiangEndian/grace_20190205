Numbers 9-1 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, <f>ⓐ</f>in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers 9-2 “Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.
Numbers 9-3 <f>ⓑ</f> On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it.”
Numbers 9-4 So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
Numbers 9-5 And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.
Numbers 9-6 And there were certain men who were <f>ⓒ</f>unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and <f>ⓓ</f>they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
Numbers 9-7 And those men said to him, “We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the LORD's <f>ⓔ</f>offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?”
Numbers 9-8 And Moses said to them, “Wait, that <f>ⓕ</f>I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.”
Numbers 9-9 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 9-10 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the LORD.
Numbers 9-11 <f>ⓖ</f> In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. <f>ⓗ</f>They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Numbers 9-12 <f>ⓘ</f> They shall leave none of it until the morning, <f>ⓙ</f>nor break any of its bones; <f>ⓚ</f>according to all the statute for the Passover they shall keep it.
Numbers 9-13 But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, <f>ⓛ</f>that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the LORD's <f>ⓜ</f>offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.
Numbers 9-14 And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the LORD, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. <f>ⓝ</f>You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native.”
Numbers 9-15 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And <f>ⓟ</f>at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.
Numbers 9-16 So it was always: the cloud covered it by day <f>[1]</f> and the appearance of fire by night.
Numbers 9-17 And whenever the cloud <f>ⓠ</f>lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped.
Numbers 9-18 At the command of the LORD the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the LORD they camped. <f>ⓡ</f>As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
Numbers 9-19 Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel <f>ⓢ</f>kept the charge of the LORD and did not set out.
Numbers 9-20 Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp; then according to the command of the LORD they set out.
Numbers 9-21 And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out.
Numbers 9-22 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel <f>ⓣ</f>remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out.
Numbers 9-23 At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they set out. <f>ⓤ</f>They kept the charge of the LORD, at the command of the LORD by Moses.
