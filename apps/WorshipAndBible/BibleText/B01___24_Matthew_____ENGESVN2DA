Matthew 24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
Matthew 24-2 But he answered them, <J>“You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓑ</f>there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”</J>
Matthew 24-3 <pb/>As he sat on <f>ⓒ</f>the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him <f>ⓓ</f>privately, saying, “Tell us, <f>ⓔ</f>when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your <f>ⓕ</f>coming and of <f>ⓖ</f>the end of the age?”
Matthew 24-4 And Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“See that no one leads you astray.</J>
Matthew 24-5 <J>For <f>ⓘ</f>many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am <f>ⓙ</f>the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.</J>
Matthew 24-6 <J>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you <f>ⓚ</f>are not alarmed, for this <f>ⓛ</f>must take place, but the end is not yet.</J>
Matthew 24-7 <J>For <f>ⓜ</f>nation will rise against nation, and <f>ⓝ</f>kingdom against kingdom, and there will be <f>ⓞ</f>famines and earthquakes in various places.</J>
Matthew 24-8 <J>All these are but the beginning of <f>ⓟ</f>the birth pains.</J>
Matthew 24-9 <pb/><J>“Then <f>ⓠ</f>they will deliver you up <f>ⓡ</f>to tribulation and <f>ⓢ</f>put you to death, and <f>ⓣ</f>you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.</J>
Matthew 24-10 <J>And then many will fall away <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓤ</f>betray one another and hate one another.</J>
Matthew 24-11 <J>And many <f>ⓥ</f>false prophets will arise <f>ⓦ</f>and lead many astray.</J>
Matthew 24-12 <J>And because lawlessness will be increased, <f>ⓧ</f>the love of many will grow cold.</J>
Matthew 24-13 <J><f>ⓨ</f> But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</J>
Matthew 24-14 <J>And this gospel of the kingdom <f>ⓩ</f>will be proclaimed throughout the whole world <f>ⓐ</f>as a testimony <f>ⓑ</f>to all nations, and <f>ⓒ</f>then the end will come.</J>
Matthew 24-15 <pb/><J>“So when you see the abomination of desolation <f>ⓓ</f>spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in <f>ⓔ</f>the holy place (<f>ⓕ</f>let the reader understand),</J>
Matthew 24-16 <J>then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</J>
Matthew 24-17 <J><f>ⓖ</f> Let the one who is on <f>ⓗ</f>the housetop not go down to take what is in his house,</J>
Matthew 24-18 <J>and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.</J>
Matthew 24-19 <J>And <f>ⓘ</f>alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days!</J>
Matthew 24-20 <J>Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.</J>
Matthew 24-21 <J>For then there will be <f>ⓙ</f>great tribulation, <f>ⓚ</f>such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.</J>
Matthew 24-22 <J>And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for <f>ⓛ</f>the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.</J>
Matthew 24-23 <J><f>ⓜ</f> Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.</J>
Matthew 24-24 <J>For <f>ⓝ</f>false christs and <f>ⓞ</f>false prophets will arise and <f>ⓟ</f>perform great signs and wonders, <f>ⓠ</f>so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</J>
Matthew 24-25 <J>See, <f>ⓡ</f>I have told you beforehand.</J>
Matthew 24-26 <J>So, if they say to you, ‘Look, <f>ⓢ</f>he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.</J>
Matthew 24-27 <J><f>ⓣ</f> For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be <f>ⓤ</f>the coming of the Son of Man.</J>
Matthew 24-28 <J><f>ⓥ</f> Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.</J>
Matthew 24-29 <pb/><J>“Immediately after <f>ⓦ</f>the tribulation of those days <f>ⓧ</f>the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and <f>ⓨ</f>the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</J>
Matthew 24-30 <J>Then <f>ⓩ</f>will appear in heaven <f>ⓐ</f>the sign of the Son of Man, and then <f>ⓑ</f>all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and <f>ⓒ</f>they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven <f>ⓓ</f>with power and great glory.</J>
Matthew 24-31 <J>And <f>ⓔ</f>he will send out his angels with a loud <f>ⓕ</f>trumpet call, and they will <f>ⓖ</f>gather <f>ⓗ</f>his elect from <f>ⓘ</f>the four winds, <f>ⓙ</f>from one end of heaven to the other.</J>
Matthew 24-32 <pb/><J>“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.</J>
Matthew 24-33 <J>So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, <f>ⓚ</f>at the very gates.</J>
Matthew 24-34 <J><f>ⓛ</f> Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.</J>
Matthew 24-35 <J><f>ⓜ</f> Heaven and earth will pass away, but <f>ⓝ</f>my words will not pass away.</J>
Matthew 24-36 <pb/><J>“But concerning that day and hour <f>ⓞ</f>no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, <f>ⓟ</f>nor the Son, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓠ</f>but the Father only.</J>
Matthew 24-37 <J><f>ⓡ</f> For as were the days of Noah, <f>ⓢ</f>so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</J>
Matthew 24-38 <J><f>ⓣ</f> For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, <f>ⓤ</f>marrying and giving in marriage, until <f>ⓥ</f>the day when Noah entered the ark,</J>
Matthew 24-39 <J>and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, <f>ⓦ</f>so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</J>
Matthew 24-40 <J>Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.</J>
Matthew 24-41 <J><f>ⓧ</f> Two women will be grinding <f>ⓨ</f>at the mill; one will be taken and one left.</J>
Matthew 24-42 <J>Therefore, <f>ⓩ</f>stay awake, for you do not know on what day <f>ⓐ</f>your Lord is coming.</J>
Matthew 24-43 <J><f>ⓑ</f> But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night <f>ⓒ</f>the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.</J>
Matthew 24-44 <J>Therefore you also must be <f>ⓓ</f>ready, for <f>ⓔ</f>the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.</J>
Matthew 24-45 <pb/><J>“Who then is <f>ⓕ</f>the faithful and <f>ⓖ</f>wise servant, <f>[3]</f> whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?</J>
Matthew 24-46 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.</J>
Matthew 24-47 <J>Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓘ</f>he will set him over all his possessions.</J>
Matthew 24-48 <J>But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master <f>ⓙ</f>is delayed,’</J>
Matthew 24-49 <J>and begins to beat his fellow servants <f>[4]</f> and eats and drinks with <f>ⓚ</f>drunkards,</J>
Matthew 24-50 <J>the master of that servant will come <f>ⓛ</f>on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know</J>
Matthew 24-51 <J>and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place <f>ⓜ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</J>
