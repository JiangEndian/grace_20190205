Ecclesiastes 6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:
Ecclesiastes 6-2 a man <f>ⓑ</f>to whom <f>ⓒ</f>God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he <f>ⓓ</f>lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God <f>ⓔ</f>does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; <f>[1]</f> it is a grievous evil.
Ecclesiastes 6-3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that <f>ⓕ</f>the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life's <f>ⓖ</f>good things, and he also has no <f>ⓗ</f>burial, I say that <f>ⓘ</f>a stillborn child is better off than he.
Ecclesiastes 6-4 For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.
Ecclesiastes 6-5 Moreover, it has not <f>ⓙ</f>seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds <f>ⓚ</f>rest rather than he.
Ecclesiastes 6-6 Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy <f>[2]</f> no good — do not all go to the one place?
Ecclesiastes 6-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied. <f>[3]</f>
Ecclesiastes 6-8 For what advantage has the wise man <f>ⓜ</f>over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?
Ecclesiastes 6-9 Better <f>ⓝ</f>is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is <f>ⓞ</f>vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes 6-10 <pb/>Whatever has come to be has <f>ⓟ</f>already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to <f>ⓠ</f>dispute with one stronger than he.
Ecclesiastes 6-11 The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?
Ecclesiastes 6-12 For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his <f>ⓡ</f>vain <f>[4]</f> life, which he passes like <f>ⓢ</f>a shadow? For who can tell man what will be <f>ⓣ</f>after him under the sun?
