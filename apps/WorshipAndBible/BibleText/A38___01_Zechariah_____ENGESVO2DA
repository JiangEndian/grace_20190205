Zechariah 1-1 <pb/>In the eighth month, <f>ⓐ</f>in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet <f>ⓑ</f>Zechariah, the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Berechiah, son of <f>ⓓ</f>Iddo, saying,
Zechariah 1-2 <f>ⓔ</f> “The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
Zechariah 1-3 Therefore say to them, Thus declares the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓕ</f>Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and <f>ⓖ</f>I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah 1-4 <f>ⓗ</f> Do not be like your fathers, <f>ⓘ</f>to whom the former prophets cried out, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓙ</f>Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.’ But <f>ⓚ</f>they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the LORD.
Zechariah 1-5 Your fathers, where are they? And <f>ⓛ</f>the prophets, do they live forever?
Zechariah 1-6 <f>ⓜ</f> But my words and my statutes, which I commanded <f>ⓝ</f>my servants the prophets, did they not <f>ⓞ</f>overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, <f>ⓟ</f>‘As the LORD of hosts purposed to deal with us for <f>ⓠ</f>our ways and <f>ⓡ</f>deeds, so has he dealt with us.’”
Zechariah 1-7 <pb/>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet <f>ⓢ</f>Zechariah, the son of <f>ⓣ</f>Berechiah, son of <f>ⓤ</f>Iddo, saying,
Zechariah 1-8 “I saw in the night, and behold, <f>ⓥ</f>a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were <f>ⓦ</f>red, sorrel, and white horses.
Zechariah 1-9 Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ <f>ⓧ</f>The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’
Zechariah 1-10 So <f>ⓨ</f>the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, <f>ⓩ</f>‘These are they whom the LORD has sent to <f>ⓐ</f>patrol the earth.’
Zechariah 1-11 And they answered <f>ⓑ</f>the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, <f>ⓒ</f>‘We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth <f>ⓓ</f>remains at rest.’
Zechariah 1-12 Then <f>ⓔ</f>the angel of the LORD said, <f>ⓕ</f>‘O LORD of hosts, <f>ⓖ</f>how long will you <f>ⓗ</f>have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these <f>ⓘ</f>seventy years?’
Zechariah 1-13 And the LORD answered <f>ⓙ</f>gracious and comforting words to <f>ⓚ</f>the angel who talked with me.
Zechariah 1-14 So <f>ⓛ</f>the angel who talked with me said to me, ‘Cry out, Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓜ</f>I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.
Zechariah 1-15 <f>ⓝ</f> And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are <f>ⓞ</f>at ease; <f>ⓟ</f>for while I was angry but a little, <f>ⓠ</f>they furthered the disaster.
Zechariah 1-16 Therefore, thus says the LORD, <f>ⓡ</f>I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; <f>ⓢ</f>my house shall be built in it, declares the LORD of hosts, and <f>ⓣ</f>the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
Zechariah 1-17 Cry out again, Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓤ</f>My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, <f>ⓥ</f>and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again <f>ⓦ</f>choose Jerusalem.’”
Zechariah 1-18 <pb/><f>[1]</f> And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, <f>ⓧ</f>four horns!
Zechariah 1-19 And I said to <f>ⓨ</f>the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” And he said to me, <f>ⓩ</f>“These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
Zechariah 1-20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
Zechariah 1-21 And I said, “What are these coming to do?” He said, <f>ⓐ</f>“These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one raised his head. And these have come <f>ⓑ</f>to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations <f>ⓒ</f>who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”
