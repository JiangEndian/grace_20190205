James 2-1 <pb/>My brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, <f>ⓑ</f>the Lord of glory.
James 2-2 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,
James 2-3 and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” <f>ⓒ</f>while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”
James 2-4 have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become <f>ⓓ</f>judges with evil thoughts?
James 2-5 Listen, my beloved brothers, <f>ⓔ</f>has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be <f>ⓕ</f>rich in faith and heirs of <f>ⓖ</f>the kingdom, <f>ⓗ</f>which he has promised to those who love him?
James 2-6 But you <f>ⓘ</f>have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who <f>ⓙ</f>drag you <f>ⓚ</f>into court?
James 2-7 Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable <f>ⓛ</f>name by which you were called?
James 2-8 <pb/>If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, <f>ⓜ</f>“You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.
James 2-9 But if you <f>ⓝ</f>show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
James 2-10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point <f>ⓞ</f>has become guilty of all of it.
James 2-11 For he who said, <f>ⓟ</f>“Do not commit adultery,” also said, <f>ⓠ</f>“Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
James 2-12 So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under <f>ⓡ</f>the law of liberty.
James 2-13 For <f>ⓢ</f>judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
James 2-14 <pb/>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith <f>ⓣ</f>but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
James 2-15 <f>ⓤ</f> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,
James 2-16 <f>ⓥ</f> and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good <f>[2]</f> is that?
James 2-17 So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
James 2-18 <pb/>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith <f>ⓦ</f>apart from your works, and I will show you my faith <f>ⓧ</f>by my works.
James 2-19 <f>ⓨ</f> You believe that God is one; you do well. Even <f>ⓩ</f>the demons believe — and shudder!
James 2-20 Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?
James 2-21 <f>ⓐ</f> Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?
James 2-22 You see that <f>ⓑ</f>faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed <f>ⓒ</f>by his works;
James 2-23 and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, <f>ⓓ</f>“Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness” — and he was called a <f>ⓔ</f>friend of God.
James 2-24 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
James 2-25 And in the same way was not also <f>ⓕ</f>Rahab the prostitute justified by works <f>ⓖ</f>when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
James 2-26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.
