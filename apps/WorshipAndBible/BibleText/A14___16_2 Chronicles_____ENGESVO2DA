2 Chronicles 16-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the <f>ⓑ</f>thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, <f>ⓒ</f>that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
2 Chronicles 16-2 Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the LORD and the king's house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
2 Chronicles 16-3 “There is a covenant <f>[1]</f> between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.”
2 Chronicles 16-4 And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the <f>ⓓ</f>store cities of Naphtali.
2 Chronicles 16-5 And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease.
2 Chronicles 16-6 Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.
2 Chronicles 16-7 <pb/>At that time <f>ⓔ</f>Hanani <f>ⓕ</f>the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you.
2 Chronicles 16-8 Were not <f>ⓗ</f>the Ethiopians and <f>ⓘ</f>the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet <f>ⓙ</f>because you relied on the LORD, he gave them into your hand.
2 Chronicles 16-9 <f>ⓚ</f> For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those <f>ⓛ</f>whose heart is blameless <f>[2]</f> toward him. <f>ⓜ</f>You have done foolishly in this, for from now on <f>ⓝ</f>you will have wars.”
2 Chronicles 16-10 Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him <f>ⓞ</f>in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.

2 Chronicles 16-13 And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.
2 Chronicles 16-14 They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier <f>ⓠ</f>that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer's art, <f>ⓡ</f>and they made a very great fire in his honor.
