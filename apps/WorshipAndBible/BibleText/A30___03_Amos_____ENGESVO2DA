Amos 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:
Amos 3-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> “You only have I known </t><t>of all the families of the earth; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>therefore I will punish you </t><t>for all your iniquities. </t>
Amos 3-3 <pb/><t>“Do two walk together, </t><t>unless they have agreed to meet?</t>
Amos 3-4 <t>Does a lion roar in the forest, </t><t>when he has no prey? </t><t>Does a young lion cry out from his den, </t><t>if he has taken nothing?</t>
Amos 3-5 <t>Does a bird fall in a snare on the earth, </t><t>when there is no trap for it? </t><t>Does a snare spring up from the ground, </t><t>when it has taken nothing?</t>
Amos 3-6 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Is a trumpet blown in a city, </t><t>and the people are not afraid? </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>Does disaster come to a city, </t><t>unless the LORD has done it? </t>
Amos 3-7 <pb/><t>“For the Lord GOD does nothing </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>without revealing his secret </t><t>to his servants the prophets.</t>
Amos 3-8 <t>The lion has roared; </t><t>who will not fear? </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>The Lord GOD has spoken; </t><t>who can but prophesy?” </t>
Amos 3-9 <pb/><t>Proclaim to the strongholds in <f>ⓗ</f>Ashdod </t><t>and to the strongholds in the land of Egypt, </t><t>and say, “Assemble yourselves on <f>ⓘ</f>the mountains of Samaria, </t><t>and see the great tumults within her, </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>the oppressed in her midst.”</t>
Amos 3-10 <t>“They do not know how to do right,” declares the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>“those who store up violence and robbery in their strongholds.” </t>
Amos 3-11 <pb/>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f>“An adversary shall surround the land </t><t>and bring down <f>[1]</f> your defenses from you, </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>your strongholds shall be plundered.” </t>
Amos 3-12 <pb/>Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓝ</f>“As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, <f>ⓞ</f>so shall the people of Israel <f>ⓟ</f>who dwell in Samaria be rescued, with the corner of a couch and part <f>[2]</f> of a bed.
Amos 3-13 <pb/><t>“Hear, <f>ⓠ</f>and testify against the house of Jacob,” </t><t>declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓡ</f>the God of hosts,</t>
Amos 3-14 <t>“that on the day I punish Israel for his transgressions, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>I will punish the altars of Bethel, </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>the horns of the altar shall be cut off </t><t>and fall to the ground.</t>
Amos 3-15 <t><f>ⓤ</f> I will strike <f>ⓥ</f>the winter house along with <f>ⓦ</f>the summer house, </t><t>and <f>ⓧ</f>the houses of ivory shall perish, </t><t>and the great houses <f>[3]</f> shall come to an end,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
