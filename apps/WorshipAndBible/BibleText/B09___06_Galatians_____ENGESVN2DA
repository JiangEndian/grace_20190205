Galatians 6-1 <pb/>Brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>if anyone is caught in any transgression, <f>ⓑ</f>you who are spiritual should restore him in <f>ⓒ</f>a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
Galatians 6-2 <f>ⓓ</f> Bear one another's burdens, and <f>ⓔ</f>so fulfill <f>ⓕ</f>the law of Christ.
Galatians 6-3 For <f>ⓖ</f>if anyone thinks he is something, <f>ⓗ</f>when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
Galatians 6-4 But let each one <f>ⓘ</f>test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.
Galatians 6-5 For <f>ⓙ</f>each will have to bear his own load.
Galatians 6-6 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.
Galatians 6-7 <f>ⓛ</f> Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for <f>ⓜ</f>whatever one sows, that will he also reap.
Galatians 6-8 For <f>ⓝ</f>the one who sows to his own flesh <f>ⓞ</f>will from the flesh reap corruption, but <f>ⓟ</f>the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
Galatians 6-9 And <f>ⓠ</f>let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, <f>ⓡ</f>if we do not give up.
Galatians 6-10 So then, <f>ⓢ</f>as we have opportunity, let us <f>ⓣ</f>do good to everyone, and especially to those who are <f>ⓤ</f>of the household of faith.
Galatians 6-11 <pb/>See with what large letters I am writing to you <f>ⓥ</f>with my own hand.
Galatians 6-12 <f>ⓦ</f> It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh <f>ⓧ</f>who would force you to be circumcised, and only <f>ⓨ</f>in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians 6-13 For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
Galatians 6-14 But far be it from me to boast <f>ⓩ</f>except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which <f>[2]</f> the world <f>ⓐ</f>has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
Galatians 6-15 For <f>ⓑ</f>neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but <f>ⓒ</f>a new creation.
Galatians 6-16 And as for all who walk by this rule, <f>ⓓ</f>peace and mercy be upon them, and upon <f>ⓔ</f>the Israel of God.
Galatians 6-17 <pb/>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
Galatians 6-18 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be <f>ⓖ</f>with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
