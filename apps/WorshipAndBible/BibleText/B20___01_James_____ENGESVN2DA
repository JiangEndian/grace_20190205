James 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> James, a servant <f>[1]</f> of God and <f>ⓑ</f>of the Lord Jesus Christ, <pb/>To <f>ⓒ</f>the twelve tribes in <f>ⓓ</f>the Dispersion: <pb/>Greetings.
James 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Count it all joy, my brothers, <f>[2]</f> when you meet trials <f>ⓕ</f>of various kinds,
James 1-3 for you know that <f>ⓖ</f>the testing of your faith <f>ⓗ</f>produces steadfastness.
James 1-4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be <f>ⓘ</f>perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
James 1-5 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> If any of you lacks wisdom, <f>ⓚ</f>let him ask God, <f>ⓛ</f>who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
James 1-6 But <f>ⓜ</f>let him ask in faith, <f>ⓝ</f>with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like <f>ⓞ</f>a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
James 1-7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
James 1-8 <f>ⓟ</f> he is a double-minded man, <f>ⓠ</f>unstable in all his ways.
James 1-9 <pb/>Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
James 1-10 and <f>ⓡ</f>the rich in his humiliation, because <f>ⓢ</f>like a flower of the grass <f>[3]</f> he will pass away.
James 1-11 For the sun rises with its scorching heat and <f>ⓣ</f>withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.
James 1-12 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive <f>ⓥ</f>the crown of life, <f>ⓦ</f>which God has promised to those who love him.
James 1-13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.
James 1-14 But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.
James 1-15 Then desire <f>ⓧ</f>when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and <f>ⓨ</f>sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.
James 1-16 <pb/>Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
James 1-17 <f>ⓩ</f> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from <f>ⓐ</f>the Father of lights, <f>ⓑ</f>with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. <f>[4]</f>
James 1-18 <f>ⓒ</f> Of his own will he <f>ⓓ</f>brought us forth by the word of truth, <f>ⓔ</f>that we should be a kind of <f>ⓕ</f>firstfruits of his creatures.
James 1-19 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person <f>ⓗ</f>be quick to hear, <f>ⓘ</f>slow to speak, <f>ⓙ</f>slow to anger;
James 1-20 for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
James 1-21 Therefore <f>ⓚ</f>put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with <f>ⓛ</f>meekness the implanted word, <f>ⓜ</f>which is able to save your souls.
James 1-22 <pb/>But be <f>ⓝ</f>doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
James 1-23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.
James 1-24 For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.
James 1-25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, <f>ⓞ</f>the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, <f>ⓟ</f>he will be blessed in his doing.
James 1-26 <pb/>If anyone thinks he is religious <f>ⓠ</f>and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's <f>ⓡ</f>religion is worthless.
James 1-27 Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: <f>ⓢ</f>to visit <f>ⓣ</f>orphans and widows in their affliction, and <f>ⓤ</f>to keep oneself <f>ⓥ</f>unstained from the world.
