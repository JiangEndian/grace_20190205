Luke 22-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called <f>ⓑ</f>the Passover.
Luke 22-2 And the chief priests and the scribes <f>ⓒ</f>were seeking how to put him to death, for they feared the people.
Luke 22-3 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Then <f>ⓔ</f>Satan entered into <f>ⓕ</f>Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.
Luke 22-4 He went away and conferred with the chief priests and <f>ⓖ</f>officers how he might betray him to them.
Luke 22-5 And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.
Luke 22-6 So he consented and sought an opportunity to <f>ⓗ</f>betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.
Luke 22-7 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Then came <f>ⓙ</f>the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
Luke 22-8 So Jesus <f>[1]</f> sent Peter and John, saying, <J>“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.”</J>
Luke 22-9 They said to him, “Where will you have us prepare it?”
Luke 22-10 He said to them, <J>“Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters</J>
Luke 22-11 <J>and tell the master of the house, <f>ⓚ</f>‘The Teacher says to you, Where is <f>ⓛ</f>the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</J>
Luke 22-12 <J>And he will show you <f>ⓜ</f>a large upper room furnished; prepare it there.”</J>
Luke 22-13 And they went and found it <f>ⓝ</f>just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
Luke 22-14 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him.
Luke 22-15 And he said to them, <J>“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</J>
Luke 22-16 <J>For I tell you I will not eat it <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</J>
Luke 22-17 And he took a cup, and <f>ⓠ</f>when he had given thanks he said, <J>“Take this, and divide it among yourselves.</J>
Luke 22-18 <J><f>ⓡ</f> For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine <f>ⓢ</f>until the kingdom of God comes.”</J>
Luke 22-19 <f>ⓣ</f> And he took bread, and <f>ⓤ</f>when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</J>
Luke 22-20 And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, <J> <f>ⓦ</f>“This cup that is poured out for you is <f>ⓧ</f>the new <f>ⓨ</f>covenant in my blood. <f>[3]</f></J>
Luke 22-21 <J><f>ⓩ</f> But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is <f>ⓐ</f>with me on the table.</J>
Luke 22-22 <J>For the Son of Man goes <f>ⓑ</f>as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!”</J>
Luke 22-23 And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this.
Luke 22-24 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> A dispute also arose among them, as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.
Luke 22-25 <f>ⓓ</f> And he said to them, <J>“The kings of the Gentiles <f>ⓔ</f>exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors.</J>
Luke 22-26 <J><f>ⓕ</f> But not so with you. Rather, let <f>ⓖ</f>the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.</J>
Luke 22-27 <J>For who is the greater, <f>ⓗ</f>one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But <f>ⓘ</f>I am among you as the one who serves.</J>
Luke 22-28 <pb/><J>“You are those who have stayed with me <f>ⓙ</f>in my trials,</J>
Luke 22-29 <J>and <f>ⓚ</f>I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom,</J>
Luke 22-30 <J><f>ⓛ</f> that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and <f>ⓜ</f>sit on thrones judging <f>ⓝ</f>the twelve tribes of Israel.</J>
Luke 22-31 <pb/><J>“Simon, Simon, behold, <f>ⓞ</f>Satan demanded to have you, <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>that he might sift you like wheat,</J>
Luke 22-32 <J>but <f>ⓠ</f>I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, <f>ⓡ</f>strengthen your brothers.”</J>
Luke 22-33 Peter <f>[5]</f> said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both <f>ⓢ</f>to prison and <f>ⓣ</f>to death.”
Luke 22-34 <f>ⓤ</f> Jesus <f>[6]</f> said, <J>“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.”</J>
Luke 22-35 <pb/>And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?”</J> They said, “Nothing.”
Luke 22-36 He said to them, <J>“But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.</J>
Luke 22-37 <J>For I tell you that <f>ⓦ</f>this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: <f>ⓧ</f>‘And he was numbered with the transgressors.’ For <f>ⓨ</f>what is written about me has its fulfillment.”</J>
Luke 22-38 And they said, “Look, Lord, here are two <f>ⓩ</f>swords.” And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“It is enough.”</J>
Luke 22-39 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> And he came out and went, <f>ⓒ</f>as was his custom, to <f>ⓓ</f>the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.
Luke 22-40 <f>ⓔ</f> And when he came to <f>ⓕ</f>the place, he said to them, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Pray that you may not <f>ⓗ</f>enter into temptation.”</J>
Luke 22-41 And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and <f>ⓘ</f>knelt down and prayed,
Luke 22-42 saying, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“Father, if you are willing, remove <f>ⓚ</f>this cup from me. <f>ⓛ</f>Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</J>
Luke 22-43 And there appeared to him <f>ⓜ</f>an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
Luke 22-44 And <f>ⓝ</f>being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. <f>[7]</f>
Luke 22-45 And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow,
Luke 22-46 and he said to them, <J>“Why are you sleeping? Rise and <f>ⓞ</f>pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</J>
Luke 22-47 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called <f>ⓠ</f>Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him,
Luke 22-48 but Jesus said to him, <J>“Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</J>
Luke 22-49 And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, “Lord, shall we strike <f>ⓡ</f>with the sword?”
Luke 22-50 And one of them struck the servant <f>[8]</f> of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
Luke 22-51 But Jesus said, <J>“No more of this!”</J> And he touched his ear and healed him.
Luke 22-52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests and <f>ⓢ</f>officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, <J>“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</J>
Luke 22-53 <J>When <f>ⓣ</f>I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is <f>ⓤ</f>your hour, and <f>ⓥ</f>the power of darkness.”</J>
Luke 22-54 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house, <f>ⓧ</f>and Peter was following at a distance.
Luke 22-55 <f>ⓨ</f> And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of <f>ⓩ</f>the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
Luke 22-56 Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, “This man also was with him.”
Luke 22-57 But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.”
Luke 22-58 And a little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”
Luke 22-59 And after an interval of about an hour still another <f>ⓐ</f>insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.”
Luke 22-60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
Luke 22-61 And the Lord turned and <f>ⓑ</f>looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“Before the rooster crows today, you will <f>ⓓ</f>deny me three times.”</J>
Luke 22-62 And he went out and wept bitterly.
Luke 22-63 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him.
Luke 22-64 <f>ⓕ</f> They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Prophesy! <f>ⓗ</f>Who is it that struck you?”
Luke 22-65 And they said many other things against him, <f>ⓘ</f>blaspheming him.
Luke 22-66 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> When day came, <f>ⓚ</f>the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. And they led him away to their <f>ⓛ</f>council, and they <f>ⓜ</f>said,
Luke 22-67 <f>ⓝ</f> “If you are <f>ⓞ</f>the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, <J>“If I tell you, you will not believe,</J>
Luke 22-68 <J>and if I ask you, you will not answer.</J>
Luke 22-69 <J>But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated <f>ⓟ</f>at the right hand of the power of God.”</J>
Luke 22-70 So they all said, “Are you <f>ⓠ</f>the Son of God, then?” And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓡ</f>“You say that I am.”</J>
Luke 22-71 Then they said, “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.”
