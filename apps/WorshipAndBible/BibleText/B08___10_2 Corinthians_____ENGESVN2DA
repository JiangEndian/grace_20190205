2 Corinthians 10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the <f>ⓑ</f>meekness and gentleness of Christ — I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away! —
2 Corinthians 10-2 I beg of you <f>ⓒ</f>that when I am present I may not have to show <f>ⓓ</f>boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh.
2 Corinthians 10-3 For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh.
2 Corinthians 10-4 For the <f>ⓔ</f>weapons of <f>ⓕ</f>our warfare are not of the flesh but have <f>ⓖ</f>divine power <f>ⓗ</f>to destroy strongholds.
2 Corinthians 10-5 We destroy arguments and <f>ⓘ</f>every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to <f>ⓙ</f>obey Christ,
2 Corinthians 10-6 <f>ⓚ</f> being ready to punish every disobedience, <f>ⓛ</f>when your obedience is complete.
2 Corinthians 10-7 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Look at what is before your eyes. <f>ⓝ</f>If anyone is confident that he is Christ's, let him remind himself that just as <f>ⓞ</f>he is Christ's, <f>ⓟ</f>so also are we.
2 Corinthians 10-8 For even if I boast a little too much of <f>ⓠ</f>our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed.
2 Corinthians 10-9 I do not want to appear to be frightening you with my letters.
2 Corinthians 10-10 For they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but <f>ⓡ</f>his bodily presence is weak, and <f>ⓢ</f>his speech of no account.”
2 Corinthians 10-11 Let such a person understand that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present.
2 Corinthians 10-12 Not that we dare to classify or <f>ⓣ</f>compare ourselves with some of those who <f>ⓤ</f>are commending themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they are <f>ⓥ</f>without understanding.
2 Corinthians 10-13 <pb/>But we will not boast <f>ⓦ</f>beyond limits, but will <f>ⓧ</f>boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us, <f>ⓨ</f>to reach even to you.
2 Corinthians 10-14 For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you. <f>ⓩ</f>For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ.
2 Corinthians 10-15 We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others. But our hope is that <f>ⓐ</f>as your faith increases, our area of influence among you may be <f>ⓑ</f>greatly enlarged,
2 Corinthians 10-16 so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in another's area of influence.
2 Corinthians 10-17 “Let <f>ⓒ</f>the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
2 Corinthians 10-18 For it is <f>ⓓ</f>not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one <f>ⓔ</f>whom the Lord commends.
