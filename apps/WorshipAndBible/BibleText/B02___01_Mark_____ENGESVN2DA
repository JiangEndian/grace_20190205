Mark 1-1 <pb/>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, <f>ⓐ</f>the Son of God. <f>[1]</f>
Mark 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, <f>[2]</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Behold, I send my messenger before your face, </t><t>who will prepare your way,</t>
Mark 1-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> the voice of one crying in the wilderness: </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>‘Prepare <f>[3]</f> the way of the Lord, </t><t>make his paths straight,’” </t>
Mark 1-4 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> John appeared, baptizing in <f>ⓖ</f>the wilderness and proclaiming <f>ⓗ</f>a baptism of <f>ⓘ</f>repentance <f>ⓙ</f>for the forgiveness of sins.
Mark 1-5 And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, <f>ⓚ</f>confessing their sins.
Mark 1-6 Now John was <f>ⓛ</f>clothed with camel's hair and <f>ⓜ</f>wore a leather belt around his waist and ate <f>ⓝ</f>locusts and <f>ⓞ</f>wild honey.
Mark 1-7 And he preached, saying, <f>ⓟ</f>“After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
Mark 1-8 <f>ⓠ</f> I have baptized you with water, but <f>ⓡ</f>he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
Mark 1-9 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> In those days Jesus <f>ⓣ</f>came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Mark 1-10 And when he came up out of the water, immediately he <f>ⓤ</f>saw <f>ⓥ</f>the heavens being torn open <f>ⓦ</f>and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
Mark 1-11 And <f>ⓧ</f>a voice came from heaven, <f>ⓨ</f>“You are my beloved Son; <f>[4]</f> with you I am well pleased.”
Mark 1-12 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
Mark 1-13 <f>ⓐ</f> And he was in the wilderness forty days, being <f>ⓑ</f>tempted by <f>ⓒ</f>Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and <f>ⓓ</f>the angels were ministering to him.
Mark 1-14 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Now after John was arrested, Jesus <f>ⓕ</f>came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,
Mark 1-15 and saying, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“The time is fulfilled, and <f>ⓗ</f>the kingdom of God is at hand; <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>repent and believe in the gospel.”</J>
Mark 1-16 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Mark 1-17 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Follow me, and I will make you become <f>ⓚ</f>fishers of men.” <f>[6]</f></J>
Mark 1-18 And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Mark 1-19 And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets.
Mark 1-20 And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.
Mark 1-21 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And they went into Capernaum, and immediately <f>ⓜ</f>on the Sabbath <f>ⓝ</f>he entered the synagogue and was teaching.
Mark 1-22 And <f>ⓞ</f>they were astonished at his teaching, <f>ⓟ</f>for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
Mark 1-23 And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,
Mark 1-24 <f>ⓠ</f> “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? <f>ⓡ</f>I know who you are — <f>ⓢ</f>the Holy One of God.”
Mark 1-25 But Jesus <f>ⓣ</f>rebuked him, saying, <J>“Be silent, and come out of him!”</J>
Mark 1-26 And the unclean spirit, <f>ⓤ</f>convulsing him and <f>ⓥ</f>crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.
Mark 1-27 And they were all <f>ⓦ</f>amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? <f>ⓧ</f>A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.”
Mark 1-28 And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.
Mark 1-29 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> And immediately he <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Mark 1-30 Now <f>ⓐ</f>Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
Mark 1-31 And he came and <f>ⓑ</f>took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
Mark 1-32 <pb/>That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or <f>ⓒ</f>oppressed by demons.
Mark 1-33 And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
Mark 1-34 <f>ⓓ</f> And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And <f>ⓔ</f>he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.
Mark 1-35 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and <f>ⓖ</f>there he prayed.
Mark 1-36 And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,
Mark 1-37 and they found him and said to him, <f>ⓗ</f>“Everyone is looking for you.”
Mark 1-38 And he said to them, <J>“Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for <f>ⓘ</f>that is why I came out.”</J>
Mark 1-39 <f>ⓙ</f> And <f>ⓚ</f>he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.
Mark 1-40 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And a leper <f>[8]</f> came to him, imploring him, and <f>ⓜ</f>kneeling said to him, <f>ⓝ</f>“If you will, you can make me clean.”
Mark 1-41 Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, <J>“I will; be clean.”</J>
Mark 1-42 And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.
Mark 1-43 And <f>ⓞ</f>Jesus <f>[9]</f> sternly charged him and sent him away at once,
Mark 1-44 and said to him, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, <f>ⓠ</f>show yourself to the priest and <f>ⓡ</f>offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, <f>ⓢ</f>for a proof to them.”</J>
Mark 1-45 <f>ⓣ</f> But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter <f>ⓤ</f>a town, but was out in <f>ⓥ</f>desolate places, and <f>ⓦ</f>people were coming to him from every quarter.
