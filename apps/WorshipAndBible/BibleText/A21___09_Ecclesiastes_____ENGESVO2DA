Ecclesiastes 9-1 <pb/>But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, <f>ⓐ</f>how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are <f>ⓑ</f>in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.
Ecclesiastes 9-2 <f>ⓒ</f> It is the same for all, since <f>ⓓ</f>the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, <f>[1]</f> to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who <f>ⓔ</f>swears is as he who shuns an oath.
Ecclesiastes 9-3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that <f>ⓕ</f>the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and <f>ⓖ</f>madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
Ecclesiastes 9-4 But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
Ecclesiastes 9-5 For the living know that they will die, but <f>ⓗ</f>the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for <f>ⓘ</f>the memory of them is forgotten.
Ecclesiastes 9-6 Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 9-7 <pb/>Go, <f>ⓙ</f>eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.
Ecclesiastes 9-8 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Let your garments be always white. Let not <f>ⓛ</f>oil be lacking on your head.
Ecclesiastes 9-9 <pb/>Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your <f>ⓜ</f>vain <f>[2]</f> life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your <f>ⓝ</f>portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 9-10 Whatever your hand finds to do, <f>ⓞ</f>do it with your might, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.
Ecclesiastes 9-11 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Again I saw that under the sun <f>ⓡ</f>the race is not to the swift, nor <f>ⓢ</f>the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and <f>ⓣ</f>chance <f>ⓤ</f>happen to them all.
Ecclesiastes 9-12 For man <f>ⓥ</f>does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and <f>ⓦ</f>like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are <f>ⓧ</f>snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.
Ecclesiastes 9-13 <pb/>I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.
Ecclesiastes 9-14 There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.
Ecclesiastes 9-15 But there was found in it <f>ⓨ</f>a poor, wise man, and he by his <f>ⓩ</f>wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
Ecclesiastes 9-16 But I say that <f>ⓐ</f>wisdom is better than might, though <f>ⓑ</f>the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.
Ecclesiastes 9-17 <pb/>The words of the wise heard in <f>ⓒ</f>quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
Ecclesiastes 9-18 <f>ⓓ</f> Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but <f>ⓔ</f>one sinner destroys much good.
