Malachi 2-1 <pb/>“And now, <f>ⓐ</f>O priests, <f>ⓑ</f>this command is for you.
Malachi 2-2 <f>ⓒ</f> If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the LORD of hosts, then I will send <f>ⓓ</f>the curse upon you and I will curse <f>ⓔ</f>your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.
Malachi 2-3 Behold, <f>ⓕ</f>I will rebuke your offspring, <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>spread dung on your faces, the <f>ⓗ</f>dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it. <f>[2]</f>
Malachi 2-4 So shall you know that I have sent <f>ⓘ</f>this command to you, that <f>ⓙ</f>my covenant with Levi may stand, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 2-5 My covenant with him was one of life and <f>ⓚ</f>peace, and I gave them to him. <f>ⓛ</f>It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name.
Malachi 2-6 <f>ⓜ</f> True instruction <f>[3]</f> was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he <f>ⓝ</f>turned many from iniquity.
Malachi 2-7 For <f>ⓞ</f>the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people <f>[4]</f> should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 2-8 But you have turned aside from the way. <f>ⓟ</f>You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted <f>ⓠ</f>the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts,
Malachi 2-9 and so <f>ⓡ</f>I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but <f>ⓢ</f>show partiality in your instruction.”
Malachi 2-10 <pb/>Have we not all <f>ⓣ</f>one Father? Has not <f>ⓤ</f>one God created us? Why then are we <f>ⓥ</f>faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
Malachi 2-11 Judah has been <f>ⓦ</f>faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For <f>ⓧ</f>Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
Malachi 2-12 May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant <f>[5]</f> of the man who does this, who <f>ⓨ</f>brings an offering to the LORD of hosts!
Malachi 2-13 <pb/>And this second thing you do. <f>ⓩ</f>You cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand.
Malachi 2-14 <f>ⓐ</f> But you say, “Why does he not?” Because the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>was witness between you and the wife of your youth, <f>ⓒ</f>to whom <f>ⓓ</f>you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
Malachi 2-15 <f>ⓔ</f> Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? <f>[6]</f> And what was the one God <f>[7]</f> seeking? <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>Godly offspring. So guard yourselves <f>[9]</f> in your spirit, and let none of you be <f>ⓖ</f>faithless to the wife of your youth.
Malachi 2-16 “For <f>ⓗ</f>the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, <f>[10]</f> says the LORD, the God of Israel, covers <f>[11]</f> his garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and <f>ⓘ</f>do not be faithless.”
Malachi 2-17 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> You have wearied the LORD with your words. <f>ⓚ</f>But you say, “How have we wearied him?” <f>ⓛ</f>By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them.” Or by asking, <f>ⓜ</f>“Where is the God of justice?”
