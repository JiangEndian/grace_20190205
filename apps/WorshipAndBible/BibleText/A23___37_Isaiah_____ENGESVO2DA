Isaiah 37-3 They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a <f>ⓒ</f>day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; <f>ⓓ</f>children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.
Isaiah 37-4 <f>ⓔ</f> It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for <f>ⓕ</f>the remnant that is left.’”
Isaiah 37-5 <pb/>When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,

Isaiah 37-7 Behold, <f>ⓖ</f>I will put a spirit in him, so that <f>ⓗ</f>he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and <f>ⓘ</f>I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’”
Isaiah 37-8 <pb/>The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against <f>ⓙ</f>Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left <f>ⓚ</f>Lachish.
Isaiah 37-9 Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of <f>ⓛ</f>Cush, <f>[1]</f> “He has set out to fight against you.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Isaiah 37-10 “Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: <f>ⓜ</f>‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah 37-11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered?

Isaiah 37-13 <f>ⓠ</f> Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’”
Isaiah 37-14 <pb/>Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
Isaiah 37-15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD:
Isaiah 37-16 “O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, <f>ⓡ</f>enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; <f>ⓢ</f>you have made heaven and earth.
Isaiah 37-17 <f>ⓣ</f> Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear <f>ⓤ</f>all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.
Isaiah 37-18 Truly, O LORD, <f>ⓥ</f>the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,
Isaiah 37-19 and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.
Isaiah 37-20 So now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the LORD.”
Isaiah 37-21 <pb/>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
Isaiah 37-22 this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: <pb/><t>“‘She despises you, she scorns you — </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>the virgin daughter of Zion; </t><t>she wags her head behind you — </t><t>the daughter of Jerusalem. </t>

Isaiah 37-24 <t>By your servants you have mocked the Lord, </t><t>and you have said, <f>ⓨ</f>With my many chariots </t><t>I have gone up the heights of the mountains, </t><t>to the far recesses of Lebanon, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>to cut down its tallest cedars, </t><t>its choicest cypresses, </t><t>to come to its remotest height, </t><t>its most fruitful forest.</t>
Isaiah 37-25 <t>I dug wells </t><t>and drank waters, </t><t>to dry up with the sole of my foot </t><t>all <f>ⓐ</f>the streams <f>ⓑ</f>of Egypt. </t>

Isaiah 37-27 <t>while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, </t><t>are dismayed and confounded, </t><t>and have become like plants of the field </t><t>and like tender grass, </t><t>like grass on the housetops, </t><t>blighted <f>[2]</f> before it is grown. </t>
Isaiah 37-28 <pb/><t>“‘I know your sitting down </t><t>and your going out and coming in, </t><t>and your raging against me.</t>
Isaiah 37-29 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Because you have raged against me </t><t>and your complacency has come to my ears, </t><t>I will put my hook in your nose </t><t>and my bit in your mouth, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>I will turn you back on the way </t><t>by which you came.’ </t>
Isaiah 37-30 <pb/>“And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that. Then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
Isaiah 37-31 And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah <f>ⓕ</f>shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah 37-32 <f>ⓖ</f> For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. <f>ⓗ</f>The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
Isaiah 37-33 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or <f>ⓘ</f>cast up a siege mound against it.
