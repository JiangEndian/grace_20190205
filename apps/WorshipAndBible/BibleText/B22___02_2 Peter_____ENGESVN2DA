2 Peter 2-1 <pb/>But <f>ⓐ</f>false prophets also arose among the people, <f>ⓑ</f>just as there will be false teachers among you, who will <f>ⓒ</f>secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master <f>ⓓ</f>who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
2 Peter 2-2 And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth <f>ⓔ</f>will be blasphemed.
2 Peter 2-3 And <f>ⓕ</f>in their greed they will exploit you <f>ⓖ</f>with false words. <f>ⓗ</f>Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
2 Peter 2-4 <pb/>For if God did not spare <f>ⓘ</f>angels when they sinned, but <f>ⓙ</f>cast them into hell <f>[1]</f> and committed them to chains <f>[2]</f> of gloomy darkness <f>ⓚ</f>to be kept until the judgment;
2 Peter 2-5 if he did not spare the ancient world, but <f>ⓛ</f>preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought <f>ⓜ</f>a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
2 Peter 2-6 if by <f>ⓝ</f>turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction, <f>ⓞ</f>making them an example of <f>ⓟ</f>what is going to happen to the ungodly; <f>[3]</f>
2 Peter 2-7 and <f>ⓠ</f>if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked
2 Peter 2-8 (for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, <f>ⓡ</f>he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard);
2 Peter 2-9 then <f>ⓢ</f>the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, <f>[4]</f> and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,
2 Peter 2-10 and especially <f>ⓣ</f>those who indulge <f>[5]</f> in the lust of defiling passion and <f>ⓤ</f>despise authority. <pb/>Bold and willful, they do not tremble <f>ⓥ</f>as they blaspheme the glorious ones,
2 Peter 2-11 <f>ⓦ</f> whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord.
2 Peter 2-12 <f>ⓧ</f> But these, like irrational animals, <f>ⓨ</f>creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction,
2 Peter 2-13 suffering wrong as <f>ⓩ</f>the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure <f>ⓐ</f>to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, <f>[6]</f> while <f>ⓑ</f>they feast with you.
2 Peter 2-14 They have eyes full of adultery, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts <f>ⓓ</f>trained in greed. <f>ⓔ</f>Accursed children!
2 Peter 2-15 Forsaking the right way, <f>ⓕ</f>they have gone astray. They have followed <f>ⓖ</f>the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved <f>ⓗ</f>gain from wrongdoing,
2 Peter 2-16 but was rebuked for his own transgression; <f>ⓘ</f>a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
2 Peter 2-17 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm. <f>ⓚ</f>For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved.
2 Peter 2-18 For, <f>ⓛ</f>speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely <f>ⓜ</f>escaping from those who live in error.
2 Peter 2-19 They promise them <f>ⓝ</f>freedom, <f>ⓞ</f>but they themselves are slaves <f>[8]</f> of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.
2 Peter 2-20 For if, <f>ⓟ</f>after they have escaped the defilements of the world <f>ⓠ</f>through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, <f>ⓡ</f>the last state has become worse for them than the first.
2 Peter 2-21 For <f>ⓢ</f>it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from <f>ⓣ</f>the holy commandment delivered to them.
2 Peter 2-22 What the true proverb says has happened to them: “The <f>ⓤ</f>dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire.”
