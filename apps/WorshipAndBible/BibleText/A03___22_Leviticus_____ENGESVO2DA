Leviticus 22-1 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22-2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons so that they <f>ⓐ</f>abstain from the holy things of the people of Israel, which they <f>ⓑ</f>dedicate to me, so that they do not <f>ⓒ</f>profane my holy name: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22-3 Say to them, ‘If any one of all your offspring throughout your generations approaches the holy things that the people of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while <f>ⓓ</f>he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22-4 None of the offspring of Aaron who has a leprous disease or a <f>ⓔ</f>discharge may eat of the holy things <f>ⓕ</f>until he is clean. <f>ⓖ</f>Whoever touches anything that is unclean through contact with the dead or <f>ⓗ</f>a man who has had an emission of semen,
Leviticus 22-5 and <f>ⓘ</f>whoever touches a swarming thing by which he may be made unclean or <f>ⓙ</f>a person from whom he may take uncleanness, whatever his uncleanness may be —
Leviticus 22-6 the person who touches such a thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has <f>ⓚ</f>bathed his body in water.
Leviticus 22-7 When the sun goes down he shall be clean, and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because <f>ⓛ</f>they are his food.
Leviticus 22-8 <f>ⓜ</f> He shall not eat what dies of itself or is torn by beasts, and so make himself unclean by it: I am the LORD.’
Leviticus 22-9 They shall therefore keep my charge, <f>ⓝ</f>lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: <f>ⓞ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
Leviticus 22-10 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> “A lay person shall not eat of a holy thing; no foreign guest of the priest or hired worker shall eat of a holy thing,
Leviticus 22-11 but if a priest buys a slave <f>[1]</f> as his property for money, the slave <f>[2]</f> may eat of it, and <f>ⓠ</f>anyone born in his house may eat of his food.
Leviticus 22-12 If a priest's daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy things.
Leviticus 22-13 But if a priest's daughter is widowed or divorced and has no child and <f>ⓡ</f>returns to her father's house, <f>ⓢ</f>as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; yet no lay person shall eat of it.
Leviticus 22-14 <f>ⓣ</f> And if anyone eats of a holy thing unintentionally, he shall add <f>ⓤ</f>the fifth of its value to it and give the holy thing to the priest.
Leviticus 22-15 They <f>ⓥ</f>shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, which they contribute to the LORD,
Leviticus 22-16 and so cause them <f>ⓦ</f>to bear iniquity and guilt, by eating their holy things: <f>ⓧ</f>for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”
Leviticus 22-17 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22-18 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them, <f>ⓨ</f>When any one of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel presents a burnt offering as his offering, for any of their vows or freewill offerings that they offer to the LORD,
Leviticus 22-19 if it is to be accepted for you it shall be a <f>ⓩ</f>male without blemish, of the bulls or the sheep or the goats.
Leviticus 22-20 <f>ⓐ</f> You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable for you.
Leviticus 22-21 And when anyone <f>ⓑ</f>offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock, to be accepted it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it.
Leviticus 22-22 Animals <f>ⓓ</f>blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or <f>ⓔ</f>an itch or scabs you shall not offer to the LORD or give them to the LORD as a food <f>ⓕ</f>offering on the altar.
Leviticus 22-23 You may present a bull or a lamb that has a part <f>ⓖ</f>too long or too short for a freewill offering, but for a vow offering it cannot be accepted.
Leviticus 22-24 Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not offer to the LORD; you shall not do it within your land,
Leviticus 22-25 neither shall you offer as <f>ⓗ</f>the bread of your God any such animals gotten from a foreigner. Since there is a <f>ⓘ</f>blemish in them, because of their mutilation, they will not be accepted for you.”
Leviticus 22-26 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22-27 <f>ⓙ</f> “When an ox or sheep or goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as a food offering to the LORD.
Leviticus 22-28 But you shall not kill an ox or a sheep <f>ⓚ</f>and her young in one day.
Leviticus 22-29 And when you sacrifice a <f>ⓛ</f>sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
Leviticus 22-30 It shall be eaten on the same day; <f>ⓜ</f>you shall leave none of it until morning: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22-31 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> “So you shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22-32 <f>ⓞ</f> And you shall not profane my holy name, that <f>ⓟ</f>I may be sanctified among the people of Israel. <f>ⓠ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies you,
Leviticus 22-33 who brought you out of the land of Egypt <f>ⓡ</f>to be your God: I am the LORD.”
