Hebrews 12-1 <pb/>Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and <f>ⓐ</f>sin which clings so closely, and <f>ⓑ</f>let us run <f>ⓒ</f>with endurance the race that is <f>ⓓ</f>set before us,
Hebrews 12-2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, <f>ⓔ</f>who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising <f>ⓕ</f>the shame, and <f>ⓖ</f>is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews 12-3 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or <f>ⓘ</f>fainthearted.
Hebrews 12-4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
Hebrews 12-5 And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“My son, <f>ⓚ</f>do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, </t><t>nor be weary when reproved by him.</t>
Hebrews 12-6 <t>For <f>ⓛ</f>the Lord disciplines the one he loves, </t><t>and chastises every son whom he receives.” </t>
Hebrews 12-7 <pb/>It is for discipline that you have to endure. <f>ⓜ</f>God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
Hebrews 12-8 If you are left without discipline, <f>ⓝ</f>in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
Hebrews 12-9 Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to <f>ⓞ</f>the Father of spirits <f>ⓟ</f>and live?
Hebrews 12-10 For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, <f>ⓠ</f>that we may share his holiness.
Hebrews 12-11 <f>ⓡ</f> For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields <f>ⓢ</f>the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
Hebrews 12-12 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓣ</f>lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,
Hebrews 12-13 and <f>ⓤ</f>make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint <f>ⓥ</f>but rather be healed.
Hebrews 12-14 <f>ⓦ</f> Strive for peace with everyone, and for the <f>ⓧ</f>holiness <f>ⓨ</f>without which no one will see the Lord.
Hebrews 12-15 See to it that no one <f>ⓩ</f>fails to obtain the grace of God; that no <f>ⓐ</f>“root of bitterness” springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;
Hebrews 12-16 that no one is <f>ⓑ</f>sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
Hebrews 12-17 For you know that <f>ⓒ</f>afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.
Hebrews 12-18 <pb/>For you have not come to <f>ⓓ</f>what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest
Hebrews 12-19 and <f>ⓔ</f>the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words <f>ⓕ</f>made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them.
Hebrews 12-20 For they could not endure the order that was given, <f>ⓖ</f>“If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.”
Hebrews 12-21 Indeed, <f>ⓗ</f>so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.”
Hebrews 12-22 But you have come to <f>ⓘ</f>Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, <f>ⓙ</f>the heavenly Jerusalem, and to <f>ⓚ</f>innumerable angels in festal gathering,
Hebrews 12-23 and to <f>ⓛ</f>the assembly <f>[1]</f> of the firstborn who are <f>ⓜ</f>enrolled in heaven, and to <f>ⓝ</f>God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
Hebrews 12-24 and to Jesus, <f>ⓞ</f>the mediator of a new covenant, and to <f>ⓟ</f>the sprinkled blood <f>ⓠ</f>that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
Hebrews 12-25 <pb/>See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For <f>ⓡ</f>if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven.
Hebrews 12-26 At that time <f>ⓢ</f>his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, <f>ⓣ</f>“Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”
Hebrews 12-27 This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates <f>ⓤ</f>the removal of things that are shaken — that is, things that have been made — in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain.
Hebrews 12-28 Therefore let us be grateful for receiving <f>ⓥ</f>a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus <f>ⓦ</f>let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe,
Hebrews 12-29 for our <f>ⓧ</f>God is a consuming fire.
