Mark 13-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!”
Mark 13-2 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Do you see these great buildings? <f>ⓑ</f>There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”</J>
Mark 13-3 <pb/>And as he sat on <f>ⓒ</f>the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, <f>ⓓ</f>Peter and James and John and <f>ⓔ</f>Andrew asked him <f>ⓕ</f>privately,
Mark 13-4 “Tell us, <f>ⓖ</f>when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?”
Mark 13-5 And Jesus began to say to them, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“See that no one leads you astray.</J>
Mark 13-6 <J><f>ⓘ</f> Many will come in my name, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>‘I am he!’ and they will lead many astray.</J>
Mark 13-7 <J>And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, <f>ⓚ</f>do not be alarmed. This <f>ⓛ</f>must take place, but the end is not yet.</J>
Mark 13-8 <J>For <f>ⓜ</f>nation will rise against nation, and <f>ⓝ</f>kingdom against kingdom. There will be <f>ⓞ</f>earthquakes in various places; there will be <f>ⓟ</f>famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains.</J>
Mark 13-9 <pb/><J><f>ⓠ</f> “But <f>ⓡ</f>be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, and you will be beaten <f>ⓢ</f>in synagogues, and you will stand before <f>ⓣ</f>governors and <f>ⓤ</f>kings for my sake, <f>ⓥ</f>to bear witness before them.</J>
Mark 13-10 <J>And the gospel must first be proclaimed <f>ⓦ</f>to all nations.</J>
Mark 13-11 <J>And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, <f>ⓧ</f>do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say <f>ⓨ</f>whatever is given you in that hour, <f>ⓩ</f>for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</J>
Mark 13-12 <J><f>ⓐ</f> And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death.</J>
Mark 13-13 <J><f>ⓑ</f> And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. <f>ⓒ</f>But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</J>
Mark 13-14 <pb/><J>“But when you see <f>ⓓ</f>the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not to be (<f>ⓔ</f>let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</J>
Mark 13-15 <J><f>ⓕ</f> Let the one who is on <f>ⓖ</f>the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything out,</J>
Mark 13-16 <J>and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.</J>
Mark 13-17 <J>And <f>ⓗ</f>alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days!</J>
Mark 13-18 <J>Pray that it may not happen in winter.</J>
Mark 13-19 <J>For in those days there will be <f>ⓘ</f>such <f>ⓙ</f>tribulation as has not been <f>ⓚ</f>from the beginning of the creation that <f>ⓛ</f>God created until now, and never will be.</J>
Mark 13-20 <J>And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be saved. But for <f>ⓜ</f>the sake of the elect, whom <f>ⓝ</f>he chose, he shortened the days.</J>
Mark 13-21 <J>And <f>ⓞ</f>then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it.</J>
Mark 13-22 <J><f>ⓟ</f> For false christs and false prophets will arise and <f>ⓠ</f>perform signs and wonders, <f>ⓡ</f>to lead astray, if possible, <f>ⓢ</f>the elect.</J>
Mark 13-23 <J>But <f>ⓣ</f>be on guard; <f>ⓤ</f>I have told you all things beforehand.</J>
Mark 13-24 <pb/><J>“But in those days, after <f>ⓥ</f>that tribulation, <f>ⓦ</f>the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,</J>
Mark 13-25 <J>and <f>ⓧ</f>the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</J>
Mark 13-26 <J>And then they will see <f>ⓨ</f>the Son of Man coming in clouds <f>ⓩ</f>with great power and glory.</J>
Mark 13-27 <J>And then <f>ⓐ</f>he will send out the angels and <f>ⓑ</f>gather <f>ⓒ</f>his elect from <f>ⓓ</f>the four winds, from <f>ⓔ</f>the ends of the earth <f>ⓕ</f>to the ends of heaven.</J>
Mark 13-28 <pb/><J>“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.</J>
Mark 13-29 <J>So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, <f>ⓖ</f>at the very gates.</J>
Mark 13-30 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.</J>
Mark 13-31 <J><f>ⓘ</f> Heaven and earth will pass away, but <f>ⓙ</f>my words will not pass away.</J>
Mark 13-32 <pb/><J>“But concerning that day or that hour, <f>ⓚ</f>no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, <f>ⓛ</f>nor the Son, <f>ⓜ</f>but only the Father.</J>
Mark 13-33 <J><f>ⓝ</f> Be on guard, <f>ⓞ</f>keep awake. <f>[1]</f> For you do not know when the time will come.</J>
Mark 13-34 <J><f>ⓟ</f> It is like a man <f>ⓠ</f>going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants <f>[2]</f> in charge, <f>ⓡ</f>each with his work, and commands <f>ⓢ</f>the doorkeeper to stay awake.</J>
Mark 13-35 <J><f>ⓣ</f> Therefore stay awake — for you do not know when the master of the house will come, <f>ⓤ</f>in the evening, or <f>ⓥ</f>at midnight, or <f>ⓦ</f>when the rooster crows, <f>[3]</f> or <f>ⓧ</f>in the morning — </J>
Mark 13-36 <J>lest <f>ⓨ</f>he come suddenly and <f>ⓩ</f>find you asleep.</J>
Mark 13-37 <J>And what I say to you I say to all: <f>ⓐ</f>Stay awake.”</J>
