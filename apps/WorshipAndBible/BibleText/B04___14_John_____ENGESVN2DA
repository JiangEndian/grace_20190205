John 14-1 <pb/><J><f>ⓐ</f> “Let not your hearts be troubled. <f>ⓑ</f>Believe in God; <f>[1]</f> believe also in me.</J>
John 14-2 <J>In <f>ⓒ</f>my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that <f>ⓓ</f>I go to prepare a place for you? <f>[2]</f></J>
John 14-3 <J>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you <f>ⓔ</f>to myself, that <f>ⓕ</f>where I am you may be also.</J>
John 14-4 <J>And you know the way to where I am going.” <f>[3]</f></J>
John 14-5 <f>ⓖ</f> Thomas said to him, “Lord, <f>ⓗ</f>we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?”
John 14-6 Jesus said to him, <J>“I am <f>ⓘ</f>the way, and <f>ⓙ</f>the truth, and <f>ⓚ</f>the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</J>
John 14-7 <J><f>ⓛ</f> If you had known me, you would have <f>ⓜ</f>known my Father also. <f>[4]</f> From now on you do know him and <f>ⓝ</f>have seen him.”</J>
John 14-8 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Philip said to him, “Lord, <f>ⓟ</f>show us the Father, and it is enough for us.”
John 14-9 Jesus said to him, <J>“Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? <f>ⓠ</f>Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?</J>
John 14-10 <J>Do you not believe that <f>ⓡ</f>I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you <f>ⓢ</f>I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works.</J>
John 14-11 <J>Believe me that <f>ⓣ</f>I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else <f>ⓤ</f>believe on account of the works themselves.</J>
John 14-12 <pb/><J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓥ</f>whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I <f>ⓦ</f>am going to the Father.</J>
John 14-13 <J><f>ⓧ</f> Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that <f>ⓨ</f>the Father may be glorified in the Son.</J>
John 14-14 <J><f>ⓩ</f> If you ask me <f>[5]</f> anything in my name, I will do it.</J>
John 14-15 <pb/><J><f>ⓐ</f> “If you love me, you will <f>ⓑ</f>keep my commandments.</J>
John 14-16 <J>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another <f>ⓒ</f>Helper, <f>[6]</f> to be with you forever,</J>
John 14-17 <J>even <f>ⓓ</f>the Spirit of truth, <f>ⓔ</f>whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and <f>ⓕ</f>will be <f>[7]</f> in you.</J>
John 14-18 <pb/><J>“I will not leave you as orphans; <f>ⓖ</f>I will come to you.</J>
John 14-19 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but <f>ⓘ</f>you will see me. <f>ⓙ</f>Because I live, you also will live.</J>
John 14-20 <J><f>ⓚ</f> In that day you will know that <f>ⓛ</f>I am in my Father, and <f>ⓜ</f>you in me, and <f>ⓝ</f>I in you.</J>
John 14-21 <J><f>ⓞ</f> Whoever has my commandments and <f>ⓟ</f>keeps them, he it is who loves me. And <f>ⓠ</f>he who loves me <f>ⓡ</f>will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and <f>ⓢ</f>manifest myself to him.”</J>
John 14-22 <f>ⓣ</f> Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it <f>ⓤ</f>that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?”
John 14-23 Jesus answered him, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and <f>ⓦ</f>we will come to him and <f>ⓧ</f>make our home with him.</J>
John 14-24 <J>Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And <f>ⓨ</f>the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.</J>
John 14-25 <pb/><J>“These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you.</J>
John 14-26 <J>But the <f>ⓩ</f>Helper, the Holy Spirit, <f>ⓐ</f>whom the Father will send in my name, <f>ⓑ</f>he will teach you all things and <f>ⓒ</f>bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.</J>
John 14-27 <J><f>ⓓ</f> Peace I leave with you; <f>ⓔ</f>my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. <f>ⓕ</f>Let not your hearts be troubled, neither <f>ⓖ</f>let them be afraid.</J>
John 14-28 <J><f>ⓗ</f> You heard me say to you, <f>ⓘ</f>‘I am going away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I <f>ⓙ</f>am going to the Father, for <f>ⓚ</f>the Father is greater than I.</J>
John 14-29 <J>And <f>ⓛ</f>now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place you may believe.</J>
John 14-30 <J>I will no longer talk much with you, for <f>ⓜ</f>the ruler of this world is coming. <f>ⓝ</f>He has no claim on me,</J>
John 14-31 <J>but I do <f>ⓞ</f>as the Father has commanded me, <f>ⓟ</f>so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here.</J>
