Mark 15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests <f>ⓑ</f>held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And <f>ⓒ</f>they bound Jesus and <f>ⓓ</f>led him away and <f>ⓔ</f>delivered him over to <f>ⓕ</f>Pilate.
Mark 15-2 <f>ⓖ</f> And Pilate asked him, <f>ⓗ</f>“Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“You have said so.”</J>
Mark 15-3 And the chief priests accused him of many things.
Mark 15-4 And Pilate again asked him, <f>ⓙ</f>“Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.”
Mark 15-5 But Jesus <f>ⓚ</f>made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.
Mark 15-6 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked.
Mark 15-7 And among the rebels in prison, who had <f>ⓜ</f>committed murder <f>ⓝ</f>in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas.
Mark 15-8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them.
Mark 15-9 And he answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”
Mark 15-10 For he perceived that <f>ⓞ</f>it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.
Mark 15-11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.
Mark 15-12 And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with <f>ⓟ</f>the man you call the King of the Jews?”
Mark 15-13 And they cried out again, “Crucify him.”
Mark 15-14 And Pilate said to them, “Why? <f>ⓠ</f>What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.”
Mark 15-15 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having <f>ⓡ</f>scourged <f>[1]</f> Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
Mark 15-16 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> And the soldiers led him away inside <f>ⓣ</f>the palace (that is, <f>ⓤ</f>the governor's headquarters), <f>[2]</f> and they called together the whole <f>ⓥ</f>battalion. <f>[3]</f>
Mark 15-17 And they clothed him in <f>ⓦ</f>a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him.
Mark 15-18 And they began to salute him, <f>ⓧ</f>“Hail, King of the Jews!”
Mark 15-19 And they were striking his head with a reed and <f>ⓨ</f>spitting on him and <f>ⓩ</f>kneeling down in homage to him.
Mark 15-20 And when they had <f>ⓐ</f>mocked him, they stripped him of <f>ⓑ</f>the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they <f>ⓒ</f>led him out to crucify him.
Mark 15-21 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.
Mark 15-22 <f>ⓔ</f> And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull).
Mark 15-23 And they offered him wine mixed with <f>ⓕ</f>myrrh, but he did not take it.
Mark 15-24 And they crucified him and <f>ⓖ</f>divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
Mark 15-25 And <f>ⓗ</f>it was the third hour <f>[4]</f> when they crucified him.
Mark 15-26 And the inscription of the charge against him read, <f>ⓘ</f>“The King of the Jews.”
Mark 15-27 And with him they crucified two <f>ⓙ</f>robbers, <f>ⓚ</f>one on his right and one on his left. <f>[5]</f>
Mark 15-28 
Mark 15-29 And <f>ⓛ</f>those who passed by derided him, <f>ⓜ</f>wagging their heads and saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“Aha! <f>ⓞ</f>You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
Mark 15-30 save yourself, and come down from the cross!”
Mark 15-31 So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, <f>ⓟ</f>“He saved others; <f>ⓠ</f>he cannot save himself.
Mark 15-32 Let <f>ⓡ</f>the Christ, <f>ⓢ</f>the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may <f>ⓣ</f>see and believe.” <f>ⓤ</f>Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.
Mark 15-33 <pb/>And when the sixth hour <f>[6]</f> had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. <f>[7]</f>
Mark 15-34 And at the ninth hour Jesus <f>ⓥ</f>cried with a loud voice, <J> <f>ⓦ</f>“Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?”</J> which means, <J>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</J>
Mark 15-35 And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”
Mark 15-36 And someone ran and filled a sponge with <f>ⓧ</f>sour wine, put it on a reed <f>ⓨ</f>and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.”
Mark 15-37 And Jesus <f>ⓩ</f>uttered a loud cry and <f>ⓐ</f>breathed his last.
Mark 15-38 And <f>ⓑ</f>the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
Mark 15-39 <f>ⓒ</f> And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he <f>[8]</f> breathed his last, he said, <f>ⓓ</f>“Truly this man was the Son <f>[9]</f> of God!”
Mark 15-40 <pb/>There were also <f>ⓔ</f>women looking on <f>ⓕ</f>from a distance, among whom were <f>ⓖ</f>Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and <f>ⓗ</f>Salome.
Mark 15-41 When he was in Galilee, they followed him and <f>ⓘ</f>ministered to him, and there were also many other women who <f>ⓙ</f>came up with him to Jerusalem.
Mark 15-42 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> And when evening had come, since it was <f>ⓛ</f>the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
Mark 15-43 Joseph of Arimathea, <f>ⓜ</f>a respected member of the council, who <f>ⓝ</f>was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mark 15-44 Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. <f>[10]</f> And summoning <f>ⓞ</f>the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
Mark 15-45 And when he learned from <f>ⓟ</f>the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
Mark 15-46 And Joseph <f>[11]</f> bought <f>ⓠ</f>a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and <f>ⓡ</f>laid him in a tomb <f>ⓢ</f>that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled <f>ⓣ</f>a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
Mark 15-47 <f>ⓤ</f> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
