Acts 12-1 <pb/>About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.
Acts 12-2 He killed <f>ⓐ</f>James the brother of John <f>ⓑ</f>with the sword,
Acts 12-3 and when he saw <f>ⓒ</f>that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during <f>ⓓ</f>the days of Unleavened Bread.
Acts 12-4 And when he had seized him, he put him <f>ⓔ</f>in prison, delivering him over to four <f>ⓕ</f>squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.
Acts 12-5 So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest <f>ⓖ</f>prayer for him was made to God by the church.
Acts 12-6 <pb/>Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, <f>ⓗ</f>bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.
Acts 12-7 And behold, <f>ⓘ</f>an angel of the Lord <f>ⓙ</f>stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. <f>ⓚ</f>He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, “Get up quickly.” And <f>ⓛ</f>the chains fell off his hands.
Acts 12-8 And the angel said to him, “Dress yourself and <f>ⓜ</f>put on your sandals.” And he did so. And he said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.”
Acts 12-9 And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but <f>ⓝ</f>thought he was seeing a vision.
Acts 12-10 When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. <f>ⓞ</f>It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him.
Acts 12-11 When Peter <f>ⓟ</f>came to himself, he said, “Now I am sure that <f>ⓠ</f>the Lord has sent his angel and <f>ⓡ</f>rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”
Acts 12-12 <pb/>When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of <f>ⓢ</f>John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and <f>ⓣ</f>were praying.
Acts 12-13 And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, <f>ⓤ</f>a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
Acts 12-14 Recognizing Peter's voice, <f>ⓥ</f>in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate.
Acts 12-15 They said to her, “You are out of your mind.” But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, “It is <f>ⓦ</f>his angel!”
Acts 12-16 But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.
Acts 12-17 But <f>ⓧ</f>motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Tell these things to <f>ⓨ</f>James and to <f>ⓩ</f>the brothers.” <f>[1]</f> Then he departed and went to another place.
Acts 12-18 <pb/>Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
Acts 12-19 And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and <f>ⓐ</f>ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.
Acts 12-20 <pb/>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and <f>ⓑ</f>having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, <f>[2]</f> they asked for peace, because <f>ⓒ</f>their country depended on the king's country for food.
Acts 12-21 On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them.
Acts 12-22 And the people were shouting, “The voice of a god, and not of a man!”
Acts 12-23 Immediately <f>ⓓ</f>an angel of the Lord struck him down, because <f>ⓔ</f>he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.
Acts 12-24 <pb/>But <f>ⓕ</f>the word of God increased and multiplied.
Acts 12-25 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And Barnabas and Saul returned from <f>[3]</f> Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them <f>ⓗ</f>John, whose other name was Mark.
