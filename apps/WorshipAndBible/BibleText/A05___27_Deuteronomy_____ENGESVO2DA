Deuteronomy 27-1 <pb/>Now Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, “Keep the whole commandment that I command you today.
Deuteronomy 27-2 And on the day <f>ⓐ</f>you cross over the Jordan to the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall set up large stones and plaster them with plaster.
Deuteronomy 27-3 <f>ⓑ</f> And you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you cross over to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, <f>ⓒ</f>a land flowing with milk and honey, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
Deuteronomy 27-4 And when you have crossed over the Jordan, you shall set up these stones, concerning which I command you today, <f>ⓓ</f>on Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
Deuteronomy 27-5 And there you shall build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. <f>ⓔ</f>You shall wield no iron tool on them;
Deuteronomy 27-6 you shall build an altar to the LORD your God of uncut <f>[1]</f> stones. And you shall offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God,
Deuteronomy 27-7 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and <f>ⓕ</f>shall eat there, and you <f>ⓖ</f>shall rejoice before the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy 27-8 And <f>ⓗ</f>you shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.”
Deuteronomy 27-9 <pb/>Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, “Keep silence and hear, O Israel: <f>ⓘ</f>this day you have become the people of the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy 27-10 You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God, keeping his commandments and his statutes, which I command you today.”
Deuteronomy 27-11 <pb/>That day Moses charged the people, saying,
