Mark 8-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them,
Mark 8-2 <J><f>ⓑ</f> “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat.</J>
Mark 8-3 <J>And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come from far away.”</J>
Mark 8-4 And his disciples answered him, “How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place?”
Mark 8-5 And he asked them, <J>“How many loaves do you have?”</J> They said, <f>ⓒ</f>“Seven.”
Mark 8-6 And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and <f>ⓓ</f>having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.
Mark 8-7 And they had a few small fish. And <f>ⓔ</f>having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them.
Mark 8-8 And <f>ⓕ</f>they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, <f>ⓖ</f>seven baskets full.
Mark 8-9 And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away.
Mark 8-10 And immediately he got into <f>ⓗ</f>the boat with his disciples and went to the district of <f>ⓘ</f>Dalmanutha. <f>[1]</f>
Mark 8-11 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, <f>ⓚ</f>seeking from him <f>ⓛ</f>a sign from heaven <f>ⓜ</f>to test him.
Mark 8-12 And <f>ⓝ</f>he sighed deeply <f>ⓞ</f>in his spirit and said, <J>“Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</J>
Mark 8-13 And <f>ⓟ</f>he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.
Mark 8-14 <pb/>Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
Mark 8-15 And he cautioned them, saying, <J>“Watch out; <f>ⓠ</f>beware of <f>ⓡ</f>the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of <f>ⓢ</f>Herod.” <f>[2]</f></J>
Mark 8-16 And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.
Mark 8-17 And <f>ⓣ</f>Jesus, aware of this, said to them, <J>“Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? <f>ⓤ</f>Do you not yet perceive <f>ⓥ</f>or understand? <f>ⓦ</f>Are your hearts hardened?</J>
Mark 8-18 <J><f>ⓧ</f> Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?</J>
Mark 8-19 <J>When I broke <f>ⓨ</f>the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?”</J> They said to him, “Twelve.”
Mark 8-20 <J>“And <f>ⓩ</f>the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?”</J> And they said to him, “Seven.”
Mark 8-21 And he said to them, <J>“Do you not yet understand?”</J>
Mark 8-22 <pb/>And they came <f>ⓐ</f>to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him.
Mark 8-23 And <f>ⓑ</f>he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when <f>ⓒ</f>he had <f>ⓓ</f>spit on his eyes and <f>ⓔ</f>laid his hands on him, he asked him, <J>“Do you see anything?”</J>
Mark 8-24 And he looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees, walking.”
Mark 8-25 Then Jesus <f>[3]</f> laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
Mark 8-26 And he sent him to his home, saying, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Do not even enter the village.”</J>
Mark 8-27 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, <J>“Who do people say that I am?”</J>
Mark 8-28 And they told him, <f>ⓗ</f>“John the Baptist; and others say, <f>ⓘ</f>Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”
Mark 8-29 And he asked them, <J>“But who do you say that I am?”</J> Peter answered him, <f>ⓙ</f>“You are <f>ⓚ</f>the Christ.”
Mark 8-30 <f>ⓛ</f> And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.
Mark 8-31 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> And he began to teach them that <f>ⓝ</f>the Son of Man must <f>ⓞ</f>suffer many things and <f>ⓟ</f>be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and <f>ⓠ</f>after three days rise again.
Mark 8-32 And he said this <f>ⓡ</f>plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
Mark 8-33 But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“Get behind me, Satan! For you <f>ⓣ</f>are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”</J>
Mark 8-34 <pb/>And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, <J>“If anyone would come after me, let him <f>ⓤ</f>deny himself and <f>ⓥ</f>take up his cross and follow me.</J>
Mark 8-35 <J>For <f>ⓦ</f>whoever would save his life <f>[4]</f> will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake <f>ⓧ</f>and the gospel's will save it.</J>
Mark 8-36 <J><f>ⓨ</f> For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?</J>
Mark 8-37 <J>For <f>ⓩ</f>what can a man give in return for his soul?</J>
Mark 8-38 <J>For <f>ⓐ</f>whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this <f>ⓑ</f>adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed <f>ⓒ</f>when he comes in the glory of his Father with <f>ⓓ</f>the holy angels.”</J>
