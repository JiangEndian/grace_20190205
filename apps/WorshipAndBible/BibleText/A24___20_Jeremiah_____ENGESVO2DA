Jeremiah 20-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>Pashhur the priest, the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Immer, who was <f>ⓒ</f>chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
Jeremiah 20-2 Then <f>ⓓ</f>Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him <f>ⓔ</f>in the stocks that were in the upper <f>ⓕ</f>Benjamin Gate of the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah 20-3 The next day, when <f>ⓖ</f>Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD does not call your name <f>ⓗ</f>Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side.
Jeremiah 20-4 For thus says the LORD: Behold, I will make you <f>ⓘ</f>a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword.
Jeremiah 20-5 Moreover, <f>ⓙ</f>I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its <f>ⓚ</f>prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
Jeremiah 20-6 And you, <f>ⓛ</f>Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, <f>ⓜ</f>to whom you have prophesied falsely.”
Jeremiah 20-7 <pb/><t>O LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>you have deceived me, </t><t>and I was deceived; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>you are stronger than I, </t><t>and you have prevailed. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>I have become a laughingstock all the day; </t><t>everyone mocks me.</t>
Jeremiah 20-8 <t>For whenever I speak, I cry out, </t><t>I shout, <f>ⓠ</f>“Violence and destruction!” </t><t>For <f>ⓡ</f>the word of the LORD has become for me </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>a reproach and <f>ⓣ</f>derision all day long.</t>
Jeremiah 20-9 <t>If I say, “I will not mention him, </t><t>or speak any more in his name,” </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>there is in my heart as it were a burning fire </t><t>shut up in my bones, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>I am weary with holding it in, </t><t>and I cannot.</t>
Jeremiah 20-10 <t><f>ⓦ</f> For I hear many whispering. </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>Terror is on every side! </t><t>“Denounce him! <f>ⓨ</f>Let us denounce him!” </t><t>say all my <f>ⓩ</f>close friends, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>watching for <f>ⓑ</f>my fall. </t><t>“Perhaps he will be deceived; </t><t>then <f>ⓒ</f>we can overcome him </t><t>and take our revenge on him.”</t>
Jeremiah 20-11 <t>But <f>ⓓ</f>the LORD is with me as a dread warrior; </t><t>therefore my persecutors will stumble; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>they will not overcome me. </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>They will be greatly shamed, </t><t>for they will not succeed. </t><t>Their <f>ⓖ</f>eternal dishonor </t><t>will never be forgotten.</t>
Jeremiah 20-12 <t>O LORD of hosts, who tests the righteous, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>who sees the heart and the mind, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>let me see your vengeance upon them, </t><t>for to you have I committed my cause. </t>
Jeremiah 20-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Sing to the LORD; </t><t>praise the LORD! </t><t>For he has delivered the life of the needy </t><t>from the hand of evildoers. </t>
Jeremiah 20-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Cursed be the day </t><t>on which I was born! </t><t>The day when my mother bore me, </t><t>let it not be blessed!</t>
Jeremiah 20-15 <t>Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, </t><t>“A son is born to you,” </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>making him very glad.</t>
Jeremiah 20-16 <t>Let that man be like <f>ⓛ</f>the cities </t><t>that the LORD overthrew without pity; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>let him hear a cry in the morning </t><t>and an alarm at noon,</t>
Jeremiah 20-17 <t><f>ⓝ</f> because he did not kill me in the womb; </t><t>so my mother would have been my grave, </t><t>and her womb forever great.</t>
Jeremiah 20-18 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Why did I come out from the womb </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>to see toil and sorrow, </t><t>and spend my days in shame? </t>
