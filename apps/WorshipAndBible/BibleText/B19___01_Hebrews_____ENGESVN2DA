Hebrews 1-1 <pb/>Long ago, at many times and <f>ⓐ</f>in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,
Hebrews 1-2 but <f>ⓑ</f>in these last days <f>ⓒ</f>he has spoken to us by <f>ⓓ</f>his Son, whom he appointed <f>ⓔ</f>the heir of all things, <f>ⓕ</f>through whom also he created <f>ⓖ</f>the world.
Hebrews 1-3 He is the radiance of the glory of God and <f>ⓗ</f>the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. <f>ⓘ</f>After making purification for sins, <f>ⓙ</f>he sat down <f>ⓚ</f>at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
Hebrews 1-4 having become as much superior to angels as the name <f>ⓛ</f>he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
Hebrews 1-5 <pb/>For to which of the angels did God ever say, <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“You are my Son, </t><t>today I have begotten you”? </t> <pb/>Or again, <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“I will be to him a father, </t><t>and he shall be to me a son”? </t>
Hebrews 1-6 <pb/>And again, when he brings <f>ⓞ</f>the firstborn into the world, he says, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f>“Let all God's angels worship him.” </t>
Hebrews 1-7 <pb/>Of the angels he says, <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f>“He makes his angels winds, </t><t>and his ministers a flame of fire.” </t>
Hebrews 1-8 <pb/>But of the Son he says, <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f>“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, </t><t>the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.</t>
Hebrews 1-9 <t>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; </t><t>therefore God, your God, <f>ⓢ</f>has anointed you </t><t>with <f>ⓣ</f>the oil of gladness beyond your companions.” </t>
Hebrews 1-10 <pb/>And, <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, </t><t>and the heavens are the work of your hands;</t>
Hebrews 1-11 <t>they will perish, but you remain; </t><t>they will all wear out like a garment,</t>
Hebrews 1-12 <t>like a robe you will roll them up, </t><t>like a garment they will be changed. <f>[1]</f> </t><t>But you are <f>ⓥ</f>the same, </t><t>and your years will have no end.” </t>
Hebrews 1-13 <pb/>And to which of the angels has he ever said, <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f>“Sit at my right hand </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”? </t>
Hebrews 1-14 <pb/>Are they not all ministering spirits <f>ⓨ</f>sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to <f>ⓩ</f>inherit salvation?
