1 Kings 5-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> Now <f>ⓐ</f>Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, <f>ⓑ</f>for Hiram always loved David.
1 Kings 5-2 And Solomon sent word to Hiram,
1 Kings 5-3 <f>ⓒ</f> “You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God <f>ⓓ</f>because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
1 Kings 5-4 <f>ⓔ</f> But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune.
1 Kings 5-5 And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, <f>ⓕ</f>as the LORD said to David my father, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.’
1 Kings 5-6 Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”
1 Kings 5-7 <pb/>As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.”
1 Kings 5-8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.
1 Kings 5-9 My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes <f>ⓖ</f>by providing food for my household.”
1 Kings 5-10 So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired,
1 Kings 5-11 while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors <f>[2]</f> of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 <f>[3]</f> cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.
1 Kings 5-12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, <f>ⓗ</f>as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.
1 Kings 5-13 <pb/>King Solomon drafted <f>ⓘ</f>forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men.
1 Kings 5-14 And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. <f>ⓙ</f>Adoniram was in charge of the draft.
1 Kings 5-15 Solomon also <f>ⓚ</f>had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country,
1 Kings 5-16 besides Solomon's 3,300 <f>ⓛ</f>chief officers who were over the work, <f>ⓜ</f>who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
1 Kings 5-17 At the king's command <f>ⓝ</f>they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones.
1 Kings 5-18 So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and <f>ⓞ</f>the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.
