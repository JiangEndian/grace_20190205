Numbers 21-1 <pb/>When <f>ⓐ</f>the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in <f>ⓑ</f>the Negeb, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
Numbers 21-2 <f>ⓒ</f> And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD and said, “If you will indeed give this people into my hand, then I will devote their cities to destruction.” <f>[1]</f>
Numbers 21-3 And the LORD heeded the voice of Israel and gave over the Canaanites, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. So the name of the place was called <f>ⓓ</f>Hormah. <f>[2]</f>
Numbers 21-4 <pb/>From Mount Hor <f>ⓔ</f>they set out by the way to the Red Sea, <f>ⓕ</f>to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way.
Numbers 21-5 And the people <f>ⓖ</f>spoke against God and against Moses, <f>ⓗ</f>“Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and <f>ⓘ</f>we loathe this worthless food.”
Numbers 21-6 <f>ⓙ</f> Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and <f>ⓚ</f>they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.
Numbers 21-7 <f>ⓛ</f> And the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. <f>ⓜ</f>Pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.
Numbers 21-8 And the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.”
Numbers 21-9 So <f>ⓝ</f>Moses made a bronze <f>[3]</f> serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.
Numbers 21-10 <pb/>And the people of Israel set out and <f>ⓞ</f>camped in Oboth.
Numbers 21-11 <f>ⓟ</f> And they set out from Oboth and <f>ⓠ</f>camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise.
Numbers 21-12 From there they set out and camped in <f>ⓡ</f>the Valley of Zered.
Numbers 21-13 From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the <f>ⓢ</f>Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
Numbers 21-14 Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, <pb/><t>“Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon,</t>
Numbers 21-15 <t>and the slope of the valleys </t><t>that extends to the seat of <f>ⓣ</f>Ar, </t><t>and leans to the border of Moab.” </t>
Numbers 21-16 <pb/>And from there they continued <f>ⓤ</f>to Beer; <f>[4]</f> that is the well of which the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people together, so that <f>ⓥ</f>I may give them water.”
Numbers 21-17 Then Israel sang this song: <pb/><t>“Spring up, O well! — Sing to it! — </t>
Numbers 21-18 <t>the well that the princes made, </t><t>that the nobles of the people dug, </t><t>with <f>ⓦ</f>the scepter and with their staffs.” </t> <pb/>And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah,
Numbers 21-19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
Numbers 21-20 and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah <f>ⓧ</f>that looks down on the desert. <f>[5]</f>
Numbers 21-21 <pb/>Then <f>ⓨ</f>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
Numbers 21-22 <f>ⓩ</f> “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard. We will not drink the water of a well. We will go by the King's Highway until we have passed through your territory.”
Numbers 21-23 <f>ⓐ</f> But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and <f>ⓑ</f>came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
Numbers 21-24 <f>ⓒ</f> And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the <f>ⓓ</f>Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong.
Numbers 21-25 And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
Numbers 21-26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.
Numbers 21-27 Therefore the <f>ⓔ</f>ballad singers say, <pb/><t>“Come to <f>ⓕ</f>Heshbon, let it be built; </t><t>let the city of Sihon be established.</t>
Numbers 21-28 <t>For <f>ⓖ</f>fire came out from <f>ⓗ</f>Heshbon, </t><t>flame from the city of Sihon. </t><t>It devoured <f>ⓘ</f>Ar of Moab, </t><t>and swallowed <f>[6]</f> the heights of the Arnon.</t>
Numbers 21-29 <t><f>ⓙ</f> Woe to you, O Moab! </t><t>You are undone, O people of <f>ⓚ</f>Chemosh! </t><t>He has made his sons fugitives, </t><t>and his daughters captives, </t><t>to an Amorite king, Sihon.</t>
Numbers 21-30 <t>So we overthrew them; </t><t>Heshbon, as far as <f>ⓛ</f>Dibon, perished; </t><t>and we laid waste as far as Nophah; </t><t>fire spread as far as <f>ⓜ</f>Medeba.” <f>[7]</f> </t>
Numbers 21-31 <pb/>Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers 21-32 And Moses sent to spy out <f>ⓝ</f>Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.
Numbers 21-33 Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle <f>ⓞ</f>at Edrei.
Numbers 21-34 <f>ⓟ</f> But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people, and his land. And <f>ⓠ</f>you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”
Numbers 21-35 So they defeated him and his sons and all his people, until he had no survivor left. And they possessed his land.
