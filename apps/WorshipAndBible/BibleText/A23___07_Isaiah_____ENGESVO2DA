Isaiah 7-1 <pb/>In the days of <f>ⓐ</f>Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, <f>ⓑ</f>Rezin the king of Syria and <f>ⓒ</f>Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it.
Isaiah 7-2 When the house of David was told, <f>ⓓ</f>“Syria is in league with <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>Ephraim,” the heart of Ahaz <f>[2]</f> and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
Isaiah 7-3 <pb/>And the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and <f>ⓕ</f>Shear-jashub <f>[3]</f> your son, at the end of <f>ⓖ</f>the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field.
Isaiah 7-4 And say to him, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Be careful, <f>ⓘ</f>be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two <f>ⓙ</f>smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and <f>ⓚ</f>the son of Remaliah.
Isaiah 7-5 Because Syria, with Ephraim and <f>ⓛ</f>the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying,
Isaiah 7-6 “Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it <f>[4]</f> for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,”
Isaiah 7-7 thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“‘It shall not stand, </t><t>and it shall not come to pass.</t>
Isaiah 7-8 <t>For the head of Syria is <f>ⓝ</f>Damascus, </t><t>and the head of Damascus is Rezin. </t><t>And within sixty-five years </t><t>Ephraim will be shattered from being a people.</t>
Isaiah 7-9 <t>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, </t><t>and the head of Samaria is <f>ⓞ</f>the son of Remaliah. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>If you <f>[5]</f> are not firm in faith, </t><t>you will not be firm at all.’” </t>
Isaiah 7-10 <pb/>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz:
Isaiah 7-11 “Ask <f>ⓠ</f>a sign of the LORD your <f>[6]</f> God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.”
Isaiah 7-12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.”
Isaiah 7-13 And he <f>[7]</f> said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you <f>ⓡ</f>weary my God also?
Isaiah 7-14 Therefore the <f>ⓢ</f>Lord himself will give you a sign. <f>ⓣ</f>Behold, the <f>ⓤ</f>virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name <f>ⓥ</f>Immanuel. <f>[8]</f>
Isaiah 7-15 He shall eat <f>ⓦ</f>curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.
Isaiah 7-16 <f>ⓧ</f> For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be <f>ⓨ</f>deserted.
Isaiah 7-17 <f>ⓩ</f> The LORD will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that <f>ⓐ</f>Ephraim departed from Judah — the king of Assyria!”
Isaiah 7-18 <pb/>In that day the LORD will <f>ⓑ</f>whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
Isaiah 7-19 And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and <f>ⓒ</f>in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures. <f>[9]</f>
Isaiah 7-20 <pb/>In that day <f>ⓓ</f>the Lord will <f>ⓔ</f>shave with a razor that is <f>ⓕ</f>hired beyond <f>ⓖ</f>the River <f>[10]</f> — with the king of Assyria — the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.
Isaiah 7-21 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
Isaiah 7-22 and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat <f>ⓘ</f>curds and honey.
Isaiah 7-23 <pb/>In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels <f>[11]</f> of silver, will become <f>ⓙ</f>briers and thorns.
Isaiah 7-24 <f>ⓚ</f> With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns.
Isaiah 7-25 <f>ⓛ</f> And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear <f>ⓜ</f>of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.
