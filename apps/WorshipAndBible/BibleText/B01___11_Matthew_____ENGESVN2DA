Matthew 11-1 <pb/>When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
Matthew 11-2 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when John heard <f>ⓑ</f>in prison about the deeds of <f>ⓒ</f>the Christ, he sent word by <f>ⓓ</f>his disciples
Matthew 11-3 and said to him, “Are you <f>ⓔ</f>the one who is to come, or shall we <f>ⓕ</f>look for another?”
Matthew 11-4 And Jesus answered them, <J>“Go and tell John what you hear and see:</J>
Matthew 11-5 <J><f>ⓖ</f> the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers <f>[1]</f> are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and <f>ⓗ</f>the poor have good news preached to them.</J>
Matthew 11-6 <J>And blessed is the one who <f>ⓘ</f>is not offended by me.”</J>
Matthew 11-7 <pb/>As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: <J>“What did you go out <f>ⓙ</f>into the wilderness to see? <f>ⓚ</f>A reed shaken by the wind?</J>
Matthew 11-8 <J>What then did you go out to see? A man <f>[2]</f> dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.</J>
Matthew 11-9 <J>What then did you go out to see? <f>ⓛ</f>A prophet? <f>[3]</f> Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</J>
Matthew 11-10 <J>This is he of whom it is written,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓜ</f>“‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,</J> </t><t><J>who will prepare your way before you.’</J> </t>
Matthew 11-11 <pb/><J>Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</J>
Matthew 11-12 <J><f>ⓝ</f> From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, <f>[4]</f> and the violent take it by force.</J>
Matthew 11-13 <J><f>ⓞ</f> For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John,</J>
Matthew 11-14 <J>and if you are willing to accept it, he is <f>ⓟ</f>Elijah who is to come.</J>
Matthew 11-15 <J><f>ⓠ</f> He who has ears to hear, <f>[5]</f> let him hear.</J>
Matthew 11-16 <pb/><J>“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,</J>
Matthew 11-17 <pb/><t><J>“‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;</J> </t><t><J>we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’</J> </t>
Matthew 11-18 <pb/><J>For John came <f>ⓡ</f>neither eating <f>ⓢ</f>nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’</J>
Matthew 11-19 <J>The Son of Man came <f>ⓣ</f>eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, <f>ⓤ</f>a friend of <f>ⓥ</f>tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.” <f>[6]</f></J>
Matthew 11-20 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
Matthew 11-21 <J><f>ⓧ</f> “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in <f>ⓨ</f>Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</J>
Matthew 11-22 <J><f>ⓩ</f> But I tell you, it will be more bearable on <f>ⓐ</f>the day of judgment for <f>ⓑ</f>Tyre and Sidon than for you.</J>
Matthew 11-23 <J>And you, <f>ⓒ</f>Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to <f>ⓓ</f>Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</J>
Matthew 11-24 <J><f>ⓔ</f> But I tell you that <f>ⓕ</f>it will be more tolerable on <f>ⓖ</f>the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.”</J>
Matthew 11-25 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> At that time Jesus declared, <J>“I thank you, Father, <f>ⓘ</f>Lord of heaven and earth, that <f>ⓙ</f>you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and <f>ⓚ</f>revealed them to little children;</J>
Matthew 11-26 <J>yes, Father, for such was your <f>ⓛ</f>gracious will. <f>[7]</f></J>
Matthew 11-27 <J><f>ⓜ</f> All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son <f>ⓝ</f>except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone <f>ⓞ</f>to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</J>
Matthew 11-28 <J><f>ⓟ</f> Come to <f>ⓠ</f>me, all who labor and are <f>ⓡ</f>heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</J>
Matthew 11-29 <J>Take my yoke upon you, and <f>ⓢ</f>learn from me, for I am <f>ⓣ</f>gentle and lowly in heart, and <f>ⓤ</f>you will find rest for your souls.</J>
Matthew 11-30 <J>For <f>ⓥ</f>my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”</J>
