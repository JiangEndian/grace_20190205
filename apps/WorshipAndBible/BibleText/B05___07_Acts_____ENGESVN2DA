Acts 7-3 and said to him, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.’
Acts 7-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And <f>ⓖ</f>after his father died, <f>ⓗ</f>God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living.
Acts 7-5 Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised <f>ⓘ</f>to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, <f>ⓙ</f>though he had no child.

Acts 7-12 <f>ⓐ</f> But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit.
Acts 7-13 And <f>ⓑ</f>on the second visit <f>ⓒ</f>Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and <f>ⓓ</f>Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.
Acts 7-14 And <f>ⓔ</f>Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, <f>ⓕ</f>seventy-five persons in all.
Acts 7-15 And <f>ⓖ</f>Jacob went down into Egypt, and <f>ⓗ</f>he died, he <f>ⓘ</f>and our fathers,
Acts 7-16 and <f>ⓙ</f>they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that <f>ⓚ</f>Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts 7-17 <pb/>“But <f>ⓛ</f>as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, <f>ⓜ</f>the people increased and multiplied in Egypt

Acts 7-22 And Moses <f>ⓢ</f>was instructed in <f>ⓣ</f>all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was <f>ⓤ</f>mighty in his words and deeds.
Acts 7-23 <pb/>“When he was forty years old, it came into his heart <f>ⓥ</f>to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
Acts 7-24 And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian.
Acts 7-25 He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand.
Acts 7-26 <f>ⓦ</f> And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other?’
Acts 7-27 But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, <f>ⓧ</f>‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
Acts 7-28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’

Acts 7-32 <f>ⓒ</f> ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.’ And Moses trembled and did not dare to look.
Acts 7-33 Then the Lord said to him, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
Acts 7-34 <f>ⓔ</f> I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and <f>ⓕ</f>have heard their groaning, and <f>ⓖ</f>I have come down to deliver them. <f>ⓗ</f>And now come, I will send you to Egypt.’
Acts 7-35 <pb/>“This Moses, whom they rejected, <f>ⓘ</f>saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ — this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer <f>ⓙ</f>by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
Acts 7-36 <f>ⓚ</f> This man led them out, performing <f>ⓛ</f>wonders and signs <f>ⓜ</f>in Egypt and <f>ⓝ</f>at the Red Sea and <f>ⓞ</f>in the wilderness for <f>ⓟ</f>forty years.

Acts 7-38 This is the one <f>ⓡ</f>who was in the congregation in the wilderness with <f>ⓢ</f>the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. <f>ⓣ</f>He received <f>ⓤ</f>living <f>ⓥ</f>oracles to give to us.
Acts 7-39 Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and <f>ⓦ</f>in their hearts they turned to Egypt,

Acts 7-41 And <f>ⓨ</f>they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and <f>ⓩ</f>were rejoicing in <f>ⓐ</f>the works of their hands.
Acts 7-42 But <f>ⓑ</f>God turned away and <f>ⓒ</f>gave them over to worship <f>ⓓ</f>the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f>“‘Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</t>
Acts 7-43 <t>You took up the tent of <f>ⓖ</f>Moloch </t><t>and the star of your god Rephan, </t><t>the images that you made to worship; </t><t>and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.’ </t>
Acts 7-44 <pb/>“Our fathers had <f>ⓗ</f>the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses <f>ⓘ</f>directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen.
Acts 7-45 Our fathers in turn <f>ⓙ</f>brought it in with Joshua when they <f>ⓚ</f>dispossessed the nations <f>ⓛ</f>that God drove out before our fathers. So it was <f>ⓜ</f>until the days of David,

Acts 7-47 But it was <f>ⓠ</f>Solomon who built a house for him.
Acts 7-48 <f>ⓡ</f> Yet the Most High does not dwell <f>ⓢ</f>in houses made by hands, as the prophet says,
Acts 7-49 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> “‘Heaven is my throne, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>and the earth is my footstool. </t><t>What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, </t><t>or what is the place of my rest?</t>
Acts 7-50 <t>Did not my hand make all these things?’ </t>
Acts 7-51 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> “You stiff-necked people, <f>ⓦ</f>uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. <f>ⓧ</f>As your fathers did, so do you.
Acts 7-52 <f>ⓨ</f> Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of <f>ⓩ</f>the Righteous One, <f>ⓐ</f>whom you have now betrayed and murdered,
Acts 7-53 you who received the law <f>ⓑ</f>as delivered by angels and <f>ⓒ</f>did not keep it.”
Acts 7-54 <pb/>Now when they heard these things <f>ⓓ</f>they were enraged, and they <f>ⓔ</f>ground their teeth at him.

Acts 7-58 Then <f>ⓛ</f>they cast him out of the city and <f>ⓜ</f>stoned him. And <f>ⓝ</f>the witnesses laid down their garments <f>ⓞ</f>at the feet of a young man named Saul.
Acts 7-59 And as they were stoning Stephen, <f>ⓟ</f>he called out, “Lord Jesus, <f>ⓠ</f>receive my spirit.”
Acts 7-60 And <f>ⓡ</f>falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, <f>ⓢ</f>“Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And when he had said this, <f>ⓣ</f>he fell asleep.
