Malachi 1-1 <pb/>The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi. <f>[1]</f>
Malachi 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “I have loved you,” says the LORD. <f>ⓑ</f>But you say, “How have you loved us?” “Is not Esau <f>ⓒ</f>Jacob's brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet <f>ⓓ</f>I have loved Jacob
Malachi 1-3 but Esau I have hated. <f>ⓔ</f>I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.”
Malachi 1-4 If Edom says, “We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,” the LORD of hosts says, “They may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called ‘the wicked country,’ and ‘the people with whom the LORD is angry forever.’”
Malachi 1-5 <f>ⓕ</f> Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, “Great is the LORD beyond the border of Israel!”
Malachi 1-6 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> “A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am <f>ⓗ</f>a father, where is my honor? And if I am <f>ⓘ</f>a master, where is my fear? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. <f>ⓙ</f>But you say, ‘How have we despised your name?’
Malachi 1-7 <f>ⓚ</f> By offering polluted food upon my altar. <f>ⓛ</f>But you say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ By saying that <f>ⓜ</f>the LORD's table may be despised.
Malachi 1-8 <f>ⓝ</f> When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 1-9 And now <f>ⓞ</f>entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, <f>ⓟ</f>will he show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 1-10 <f>ⓠ</f> Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓡ</f>and I will not accept an offering from your hand.
Malachi 1-11 For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name <f>ⓢ</f>will be <f>[2]</f> great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name <f>ⓣ</f>will be great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts.
Malachi 1-12 But you profane it when you say that <f>ⓤ</f>the Lord's table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised.
Malachi 1-13 But you say, <f>ⓥ</f>‘What a weariness this is,’ and you snort at it, says the LORD of hosts. <f>ⓦ</f>You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the LORD.
Malachi 1-14 Cursed be the cheat who has <f>ⓧ</f>a male in his flock, and <f>ⓨ</f>vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For <f>ⓩ</f>I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name <f>ⓐ</f>will be feared among the nations.
