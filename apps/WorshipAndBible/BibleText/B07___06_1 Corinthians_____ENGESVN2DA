1 Corinthians 6-1 <pb/>When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous <f>ⓐ</f>instead of the saints?
1 Corinthians 6-2 Or do you not know that <f>ⓑ</f>the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?
1 Corinthians 6-3 Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life!
1 Corinthians 6-4 So if you have such cases, <f>ⓒ</f>why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church?
1 Corinthians 6-5 <f>ⓓ</f> I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers,
1 Corinthians 6-6 but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?
1 Corinthians 6-7 To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. <f>ⓔ</f>Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?
1 Corinthians 6-8 But you yourselves wrong and defraud — even <f>ⓕ</f>your own brothers! <f>[1]</f>
1 Corinthians 6-9 <pb/>Or do you not know that the unrighteous <f>[2]</f> will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: <f>ⓖ</f>neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, <f>[3]</f>
1 Corinthians 6-10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
1 Corinthians 6-11 And <f>ⓗ</f>such were some of you. But <f>ⓘ</f>you were washed, <f>ⓙ</f>you were sanctified, <f>ⓚ</f>you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
1 Corinthians 6-12 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything.
1 Corinthians 6-13 <f>ⓜ</f> “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food” — and God will destroy both one <f>ⓝ</f>and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but <f>ⓞ</f>for the Lord, and <f>ⓟ</f>the Lord for the body.
1 Corinthians 6-14 And <f>ⓠ</f>God raised the Lord and <f>ⓡ</f>will also raise us up <f>ⓢ</f>by his power.
1 Corinthians 6-15 Do you not know that <f>ⓣ</f>your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!
1 Corinthians 6-16 Or do you not know that he who is joined <f>[4]</f> to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, <f>ⓤ</f>“The two will become one flesh.”
1 Corinthians 6-17 But he who is joined to the Lord <f>ⓥ</f>becomes one spirit with him.
1 Corinthians 6-18 <f>ⓦ</f> Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin <f>[5]</f> a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person <f>ⓧ</f>sins against his own body.
1 Corinthians 6-19 Or <f>ⓨ</f>do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? <f>ⓩ</f>You are not your own,
1 Corinthians 6-20 <f>ⓐ</f> for you were bought with a price. <f>ⓑ</f>So glorify God in your body.
