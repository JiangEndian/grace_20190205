Jonah 4-1 <pb/>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓐ</f>he was angry.
Jonah 4-2 And he prayed to the LORD and said, “O LORD, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? <f>ⓑ</f>That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a <f>ⓒ</f>gracious God and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and <f>ⓓ</f>relenting from disaster.
Jonah 4-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, <f>ⓕ</f>for it is better for me to die than to live.”
Jonah 4-4 And the LORD said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Do you do well to be angry?”
Jonah 4-5 <pb/>Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and <f>ⓗ</f>made a booth for himself there. He sat under it in the shade, till he should see what would become of the city.
Jonah 4-6 Now the LORD God appointed a plant <f>[2]</f> and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. <f>[3]</f> So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant.
Jonah 4-7 But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered.
Jonah 4-8 When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching <f>ⓘ</f>east wind, <f>ⓙ</f>and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah so that he <f>ⓚ</f>was faint. And he asked that he might die and said, <f>ⓛ</f>“It is better for me to die than to live.”
Jonah 4-9 But God said to Jonah, <f>ⓜ</f>“Do you do well to be angry for the plant?” And he said, “Yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.”
Jonah 4-10 And the LORD said, “You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow, which came into being in a night and perished in a night.
Jonah 4-11 And should not I pity <f>ⓝ</f>Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know their right hand from their left, and also much <f>ⓞ</f>cattle?”
