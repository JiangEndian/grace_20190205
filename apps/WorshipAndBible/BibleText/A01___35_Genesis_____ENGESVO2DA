Genesis 35-1 <pb/>God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to <f>ⓐ</f>Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you <f>ⓑ</f>when you fled from your brother Esau.”
Genesis 35-2 So Jacob said to his <f>ⓒ</f>household and to all who were with him, “Put away <f>ⓓ</f>the foreign gods that are among you and <f>ⓔ</f>purify yourselves and change your garments.
Genesis 35-3 Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God <f>ⓕ</f>who answers me in the day of my distress and <f>ⓖ</f>has been with me wherever I have gone.”
Genesis 35-4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under <f>ⓗ</f>the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.
Genesis 35-5 <pb/>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
Genesis 35-6 And Jacob came to <f>ⓘ</f>Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,
Genesis 35-7 and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, <f>[1]</f> because <f>ⓙ</f>there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
Genesis 35-8 And <f>ⓚ</f>Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth. <f>[2]</f>
Genesis 35-9 <pb/>God appeared <f>[3]</f> to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
Genesis 35-10 And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; <f>ⓛ</f>no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but <f>ⓜ</f>Israel shall be your name.” So he called his name Israel.
Genesis 35-11 And God said to him, <f>ⓝ</f>“I am God Almighty: <f>[4]</f> be <f>ⓞ</f>fruitful and multiply. <f>ⓟ</f>A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body. <f>[5]</f>
Genesis 35-12 <f>ⓠ</f> The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.”
Genesis 35-13 Then God <f>ⓡ</f>went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.
Genesis 35-14 And Jacob <f>ⓢ</f>set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.
Genesis 35-15 So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him <f>ⓣ</f>Bethel.
Genesis 35-16 <pb/>Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance <f>[6]</f> from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor.
Genesis 35-17 And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for <f>ⓤ</f>you have another son.”
Genesis 35-18 And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>but his father called him Benjamin. <f>[8]</f>
Genesis 35-19 So <f>ⓦ</f>Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to <f>ⓧ</f>Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),
Genesis 35-20 and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is <f>ⓨ</f>the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.
Genesis 35-21 Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis 35-22 <pb/>While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and <f>ⓩ</f>lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard of it. <pb/>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
Genesis 35-23 The sons of Leah: <f>ⓐ</f>Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
Genesis 35-24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis 35-25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali.
Genesis 35-26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
Genesis 35-27 <pb/>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at <f>ⓑ</f>Mamre, or <f>ⓒ</f>Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
Genesis 35-28 Now the days of Isaac were 180 years.
Genesis 35-29 And Isaac breathed his last, and he died <f>ⓓ</f>and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And <f>ⓔ</f>his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
