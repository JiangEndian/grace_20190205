Ezekiel 28-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 28-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, say to <f>ⓑ</f>the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Because your heart is proud, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>you have said, ‘I am a god, </t><t>I sit in the seat of the gods, </t><t>in the heart of the seas,’ </t><t>yet <f>ⓔ</f>you are but a man, and no god, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>though you make your heart like the heart of a god — </t>
Ezekiel 28-3 <t><f>ⓖ</f> you are indeed wiser <f>ⓗ</f>than <f>ⓘ</f>Daniel; </t><t>no secret is hidden from you;</t>
Ezekiel 28-4 <t>by your wisdom and your understanding </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>you have made wealth for yourself, </t><t>and have gathered gold and silver </t><t>into your treasuries;</t>
Ezekiel 28-5 <t>by your great wisdom in your trade </t><t>you have increased your wealth, </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>your heart has become proud in your wealth — </t>
Ezekiel 28-6 <t>therefore thus says the Lord GOD: </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>Because you make your heart </t><t>like the heart of a god,</t>
Ezekiel 28-7 <t>therefore, behold, I will bring <f>ⓜ</f>foreigners upon you, </t><t>the most ruthless of the nations; </t><t>and they shall draw their swords against <f>ⓝ</f>the beauty of your wisdom </t><t>and defile <f>ⓞ</f>your splendor.</t>
Ezekiel 28-8 <t><f>ⓟ</f> They shall thrust you down into the pit, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and you shall die the death of the slain </t><t>in the heart of the seas.</t>
Ezekiel 28-9 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’ </t><t>in the presence of those who kill you, </t><t>though <f>ⓢ</f>you are but a man, and no god, </t><t>in the hands of those who slay you?</t>
Ezekiel 28-10 <t><f>ⓣ</f> You shall die the death of the uncircumcised </t><t>by the hand of foreigners; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.” </t>
Ezekiel 28-11 <pb/>Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 28-12 <f>ⓥ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓦ</f>raise a lamentation over <f>ⓧ</f>the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t>“You were the signet of perfection, <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>full of wisdom and <f>ⓩ</f>perfect in beauty.</t>
Ezekiel 28-13 <t>You were in <f>ⓐ</f>Eden, the garden of God; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>every precious stone was your covering, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>sardius, topaz, and diamond, </t><t>beryl, onyx, and jasper, </t><t>sapphire, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>emerald, and carbuncle; </t><t>and crafted in gold were your settings </t><t>and your engravings. <f>[3]</f> </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>On the day that you were created </t><t>they were prepared.</t>
Ezekiel 28-14 <t>You were an anointed <f>ⓕ</f>guardian cherub. </t><t>I placed you; <f>[4]</f> you were on <f>ⓖ</f>the holy mountain of God; </t><t>in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.</t>
Ezekiel 28-15 <t>You were blameless in your ways </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>from the day you were created, </t><t>till unrighteousness was found in you.</t>
Ezekiel 28-16 <t>In the abundance of <f>ⓘ</f>your trade </t><t>you were filled with violence in your midst, and you sinned; </t><t>so I cast you as a profane thing from <f>ⓙ</f>the mountain of God, </t><t>and I destroyed you, <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>O guardian cherub, </t><t>from the midst of the stones of fire.</t>
Ezekiel 28-17 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Your heart was proud because of <f>ⓜ</f>your beauty; </t><t>you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. </t><t>I cast you to the ground; </t><t>I exposed you before kings, </t><t>to feast their eyes on you.</t>
Ezekiel 28-18 <t>By the multitude of your iniquities, </t><t>in the unrighteousness of your trade </t><t>you profaned your sanctuaries; </t><t>so <f>ⓝ</f>I brought fire out from your midst; </t><t>it consumed you, </t><t>and I turned you to ashes on the earth </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>in the sight of all who saw you.</t>
Ezekiel 28-19 <t>All who know you among the peoples </t><t>are appalled at you; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>you have come to a dreadful end </t><t>and shall be no more forever.” </t>
Ezekiel 28-20 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 28-21 <f>ⓠ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓡ</f>set your face toward <f>ⓢ</f>Sidon, and <f>ⓣ</f>prophesy against her
Ezekiel 28-22 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t>“Behold, <f>ⓤ</f>I am against you, O Sidon, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>I will manifest my glory in your midst. </t><t>And <f>ⓦ</f>they shall know that I am the LORD </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>when I execute judgments in her </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>manifest my holiness in her;</t>
Ezekiel 28-23 <t>for I will send <f>ⓩ</f>pestilence into her, </t><t>and blood into her streets; </t><t>and the slain shall fall in her midst, </t><t>by the sword that is against her on every side. </t><t>Then they will know that I am the LORD. </t>
Ezekiel 28-24 <pb/>“And for the house of Israel <f>ⓐ</f>there shall be no more a brier to prick or <f>ⓑ</f>a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors <f>ⓒ</f>who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 28-25 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓓ</f>When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and <f>ⓔ</f>manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations, <f>ⓕ</f>then they shall dwell in their own land that I gave to my servant Jacob.
Ezekiel 28-26 <f>ⓖ</f> And they shall dwell securely in it, and they shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall dwell securely, <f>ⓗ</f>when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors <f>ⓘ</f>who have treated them with contempt. <f>ⓙ</f>Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.”
