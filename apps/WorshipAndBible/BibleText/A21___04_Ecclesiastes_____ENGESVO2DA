Ecclesiastes 4-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Again I <f>ⓑ</f>saw all <f>ⓒ</f>the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had <f>ⓓ</f>no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.
Ecclesiastes 4-2 And I <f>ⓔ</f>thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.
Ecclesiastes 4-3 But <f>ⓕ</f>better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 4-4 <pb/>Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor. This also is <f>ⓖ</f>vanity <f>[1]</f> and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes 4-5 <pb/>The fool <f>ⓗ</f>folds his hands and <f>ⓘ</f>eats his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes 4-6 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Better is a handful of <f>ⓚ</f>quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes 4-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Again, I saw vanity under the sun:
Ecclesiastes 4-8 one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his <f>ⓜ</f>eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, <f>ⓝ</f>“For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity and an unhappy <f>ⓞ</f>business.
Ecclesiastes 4-9 <pb/>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.
Ecclesiastes 4-10 For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!
Ecclesiastes 4-11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, <f>ⓟ</f>but how can one keep warm alone?
Ecclesiastes 4-12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him — a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Ecclesiastes 4-13 <pb/>Better was <f>ⓠ</f>a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how <f>ⓡ</f>to take advice.
Ecclesiastes 4-14 For he went <f>ⓢ</f>from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.
Ecclesiastes 4-15 I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that <f>[2]</f> youth who was to stand in the king's <f>[3]</f> place.
Ecclesiastes 4-16 There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is <f>ⓣ</f>vanity and a striving after wind.
