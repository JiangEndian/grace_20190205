Haggai 1-2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD.”
Haggai 1-3 Then the word of the LORD came <f>ⓕ</f>by the hand of Haggai the prophet,
Haggai 1-4 <f>ⓖ</f> “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while <f>ⓗ</f>this house lies in ruins?
Haggai 1-5 Now, therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓘ</f>Consider your ways.
Haggai 1-6 <f>ⓙ</f> You have sown much, and harvested little. <f>ⓚ</f>You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who <f>ⓛ</f>earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.
Haggai 1-7 <pb/>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓜ</f>Consider your ways.
Haggai 1-8 Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that <f>ⓝ</f>I may take pleasure in it and that <f>ⓞ</f>I may be glorified, says the LORD.
Haggai 1-9 <f>ⓟ</f> You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, <f>ⓠ</f>I blew it away. Why? declares the LORD of hosts. Because of my house <f>ⓡ</f>that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house.
Haggai 1-10 Therefore <f>ⓢ</f>the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.
Haggai 1-11 And <f>ⓣ</f>I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on <f>ⓤ</f>the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and <f>ⓥ</f>on all their labors.”

Haggai 1-14 And <f>ⓑ</f>the LORD stirred up the spirit of <f>ⓒ</f>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of <f>ⓓ</f>Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all <f>ⓔ</f>the remnant of the people.
