Ezekiel 11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to <f>ⓑ</f>the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. And behold, at the entrance of the gateway there were <f>ⓒ</f>twenty-five men. And I saw among them Jaazaniah <f>ⓓ</f>the son of Azzur, and <f>ⓔ</f>Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
Ezekiel 11-2 And he said to me, <f>ⓕ</f>“Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city;
Ezekiel 11-3 <f>ⓖ</f> who say, <f>ⓗ</f>‘The time is not near <f>[1]</f> to build houses. <f>ⓘ</f>This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’
Ezekiel 11-4 Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man.”
Ezekiel 11-5 <pb/>And <f>ⓙ</f>the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, “Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel. <f>ⓚ</f>For I know the things that come into your mind.
Ezekiel 11-6 <f>ⓛ</f> You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain.
Ezekiel 11-7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓜ</f>Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, <f>ⓝ</f>they are the meat, and <f>ⓞ</f>this city is the cauldron, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it.
Ezekiel 11-8 <f>ⓟ</f> You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 11-9 And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and <f>ⓠ</f>give you into the hands of foreigners, and <f>ⓡ</f>execute judgments upon you.
Ezekiel 11-10 <f>ⓢ</f> You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, <f>ⓣ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 11-11 <f>ⓤ</f> This city shall not be your cauldron, nor shall you be the meat in the midst of it. I will judge you at the border of Israel,
Ezekiel 11-12 and you shall know that I am the LORD. For you have not walked in my statutes, nor obeyed my rules, <f>ⓥ</f>but have acted according to the rules of the nations that are around you.”
Ezekiel 11-13 <pb/>And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, <f>ⓦ</f>that <f>ⓧ</f>Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. <f>ⓨ</f>Then I fell down on my face and cried out with a loud voice and said, <f>ⓩ</f>“Ah, Lord GOD! <f>ⓐ</f>Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?”
Ezekiel 11-14 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 11-15 <f>ⓑ</f> “Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, your kinsmen, <f>[2]</f> the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, <f>ⓒ</f>‘Go far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession.’
Ezekiel 11-16 Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet <f>ⓓ</f>I have been a sanctuary to them for a while <f>[3]</f> in the countries where they have gone.’
Ezekiel 11-17 Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓔ</f>I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, <f>ⓕ</f>and I will give you the land of Israel.’
Ezekiel 11-18 And when they come there, <f>ⓖ</f>they will remove from it all its <f>ⓗ</f>detestable things and all its abominations.
Ezekiel 11-19 <f>ⓘ</f> And I will give them one heart, and <f>ⓙ</f>a new spirit I will put within them. <f>ⓚ</f>I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh <f>ⓛ</f>and give them a heart of flesh,
Ezekiel 11-20 <f>ⓜ</f> that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them. <f>ⓝ</f>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel 11-21 <f>ⓞ</f> But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, <f>ⓟ</f>I will <f>[4]</f> bring their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD.”
Ezekiel 11-22 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, <f>ⓡ</f>and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
Ezekiel 11-23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and <f>ⓢ</f>stood on the mountain that is on the east side of the city.
Ezekiel 11-24 <f>ⓣ</f> And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me <f>ⓤ</f>in the vision by the Spirit of God <f>ⓥ</f>into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me.
Ezekiel 11-25 And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had shown me.
