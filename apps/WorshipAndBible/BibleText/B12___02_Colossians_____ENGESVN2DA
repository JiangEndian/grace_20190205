Colossians 2-1 <pb/>For I want you to know <f>ⓐ</f>how great a <f>ⓑ</f>struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face,
Colossians 2-2 that <f>ⓒ</f>their hearts may be encouraged, being <f>ⓓ</f>knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of <f>ⓔ</f>God's mystery, which is Christ,
Colossians 2-3 <f>ⓕ</f> in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians 2-4 I say this in order <f>ⓖ</f>that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.
Colossians 2-5 For <f>ⓗ</f>though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your <f>ⓘ</f>good order and <f>ⓙ</f>the firmness of your faith in Christ.
Colossians 2-6 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,
Colossians 2-7 <f>ⓛ</f> rooted and <f>ⓜ</f>built up in him and <f>ⓝ</f>established in the faith, just <f>ⓞ</f>as you were taught, abounding <f>ⓟ</f>in thanksgiving.
Colossians 2-8 <pb/>See to it that no one takes you captive by <f>ⓠ</f>philosophy and <f>ⓡ</f>empty deceit, according to <f>ⓢ</f>human tradition, according to the <f>ⓣ</f>elemental spirits <f>[1]</f> of the world, and not according to Christ.
Colossians 2-9 For <f>ⓤ</f>in him the whole fullness of deity dwells <f>ⓥ</f>bodily,
Colossians 2-10 and <f>ⓦ</f>you have been filled in him, who is <f>ⓧ</f>the head of all rule and authority.
Colossians 2-11 In him also <f>ⓨ</f>you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by <f>ⓩ</f>putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
Colossians 2-12 <f>ⓐ</f> having been buried with him in baptism, in which <f>ⓑ</f>you were also raised with him through faith in <f>ⓒ</f>the powerful working of God, <f>ⓓ</f>who raised him from the dead.
Colossians 2-13 <f>ⓔ</f> And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God <f>ⓕ</f>made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,
Colossians 2-14 by <f>ⓖ</f>canceling <f>ⓗ</f>the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.
Colossians 2-15 <f>ⓘ</f> He disarmed the rulers and authorities <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓙ</f>put them to open shame, by <f>ⓚ</f>triumphing over them in him. <f>[3]</f>
Colossians 2-16 <pb/>Therefore let no one <f>ⓛ</f>pass judgment on you <f>ⓜ</f>in questions of food and drink, or with regard to <f>ⓝ</f>a festival or <f>ⓞ</f>a new moon or a Sabbath.
Colossians 2-17 <f>ⓟ</f> These are a shadow of the things to come, but <f>ⓠ</f>the substance belongs to Christ.
Colossians 2-18 Let no one <f>ⓡ</f>disqualify you, <f>ⓢ</f>insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, <f>ⓣ</f>going on in detail about visions, <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>puffed up without reason by <f>ⓥ</f>his sensuous mind,
Colossians 2-19 and <f>ⓦ</f>not <f>ⓧ</f>holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.
Colossians 2-20 <pb/>If with Christ <f>ⓨ</f>you died to the <f>ⓩ</f>elemental spirits of the world, <f>ⓐ</f>why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations —
Colossians 2-21 <f>ⓑ</f> “Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch”
Colossians 2-22 (<f>ⓒ</f>referring to things that all perish as they are used) — according to <f>ⓓ</f>human precepts and teachings?
Colossians 2-23 These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in <f>ⓔ</f>promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are <f>ⓕ</f>of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
