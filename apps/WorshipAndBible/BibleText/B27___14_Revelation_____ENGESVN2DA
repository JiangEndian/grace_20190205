Revelation 14-1 <pb/>Then I looked, and behold, on <f>ⓐ</f>Mount Zion <f>ⓑ</f>stood the Lamb, and with him <f>ⓒ</f>144,000 who <f>ⓓ</f>had his name and his Father's name written <f>ⓔ</f>on their foreheads.
Revelation 14-2 And I heard a voice from heaven <f>ⓕ</f>like the roar of many waters and <f>ⓖ</f>like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of <f>ⓗ</f>harpists playing on their harps,
Revelation 14-3 and they were singing <f>ⓘ</f>a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. <f>ⓙ</f>No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
Revelation 14-4 It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for <f>ⓚ</f>they are virgins. It is these <f>ⓛ</f>who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as <f>ⓜ</f>firstfruits for God and the Lamb,
Revelation 14-5 and <f>ⓝ</f>in their mouth no lie was found, for they are <f>ⓞ</f>blameless.
Revelation 14-6 <pb/>Then I saw another angel <f>ⓟ</f>flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to <f>ⓠ</f>those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.
Revelation 14-7 And he said with a loud voice, <f>ⓡ</f>“Fear God and <f>ⓢ</f>give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and <f>ⓣ</f>worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the <f>ⓤ</f>springs of water.”
Revelation 14-8 <pb/>Another angel, a second, followed, saying, <f>ⓥ</f>“Fallen, fallen is <f>ⓦ</f>Babylon the great, <f>ⓧ</f>she who made all nations drink <f>ⓨ</f>the wine of the passion <f>[1]</f> of her sexual immorality.”
Revelation 14-9 <pb/>And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone <f>ⓩ</f>worships the beast and its image and receives <f>ⓐ</f>a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
Revelation 14-10 he also will drink <f>ⓑ</f>the wine of God's wrath, <f>ⓒ</f>poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and <f>ⓓ</f>he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
Revelation 14-11 And <f>ⓔ</f>the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and <f>ⓕ</f>they have no rest, day or night, these <f>ⓖ</f>worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.”
Revelation 14-12 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who <f>ⓘ</f>keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus. <f>[2]</f>
Revelation 14-13 <pb/>And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: <f>ⓙ</f>Blessed are the dead <f>ⓚ</f>who die in the Lord from now on.” “Blessed indeed,” says the Spirit, <f>ⓛ</f>“that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!”
Revelation 14-14 <pb/>Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one <f>ⓜ</f>like a son of man, <f>ⓝ</f>with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.
Revelation 14-15 And another angel <f>ⓞ</f>came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, <f>ⓟ</f>“Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for <f>ⓠ</f>the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”
Revelation 14-16 So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was reaped.
Revelation 14-17 <pb/>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
Revelation 14-18 And another angel came out from the altar, <f>ⓡ</f>the angel who has authority over the fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, “Put in your sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, <f>ⓢ</f>for its grapes are ripe.”
Revelation 14-19 So the angel swung his sickle across the earth and gathered the grape harvest of the earth and threw it into the great <f>ⓣ</f>winepress of the wrath of God.
Revelation 14-20 And <f>ⓤ</f>the winepress was trodden <f>ⓥ</f>outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress, as high as <f>ⓦ</f>a horse's bridle, for 1,600 stadia. <f>[3]</f>
