1 Thessalonians 2-1 <pb/>For you yourselves know, brothers, <f>[1]</f> that our <f>ⓐ</f>coming to you <f>ⓑ</f>was not in vain.
1 Thessalonians 2-2 But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated <f>ⓒ</f>at Philippi, as you know, <f>ⓓ</f>we had boldness in our God <f>ⓔ</f>to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much <f>ⓕ</f>conflict.
1 Thessalonians 2-3 For <f>ⓖ</f>our appeal does not spring from <f>ⓗ</f>error or <f>ⓘ</f>impurity or <f>ⓙ</f>any attempt to deceive,
1 Thessalonians 2-4 but just as we have been approved by God <f>ⓚ</f>to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not <f>ⓛ</f>to please man, but to please God <f>ⓜ</f>who tests our hearts.
1 Thessalonians 2-5 <f>ⓝ</f> For we never came with words of flattery, <f>[2]</f> as you know, nor with a pretext for greed — <f>ⓞ</f>God is witness.
1 Thessalonians 2-6 <f>ⓟ</f> Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, <f>ⓠ</f>though we could have made <f>ⓡ</f>demands as <f>ⓢ</f>apostles of Christ.
1 Thessalonians 2-7 But we were <f>ⓣ</f>gentle <f>[3]</f> among you, <f>ⓤ</f>like a nursing mother taking care of her own children.
1 Thessalonians 2-8 So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God <f>ⓥ</f>but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.
1 Thessalonians 2-9 <pb/>For you remember, brothers, <f>ⓦ</f>our labor and toil: we <f>ⓧ</f>worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.
1 Thessalonians 2-10 You are witnesses, and <f>ⓨ</f>God also, <f>ⓩ</f>how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers.
1 Thessalonians 2-11 For you know how, <f>ⓐ</f>like a father with his children,
1 Thessalonians 2-12 we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and <f>ⓑ</f>charged <f>ⓒ</f>you to walk in a manner worthy of God, <f>ⓓ</f>who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
1 Thessalonians 2-13 <pb/>And <f>ⓔ</f>we also thank God constantly <f>[4]</f> for this, that when you received <f>ⓕ</f>the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it <f>ⓖ</f>not as the word of men <f>[5]</f> but as what it really is, the word of God, <f>ⓗ</f>which is at work in you believers.
1 Thessalonians 2-14 For you, brothers, <f>ⓘ</f>became imitators of <f>ⓙ</f>the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For <f>ⓚ</f>you suffered the same things from your own countrymen <f>ⓛ</f>as they did from the Jews, <f>[6]</f>
1 Thessalonians 2-15 <f>ⓜ</f> who killed both the Lord Jesus and <f>ⓝ</f>the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and <f>ⓞ</f>oppose all mankind
1 Thessalonians 2-16 <f>ⓟ</f> by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved — so as always <f>ⓠ</f>to fill up the measure of their sins. But <f>ⓡ</f>wrath has come upon them at last! <f>[7]</f>
1 Thessalonians 2-17 <pb/>But since we were torn away from you, brothers, for a short time, <f>ⓢ</f>in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire <f>ⓣ</f>to see you face to face,
1 Thessalonians 2-18 because we wanted to come to you — I, Paul, again and again — but Satan <f>ⓤ</f>hindered us.
1 Thessalonians 2-19 For what is our hope or <f>ⓥ</f>joy or crown of boasting <f>ⓦ</f>before our Lord Jesus at his <f>ⓧ</f>coming? Is it not you?
1 Thessalonians 2-20 For you are our glory and joy.
