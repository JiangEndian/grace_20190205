Matthew 8-1 <pb/>When he came down from the mountain, <f>ⓐ</f>great crowds followed him.
Matthew 8-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And behold, a leper <f>[1]</f> came to him and <f>ⓒ</f>knelt before him, saying, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.”
Matthew 8-3 And Jesus <f>[2]</f> stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <J>“I will; be clean.”</J> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Matthew 8-4 And Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, <f>ⓔ</f>show yourself to the priest and <f>ⓕ</f>offer the gift that Moses commanded, <f>ⓖ</f>for a proof to them.”</J>
Matthew 8-5 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him,
Matthew 8-6 “Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly.”
Matthew 8-7 And he said to him, <J>“I will come and heal him.”</J>
Matthew 8-8 But the centurion replied, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but <f>ⓘ</f>only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
Matthew 8-9 For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant, <f>[3]</f> ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
Matthew 8-10 When Jesus heard this, <f>ⓙ</f>he marveled and said to those who followed him, <J>“Truly, I tell you, with <f>ⓚ</f>no one in Israel <f>[4]</f> have I found such faith.</J>
Matthew 8-11 <J>I tell you, <f>ⓛ</f>many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,</J>
Matthew 8-12 <J><f>ⓜ</f> while the sons of the kingdom <f>ⓝ</f>will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place <f>ⓞ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</J>
Matthew 8-13 And to the centurion Jesus said, <J>“Go; let it be done for you <f>ⓟ</f>as you have believed.”</J> <f>ⓠ</f>And the servant was healed at that very moment.
Matthew 8-14 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw <f>ⓢ</f>his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
Matthew 8-15 He <f>ⓣ</f>touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him.
Matthew 8-16 That evening they brought to him many who were <f>ⓤ</f>oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits <f>ⓥ</f>with a word and healed all who were sick.
Matthew 8-17 <f>ⓦ</f> This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: <f>ⓧ</f>“He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.”
Matthew 8-18 <pb/>Now <f>ⓨ</f>when Jesus saw a crowd around him, <f>ⓩ</f>he gave orders to go over to the other side.
Matthew 8-19 <f>ⓐ</f> And a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
Matthew 8-20 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</J>
Matthew 8-21 Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”
Matthew 8-22 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Follow me, and leave <f>ⓑ</f>the dead to bury their own dead.”</J>
Matthew 8-23 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
Matthew 8-24 And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but <f>ⓓ</f>he was asleep.
Matthew 8-25 And they went and woke him, saying, <f>ⓔ</f>“Save us, Lord; we are perishing.”
Matthew 8-26 And he said to them, <J>“Why are you <f>ⓕ</f>afraid, <f>ⓖ</f>O you of little faith?”</J> Then he rose and <f>ⓗ</f>rebuked the winds and the sea, and <f>ⓘ</f>there was a great calm.
Matthew 8-27 And the men <f>ⓙ</f>marveled, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even <f>ⓚ</f>winds and sea obey him?”
Matthew 8-28 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, <f>[5]</f> two <f>ⓜ</f>demon-possessed <f>[6]</f> men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way.
Matthew 8-29 And behold, they <f>ⓝ</f>cried out, “What have you to do with us, <f>ⓞ</f>O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us <f>ⓟ</f>before the time?”
Matthew 8-30 Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them.
Matthew 8-31 And the demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs.”
Matthew 8-32 And he said to them, <J>“Go.”</J> So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.
Matthew 8-33 The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the <f>ⓠ</f>demon-possessed men.
Matthew 8-34 And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, <f>ⓡ</f>they begged him to leave their region.
