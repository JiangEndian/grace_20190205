1 Timothy 6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Let all who are under a yoke as bondservants <f>[1]</f> regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, <f>ⓑ</f>so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled.
1 Timothy 6-2 Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are <f>ⓒ</f>brothers; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved. <pb/><e>False Teachers and True Contentment</e> </pb> <pb/><f>ⓓ</f>Teach and urge these things.
1 Timothy 6-3 If anyone <f>ⓔ</f>teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with <f>ⓕ</f>the sound <f>[2]</f> words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching <f>ⓖ</f>that accords with godliness,
1 Timothy 6-4 <f>ⓗ</f> he is puffed up with conceit and <f>ⓘ</f>understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for <f>ⓙ</f>controversy and for <f>ⓚ</f>quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions,
1 Timothy 6-5 and constant friction among people <f>ⓛ</f>who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, <f>ⓜ</f>imagining that godliness is a means of gain.
1 Timothy 6-6 But <f>ⓝ</f>godliness <f>ⓞ</f>with contentment is great gain,
1 Timothy 6-7 for <f>ⓟ</f>we brought nothing into the world, and <f>[3]</f> we cannot take anything out of the world.
1 Timothy 6-8 But <f>ⓠ</f>if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.
1 Timothy 6-9 But <f>ⓡ</f>those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, <f>ⓢ</f>into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that <f>ⓣ</f>plunge people into ruin and destruction.
1 Timothy 6-10 For the love of money is a root of <f>ⓤ</f>all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.
1 Timothy 6-11 <pb/>But as for you, <f>ⓥ</f>O man of God, <f>ⓦ</f>flee these things. <f>ⓧ</f>Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.
1 Timothy 6-12 <f>ⓨ</f> Fight the good fight of the faith. <f>ⓩ</f>Take hold of the eternal life <f>ⓐ</f>to which you were called and about which you made <f>ⓑ</f>the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
1 Timothy 6-13 <f>ⓒ</f> I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, <f>ⓓ</f>who in his testimony before <f>[4]</f> Pontius Pilate made <f>ⓔ</f>the good confession,
1 Timothy 6-14 to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until <f>ⓕ</f>the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Timothy 6-15 which he will display <f>ⓖ</f>at the proper time — he who is <f>ⓗ</f>the blessed and only Sovereign, <f>ⓘ</f>the King of kings and Lord of lords,
1 Timothy 6-16 <f>ⓙ</f> who alone has immortality, <f>ⓚ</f>who dwells in <f>ⓛ</f>unapproachable light, <f>ⓜ</f>whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.
1 Timothy 6-17 <pb/>As for the rich in <f>ⓝ</f>this present age, charge them <f>ⓞ</f>not to be haughty, nor <f>ⓟ</f>to set their hopes on <f>ⓠ</f>the uncertainty of riches, but on God, <f>ⓡ</f>who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
1 Timothy 6-18 They are to do good, <f>ⓢ</f>to be rich in good works, to be generous and <f>ⓣ</f>ready to share,
1 Timothy 6-19 thus <f>ⓤ</f>storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may <f>ⓥ</f>take hold of <f>ⓦ</f>that which is truly life.
1 Timothy 6-20 <pb/>O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you. <f>ⓧ</f>Avoid the <f>ⓨ</f>irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called “knowledge,”
1 Timothy 6-21 for by professing it some have swerved from the faith. <pb/><f>ⓩ</f>Grace be with you. <f>[5]</f>
