Genesis 14-1 <pb/>In the days of Amraphel king of <f>ⓐ</f>Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of <f>ⓑ</f>Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
Genesis 14-2 these kings made war with <f>ⓒ</f>Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of <f>ⓓ</f>Admah, Shemeber king of <f>ⓔ</f>Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
Genesis 14-3 And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (<f>ⓕ</f>that is, the Salt Sea).
Genesis 14-4 Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis 14-5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the <f>ⓖ</f>Rephaim in <f>ⓗ</f>Ashteroth-karnaim, the <f>ⓘ</f>Zuzim in Ham, the <f>ⓙ</f>Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
Genesis 14-6 and the <f>ⓚ</f>Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as <f>ⓛ</f>El-paran on the border of the wilderness.
Genesis 14-7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, <f>ⓜ</f>Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling <f>ⓝ</f>in Hazazon-tamar.
Genesis 14-8 <pb/>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim
Genesis 14-9 with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five.
Genesis 14-10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of <f>ⓞ</f>bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled <f>ⓟ</f>to the hill country.
Genesis 14-11 So the enemy took <f>ⓠ</f>all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
Genesis 14-12 They also took Lot, <f>ⓡ</f>the son of Abram's brother, <f>ⓢ</f>who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way.
Genesis 14-13 <pb/>Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, <f>ⓣ</f>who was living by the <f>ⓤ</f>oaks <f>[1]</f> of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.
Genesis 14-14 When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, <f>ⓥ</f>born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as <f>ⓦ</f>Dan.
Genesis 14-15 And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
Genesis 14-16 Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot <f>ⓧ</f>with his possessions, and the women and the people.
Genesis 14-17 <pb/>After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the <f>ⓨ</f>King's Valley).
Genesis 14-18 And <f>ⓩ</f>Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was <f>ⓐ</f>priest of <f>ⓑ</f>God Most High.)
Genesis 14-19 And he blessed him and said, <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Blessed be Abram by God Most High, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>Possessor <f>[2]</f> of heaven and earth;</t>
Genesis 14-20 <t>and blessed be God Most High, </t><t>who has delivered your enemies into your hand!” </t> <pb/>And Abram gave him <f>ⓔ</f>a tenth of everything.
Genesis 14-21 And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.”
Genesis 14-22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, <f>ⓕ</f>“I have lifted my hand <f>[3]</f> to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis 14-23 that <f>ⓖ</f>I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’
Genesis 14-24 I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let <f>ⓗ</f>Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.”
