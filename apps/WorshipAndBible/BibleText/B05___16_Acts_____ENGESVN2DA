Acts 16-1 <pb/>Paul <f>[1]</f> came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named <f>ⓐ</f>Timothy, <f>ⓑ</f>the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.
Acts 16-2 He was well spoken of by <f>ⓒ</f>the brothers <f>[2]</f> at Lystra and Iconium.
Acts 16-3 Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he <f>ⓓ</f>took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts 16-4 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance <f>ⓔ</f>the decisions <f>ⓕ</f>that had been reached by <f>ⓖ</f>the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
Acts 16-5 <f>ⓗ</f> So the churches were strengthened in <f>ⓘ</f>the faith, and they increased in numbers <f>ⓙ</f>daily.
Acts 16-6 <pb/>And <f>ⓚ</f>they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
Acts 16-7 And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but <f>ⓛ</f>the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
Acts 16-8 So, passing by Mysia, they went down <f>ⓜ</f>to Troas.
Acts 16-9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”
Acts 16-10 And when Paul <f>[3]</f> had seen the vision, immediately <f>ⓝ</f>we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
Acts 16-11 <pb/>So, setting sail from Troas, we <f>ⓞ</f>made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis,
Acts 16-12 and from there to <f>ⓟ</f>Philippi, which is a leading city of the <f>[4]</f> district of Macedonia and <f>ⓠ</f>a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days.
Acts 16-13 And <f>ⓡ</f>on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate <f>ⓢ</f>to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we <f>ⓣ</f>sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
Acts 16-14 One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, <f>ⓤ</f>who was a worshiper of God. The Lord <f>ⓥ</f>opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.
Acts 16-15 And after she was baptized, <f>ⓦ</f>and her household as well, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she <f>ⓧ</f>prevailed upon us.
Acts 16-16 <pb/>As we were going to <f>ⓨ</f>the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had <f>ⓩ</f>a spirit of <f>ⓐ</f>divination and <f>ⓑ</f>brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling.
Acts 16-17 She followed Paul and us, <f>ⓒ</f>crying out, “These men are <f>ⓓ</f>servants of <f>ⓔ</f>the Most High God, who proclaim to you <f>ⓕ</f>the way of salvation.”
Acts 16-18 And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, <f>ⓖ</f>“I command you <f>ⓗ</f>in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And <f>ⓘ</f>it came out that very hour.
Acts 16-19 <pb/>But <f>ⓙ</f>when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and <f>ⓚ</f>dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
Acts 16-20 And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city.
Acts 16-21 They <f>ⓛ</f>advocate customs that are not lawful for us <f>ⓜ</f>as Romans to accept or practice.”
Acts 16-22 The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders <f>ⓝ</f>to beat them with rods.
Acts 16-23 And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.
Acts 16-24 Having received this order, he put them into the inner <f>ⓞ</f>prison and fastened their feet in <f>ⓟ</f>the stocks.
Acts 16-25 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,
Acts 16-26 and suddenly <f>ⓡ</f>there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately <f>ⓢ</f>all the doors were opened, and <f>ⓣ</f>everyone's bonds were unfastened.
Acts 16-27 When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and <f>ⓤ</f>was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts 16-28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.”
Acts 16-29 And the jailer <f>[5]</f> called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he <f>ⓥ</f>fell down before Paul and Silas.
Acts 16-30 Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, <f>ⓦ</f>what must I do to be <f>ⓧ</f>saved?”
Acts 16-31 And they said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you <f>ⓩ</f>and your household.”
Acts 16-32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
Acts 16-33 And he took them <f>ⓐ</f>the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he <f>ⓑ</f>was baptized at once, he and all his family.
Acts 16-34 Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he <f>ⓒ</f>rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.
Acts 16-35 <pb/>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, “Let those men go.”
Acts 16-36 And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.”
Acts 16-37 But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly, <f>ⓓ</f>uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.”
Acts 16-38 The police reported these words to the magistrates, and <f>ⓔ</f>they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.
Acts 16-39 So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and <f>ⓕ</f>asked them to leave the city.
Acts 16-40 So they went out of the prison and visited <f>ⓖ</f>Lydia. And when they had seen <f>ⓗ</f>the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.
