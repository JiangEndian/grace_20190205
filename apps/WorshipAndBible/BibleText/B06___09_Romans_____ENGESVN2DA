Romans 9-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> I am speaking the truth in Christ — I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit —
Romans 9-2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
Romans 9-3 For <f>ⓑ</f>I could wish that I myself were <f>ⓒ</f>accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, <f>[1]</f> my kinsmen <f>ⓓ</f>according to the flesh.
Romans 9-4 They are <f>ⓔ</f>Israelites, and to them belong <f>ⓕ</f>the adoption, <f>ⓖ</f>the glory, <f>ⓗ</f>the covenants, <f>ⓘ</f>the giving of the law, <f>ⓙ</f>the worship, and <f>ⓚ</f>the promises.
Romans 9-5 To them belong <f>ⓛ</f>the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, <f>ⓜ</f>who is God over all, <f>ⓝ</f>blessed forever. Amen.
Romans 9-6 <pb/>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,
Romans 9-7 and not all are children of Abraham <f>ⓞ</f>because they are his offspring, but <f>ⓟ</f>“Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.”
Romans 9-8 This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but <f>ⓠ</f>the children of the promise are counted as offspring.
Romans 9-9 For this is what the promise said: <f>ⓡ</f>“About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.”
Romans 9-10 And not only so, but <f>ⓢ</f>also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,
Romans 9-11 though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad — in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of <f>ⓣ</f>him who calls —
Romans 9-12 she was told, <f>ⓤ</f>“The older will serve the younger.”
Romans 9-13 As it is written, <f>ⓥ</f>“Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
Romans 9-14 <pb/>What shall we say then? <f>ⓦ</f>Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!
Romans 9-15 For he says to Moses, <f>ⓧ</f>“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
Romans 9-16 So then it depends not on human will or exertion, <f>[2]</f> but on God, who has mercy.
Romans 9-17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, <f>ⓨ</f>“For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
Romans 9-18 So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
Romans 9-19 <pb/>You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For <f>ⓩ</f>who can resist his will?”
Romans 9-20 But who are you, O man, <f>ⓐ</f>to answer back to God? <f>ⓑ</f>Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?”
Romans 9-21 <f>ⓒ</f> Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump <f>ⓓ</f>one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?
Romans 9-22 What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience <f>ⓔ</f>vessels of wrath <f>ⓕ</f>prepared for destruction,
Romans 9-23 in order to make known <f>ⓖ</f>the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he <f>ⓗ</f>has prepared beforehand for glory —
Romans 9-24 even us whom he <f>ⓘ</f>has called, <f>ⓙ</f>not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?
Romans 9-25 As indeed he says in Hosea, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’ </t><t>and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”</t>
Romans 9-26 <t><f>ⓛ</f> “And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ </t><t>there they will be called <f>ⓜ</f>‘sons of the living God.’” </t>
Romans 9-27 <pb/>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: <f>ⓝ</f>“Though the number of the sons of Israel <f>[3]</f> be as the sand of the sea, <f>ⓞ</f>only a remnant of them will be saved,
Romans 9-28 for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.”
Romans 9-29 And as Isaiah predicted, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> <f>ⓠ</f>“If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>we would have been like Sodom </t><t>and become like Gomorrah.” </t>
Romans 9-30 <pb/>What shall we say, then? <f>ⓢ</f>That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, <f>ⓣ</f>a righteousness that is by faith;
Romans 9-31 but that Israel <f>ⓤ</f>who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>did not succeed in reaching that law.
Romans 9-32 Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the <f>ⓦ</f>stumbling stone,
Romans 9-33 as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f>“Behold, I am laying in Zion <f>ⓨ</f>a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>and whoever believes in him will not be <f>ⓐ</f>put to shame.” </t>
