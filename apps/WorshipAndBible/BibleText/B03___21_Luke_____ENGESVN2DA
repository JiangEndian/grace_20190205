Luke 21-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Jesus <f>[1]</f> looked up and saw the rich <f>ⓑ</f>putting their gifts into <f>ⓒ</f>the offering box,
Luke 21-2 and he saw a poor widow put in two <f>ⓓ</f>small copper coins. <f>[2]</f>
Luke 21-3 And he said, <J>“Truly, I tell you, <f>ⓔ</f>this poor widow has put in more than all of them.</J>
Luke 21-4 <J>For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her <f>ⓕ</f>poverty put in all <f>ⓖ</f>she had to live on.”</J>
Luke 21-5 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> And while some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with noble stones and offerings, he said,
Luke 21-6 <J>“As for these things that you see, <f>ⓘ</f>the days will come when there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.”</J>
Luke 21-7 And they asked him, “Teacher, <f>ⓙ</f>when will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?”
Luke 21-8 And he said, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“See that you are not led astray. For <f>ⓛ</f>many will come in my name, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>‘I am he!’ and, <f>ⓝ</f>‘The time is at hand!’ Do not go after them.</J>
Luke 21-9 <J>And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be <f>ⓞ</f>terrified, for these things <f>ⓟ</f>must first take place, but the end will not be at once.”</J>
Luke 21-10 <pb/>Then he said to them, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“Nation will rise against nation, and <f>ⓡ</f>kingdom against kingdom.</J>
Luke 21-11 <J>There will be great <f>ⓢ</f>earthquakes, and in various places <f>ⓣ</f>famines and pestilences. And there will be <f>ⓤ</f>terrors and great <f>ⓥ</f>signs from heaven.</J>
Luke 21-12 <J>But before all this <f>ⓦ</f>they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to <f>ⓧ</f>the synagogues and <f>ⓨ</f>prisons, and you <f>ⓩ</f>will be brought before <f>ⓐ</f>kings and <f>ⓑ</f>governors for my name's sake.</J>
Luke 21-13 <J><f>ⓒ</f> This will be your opportunity to bear witness.</J>
Luke 21-14 <J>Settle it therefore in your minds <f>ⓓ</f>not to meditate beforehand how to answer,</J>
Luke 21-15 <J>for <f>ⓔ</f>I will give you a mouth and <f>ⓕ</f>wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or <f>ⓖ</f>contradict.</J>
Luke 21-16 <J>You will be delivered up <f>ⓗ</f>even by parents and brothers <f>[3]</f> and relatives and friends, and some of you they will put to death.</J>
Luke 21-17 <J><f>ⓘ</f> You will be hated by all for my name's sake.</J>
Luke 21-18 <J>But <f>ⓙ</f>not a hair of your head will perish.</J>
Luke 21-19 <J>By your <f>ⓚ</f>endurance you will gain your lives.</J>
Luke 21-20 <pb/><J>“But <f>ⓛ</f>when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that <f>ⓜ</f>its desolation has come near.</J>
Luke 21-21 <J>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are inside the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it,</J>
Luke 21-22 <J>for these are <f>ⓝ</f>days of <f>ⓞ</f>vengeance, to fulfill <f>ⓟ</f>all that is written.</J>
Luke 21-23 <J><f>ⓠ</f> Alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth and <f>ⓡ</f>wrath against this people.</J>
Luke 21-24 <J>They will fall by the edge of the sword and <f>ⓢ</f>be led captive among all nations, and <f>ⓣ</f>Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles, <f>ⓤ</f>until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</J>
Luke 21-25 <pb/><J>“And <f>ⓥ</f>there will be signs in sun and moon <f>ⓦ</f>and stars, and on the earth <f>ⓧ</f>distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves,</J>
Luke 21-26 <J>people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For <f>ⓨ</f>the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</J>
Luke 21-27 <J>And then they will see <f>ⓩ</f>the Son of Man coming in a cloud <f>ⓐ</f>with power and great glory.</J>
Luke 21-28 <J>Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and <f>ⓑ</f>raise your heads, because <f>ⓒ</f>your redemption is drawing near.”</J>
Luke 21-29 <pb/>And he told them a parable: <J>“Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</J>
Luke 21-30 <J>As soon as they come out in leaf, you see <f>ⓓ</f>for yourselves and know that the summer is already near.</J>
Luke 21-31 <J>So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that the kingdom of God is near.</J>
Luke 21-32 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all has taken place.</J>
Luke 21-33 <J><f>ⓕ</f> Heaven and earth will pass away, but <f>ⓖ</f>my words will not pass away.</J>
Luke 21-34 <pb/><J>“But watch yourselves <f>ⓗ</f>lest <f>ⓘ</f>your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and <f>ⓙ</f>cares of this life, and <f>ⓚ</f>that day come upon you suddenly <f>ⓛ</f>like a trap.</J>
Luke 21-35 <J>For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</J>
Luke 21-36 <J>But <f>ⓜ</f>stay awake at all times, <f>ⓝ</f>praying that you may <f>ⓞ</f>have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and <f>ⓟ</f>to stand before the Son of Man.”</J>
Luke 21-37 <pb/>And <f>ⓠ</f>every day he was teaching in the temple, but <f>ⓡ</f>at night he went out and lodged on <f>ⓢ</f>the mount called Olivet.
Luke 21-38 And early in the morning <f>ⓣ</f>all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.
