Numbers 31-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 31-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you shall <f>ⓑ</f>be gathered to your people.”
Numbers 31-3 So Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD's vengeance on Midian.
Numbers 31-4 You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war.”
Numbers 31-5 So there were provided, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand <f>ⓒ</f>armed for war.
Numbers 31-6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, together with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the vessels of the sanctuary and <f>ⓓ</f>the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
Numbers 31-7 They warred against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and <f>ⓔ</f>killed every male.
Numbers 31-8 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain, <f>ⓕ</f>Evi, Rekem, <f>ⓖ</f>Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. And they also killed <f>ⓗ</f>Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
Numbers 31-9 And the people of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and they took as plunder all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods.
Numbers 31-10 All their cities in the places where they lived, and all their <f>ⓘ</f>encampments, they burned with fire,
Numbers 31-11 <f>ⓙ</f> and took all the spoil and all the plunder, both of man and of beast.
Numbers 31-12 Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the people of Israel, at the camp on <f>ⓚ</f>the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers 31-13 <pb/>Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
Numbers 31-14 And Moses was angry with <f>ⓛ</f>the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
Numbers 31-15 Moses said to them, “Have you <f>ⓜ</f>let all the women live?
Numbers 31-16 Behold, <f>ⓝ</f>these, <f>ⓞ</f>on Balaam's advice, caused the people of Israel to act treacherously against the LORD in the incident of <f>ⓟ</f>Peor, and so <f>ⓠ</f>the plague came among the congregation of the LORD.
Numbers 31-17 Now therefore, <f>ⓡ</f>kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.
Numbers 31-18 But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him <f>ⓢ</f>keep alive for yourselves.
Numbers 31-19 <f>ⓣ</f> Encamp outside the camp seven days. Whoever of you has killed any person and <f>ⓤ</f>whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.
Numbers 31-20 You shall purify every garment, every article of skin, all work of goats' hair, and every article of wood.”
Numbers 31-21 <pb/>Then Eleazar the priest said to the men in the army who had gone to battle: “This is the statute of the law that the LORD has commanded Moses:
Numbers 31-22 only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
Numbers 31-23 everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless, it shall also be purified <f>ⓥ</f>with the water for impurity. And whatever cannot stand the fire, you shall pass through the water.
Numbers 31-24 You must <f>ⓦ</f>wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. And afterward you may come into the camp.”
Numbers 31-25 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses,
Numbers 31-26 “Take the count of the plunder that was taken, both of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' houses of the congregation,
Numbers 31-27 and <f>ⓧ</f>divide the plunder into two parts between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
Numbers 31-28 And levy for the LORD a tribute from the men of war who went out to battle, <f>ⓨ</f>one out of five hundred, of the people and of the oxen and of the donkeys and of the flocks.
Numbers 31-29 Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the LORD.
Numbers 31-30 And from the people of Israel's half you shall take <f>ⓩ</f>one drawn out of every fifty, of the people, of the oxen, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites <f>ⓐ</f>who keep guard over the tabernacle of the LORD.”
Numbers 31-31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 31-32 <pb/>Now the plunder remaining of the spoil that the army took was 675,000 sheep,
Numbers 31-33 72,000 cattle,
Numbers 31-34 61,000 donkeys,
Numbers 31-35 and 32,000 persons in all, women who had not known man by lying with him.
Numbers 31-36 And the half, the portion of those who had gone out in the army, numbered 337,500 sheep,
Numbers 31-37 and <f>ⓑ</f>the LORD's tribute of sheep was 675.
Numbers 31-38 The cattle were 36,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 72.
Numbers 31-39 The donkeys were 30,500, of which the LORD's tribute was 61.
Numbers 31-40 The persons were 16,000, of which the LORD's tribute was 32 persons.
Numbers 31-41 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the contribution for the LORD, to Eleazar the priest, <f>ⓒ</f>as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 31-42 <pb/>From the people of Israel's half, which Moses separated from that of the men who had served in the army —
Numbers 31-43 now the congregation's half was 337,500 sheep,
Numbers 31-44 36,000 cattle,
Numbers 31-45 and 30,500 donkeys,
Numbers 31-46 and 16,000 persons —
Numbers 31-47 <f>ⓓ</f> from the people of Israel's half Moses took one of every 50, both of persons and of beasts, and gave them to the Levites who kept guard over the tabernacle of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 31-48 <pb/>Then <f>ⓔ</f>the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses
Numbers 31-49 and said to Moses, “Your servants have counted the men of war who are under our command, and there is not a man missing from us.
Numbers 31-50 And we have brought the LORD's offering, what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and beads, <f>ⓕ</f>to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.”
Numbers 31-51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them the gold, all crafted articles.
Numbers 31-52 And all the gold of the contribution that they presented to the LORD, from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, was 16,750 shekels. <f>[1]</f>
Numbers 31-53 <f>ⓖ</f> (The men in the army had each taken plunder for himself.)
Numbers 31-54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, <f>ⓗ</f>as a memorial for the people of Israel before the LORD.
