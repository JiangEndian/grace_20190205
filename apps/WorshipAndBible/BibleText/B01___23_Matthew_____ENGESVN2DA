Matthew 23-1 <pb/>Then Jesus <f>ⓐ</f>said to the crowds and to his disciples,
Matthew 23-2 <J><f>ⓑ</f> “The scribes and the Pharisees <f>ⓒ</f>sit on Moses' seat,</J>
Matthew 23-3 <J>so do and observe whatever they tell you, <f>ⓓ</f>but not the works they do. <f>ⓔ</f>For they preach, but do not practice.</J>
Matthew 23-4 <J><f>ⓕ</f> They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, <f>[1]</f> and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.</J>
Matthew 23-5 <J><f>ⓖ</f> They do all their deeds <f>ⓗ</f>to be seen by others. For they make <f>ⓘ</f>their phylacteries broad and <f>ⓙ</f>their fringes long,</J>
Matthew 23-6 <J>and they <f>ⓚ</f>love the place of honor at feasts and <f>ⓛ</f>the best seats in the synagogues</J>
Matthew 23-7 <J>and <f>ⓜ</f>greetings in <f>ⓝ</f>the marketplaces and being called <f>ⓞ</f>rabbi <f>[2]</f> by others.</J>
Matthew 23-8 <J><f>ⓟ</f> But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are <f>ⓠ</f>all brothers. <f>[3]</f></J>
Matthew 23-9 <J><f>ⓡ</f> And call no man your father on earth, for <f>ⓢ</f>you have one Father, who is in heaven.</J>
Matthew 23-10 <J>Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, <f>ⓣ</f>the Christ.</J>
Matthew 23-11 <J><f>ⓤ</f> The greatest among you shall be your servant.</J>
Matthew 23-12 <J><f>ⓥ</f> Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</J>
Matthew 23-13 <pb/><J>“But woe <f>ⓦ</f>to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you <f>ⓧ</f>shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. For you <f>ⓨ</f>neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. <f>[4]</f></J>
Matthew 23-14 
Matthew 23-15 <J>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single <f>ⓩ</f>proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a <f>ⓐ</f>child of <f>ⓑ</f>hell <f>[5]</f> as yourselves.</J>
Matthew 23-16 <pb/><J>“Woe to <f>ⓒ</f>you, <f>ⓓ</f>blind guides, who say, <f>ⓔ</f>‘If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.’</J>
Matthew 23-17 <J>You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or <f>ⓕ</f>the temple that has made the gold sacred?</J>
Matthew 23-18 <J>And you say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by <f>ⓖ</f>the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.’</J>
Matthew 23-19 <J>You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or <f>ⓗ</f>the altar that makes the gift sacred?</J>
Matthew 23-20 <J>So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.</J>
Matthew 23-21 <J>And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by <f>ⓘ</f>him who dwells in it.</J>
Matthew 23-22 <J>And whoever swears by <f>ⓙ</f>heaven swears by <f>ⓚ</f>the throne of God and by <f>ⓛ</f>him who sits upon it.</J>
Matthew 23-23 <pb/><J><f>ⓜ</f> “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For <f>ⓝ</f>you tithe mint and dill and <f>ⓞ</f>cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: <f>ⓟ</f>justice and mercy and faithfulness. <f>ⓠ</f>These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</J>
Matthew 23-24 <J>You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing <f>ⓡ</f>a camel!</J>
Matthew 23-25 <pb/><J><f>ⓢ</f> “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For <f>ⓣ</f>you clean the outside of <f>ⓤ</f>the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of <f>ⓥ</f>greed and self-indulgence.</J>
Matthew 23-26 <J>You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of <f>ⓦ</f>the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean.</J>
Matthew 23-27 <pb/><J><f>ⓧ</f> “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like <f>ⓨ</f>whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and <f>ⓩ</f>all uncleanness.</J>
Matthew 23-28 <J>So you also <f>ⓐ</f>outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of <f>ⓑ</f>hypocrisy and lawlessness.</J>
Matthew 23-29 <pb/><J><f>ⓒ</f> “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous,</J>
Matthew 23-30 <J>saying, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’</J>
Matthew 23-31 <J>Thus you witness against yourselves that you are <f>ⓓ</f>sons of those who murdered the prophets.</J>
Matthew 23-32 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.</J>
Matthew 23-33 <J>You serpents, <f>ⓕ</f>you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to <f>ⓖ</f>hell?</J>
Matthew 23-34 <J><f>ⓗ</f> Therefore <f>ⓘ</f>I send you <f>ⓙ</f>prophets and wise men and <f>ⓚ</f>scribes, <f>ⓛ</f>some of whom you will kill and crucify, and <f>ⓜ</f>some you will <f>ⓝ</f>flog in your synagogues and <f>ⓞ</f>persecute from town to town,</J>
Matthew 23-35 <J>so that on you may come all <f>ⓟ</f>the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous <f>ⓠ</f>Abel to the blood of <f>ⓡ</f>Zechariah the son of Barachiah, <f>[6]</f> whom you murdered between <f>ⓢ</f>the sanctuary and <f>ⓣ</f>the altar.</J>
Matthew 23-36 <J>Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓤ</f>all these things will come upon this generation.</J>
Matthew 23-37 <pb/><J><f>ⓥ</f> “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that <f>ⓦ</f>kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have <f>ⓧ</f>gathered <f>ⓨ</f>your children together <f>ⓩ</f>as a hen gathers her brood <f>ⓐ</f>under her wings, and <f>ⓑ</f>you were not willing!</J>
Matthew 23-38 <J>See, <f>ⓒ</f>your house is left to you desolate.</J>
Matthew 23-39 <J>For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’”</J>
