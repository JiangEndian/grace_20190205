Ezekiel 15-1 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 15-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, how does <f>ⓑ</f>the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?
Ezekiel 15-3 Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take <f>ⓒ</f>a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?
Ezekiel 15-4 <f>ⓓ</f> Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?
Ezekiel 15-5 <f>ⓔ</f> Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!
Ezekiel 15-6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓕ</f>Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, <f>ⓖ</f>which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel 15-7 <f>ⓗ</f> And I will set my face against them. Though <f>ⓘ</f>they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, <f>ⓙ</f>and you will know that I am the LORD, <f>ⓚ</f>when I set my face against them.
Ezekiel 15-8 <f>ⓛ</f> And I will make the land desolate, because <f>ⓜ</f>they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord GOD.”
