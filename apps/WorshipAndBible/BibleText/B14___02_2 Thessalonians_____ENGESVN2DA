2 Thessalonians 2-1 <pb/>Now concerning <f>ⓐ</f>the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our <f>ⓑ</f>being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, <f>[1]</f>
2 Thessalonians 2-2 not to be quickly shaken in mind or <f>ⓒ</f>alarmed, either <f>ⓓ</f>by a spirit or a <f>ⓔ</f>spoken word, or <f>ⓕ</f>a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that <f>ⓖ</f>the day of the Lord has come.
2 Thessalonians 2-3 <f>ⓗ</f> Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, <f>ⓘ</f>unless the rebellion comes first, and <f>ⓙ</f>the man of lawlessness <f>[2]</f> is revealed, <f>ⓚ</f>the son of destruction, <f>[3]</f>
2 Thessalonians 2-4 who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, <f>ⓛ</f>proclaiming himself to be God.
2 Thessalonians 2-5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?
2 Thessalonians 2-6 And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.
2 Thessalonians 2-7 For <f>ⓜ</f>the mystery of lawlessness <f>ⓝ</f>is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.
2 Thessalonians 2-8 And then <f>ⓞ</f>the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus <f>ⓟ</f>will kill with <f>ⓠ</f>the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by <f>ⓡ</f>the appearance of his coming.
2 Thessalonians 2-9 The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan <f>ⓢ</f>with all power and false signs and wonders,
2 Thessalonians 2-10 and with all wicked deception for <f>ⓣ</f>those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
2 Thessalonians 2-11 Therefore <f>ⓤ</f>God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe <f>ⓥ</f>what is false,
2 Thessalonians 2-12 in order that all may be condemned <f>ⓦ</f>who did not believe the truth but <f>ⓧ</f>had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians 2-13 <pb/>But <f>ⓨ</f>we ought always to give thanks to God for you, <f>ⓩ</f>brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you <f>ⓐ</f>as the firstfruits <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>to be saved, <f>ⓒ</f>through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.
2 Thessalonians 2-14 To this he called you through <f>ⓓ</f>our gospel, <f>ⓔ</f>so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians 2-15 So then, brothers, <f>ⓕ</f>stand firm and hold to <f>ⓖ</f>the traditions that you were taught by us, either <f>ⓗ</f>by our spoken word or by <f>ⓘ</f>our letter.
2 Thessalonians 2-16 <pb/>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, <f>ⓙ</f>who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good <f>ⓚ</f>hope through grace,
2 Thessalonians 2-17 comfort your hearts and <f>ⓛ</f>establish them in every good work and word.
