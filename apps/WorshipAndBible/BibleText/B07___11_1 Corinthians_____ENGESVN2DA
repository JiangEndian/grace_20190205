1 Corinthians 11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
1 Corinthians 11-2 <pb/>Now I commend you <f>ⓑ</f>because you remember me in everything and <f>ⓒ</f>maintain the traditions <f>ⓓ</f>even as I delivered them to you.
1 Corinthians 11-3 But I want you to understand that <f>ⓔ</f>the head of every man is Christ, <f>ⓕ</f>the head of a wife <f>[1]</f> is her husband, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>the head of Christ is God.
1 Corinthians 11-4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head,
1 Corinthians 11-5 but every wife <f>[3]</f> who prays or <f>ⓗ</f>prophesies <f>ⓘ</f>with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same <f>ⓙ</f>as if her head were shaven.
1 Corinthians 11-6 For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head.
1 Corinthians 11-7 For a man ought not to cover his head, since <f>ⓚ</f>he is the image and glory of God, but <f>ⓛ</f>woman is the glory of man.
1 Corinthians 11-8 For <f>ⓜ</f>man was not made from woman, but woman from man.
1 Corinthians 11-9 Neither was man created for woman, but <f>ⓝ</f>woman for man.
1 Corinthians 11-10 That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. <f>[4]</f>
1 Corinthians 11-11 Nevertheless, <f>ⓞ</f>in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman;
1 Corinthians 11-12 for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And <f>ⓟ</f>all things are from God.
1 Corinthians 11-13 Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered?
1 Corinthians 11-14 Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him,
1 Corinthians 11-15 but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
1 Corinthians 11-16 <f>ⓠ</f> If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do <f>ⓡ</f>the churches of God.
1 Corinthians 11-17 <pb/>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
1 Corinthians 11-18 For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, <f>ⓢ</f>I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, <f>[5]</f>
1 Corinthians 11-19 for <f>ⓣ</f>there must be factions among you in order <f>ⓤ</f>that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.
1 Corinthians 11-20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.
1 Corinthians 11-21 For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, <f>ⓥ</f>another gets drunk.
1 Corinthians 11-22 What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise <f>ⓦ</f>the church of God and <f>ⓧ</f>humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.
1 Corinthians 11-23 <pb/>For <f>ⓨ</f>I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that <f>ⓩ</f>the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,
1 Corinthians 11-24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <J>“This is my body, which is for <f>[6]</f> you. Do this in remembrance of me.” <f>[7]</f></J>
1 Corinthians 11-25 In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <J>“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</J>
1 Corinthians 11-26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death <f>ⓐ</f>until he comes.
1 Corinthians 11-27 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord <f>ⓒ</f>in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning <f>ⓓ</f>the body and blood of the Lord.
1 Corinthians 11-28 <f>ⓔ</f> Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
1 Corinthians 11-29 For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.
1 Corinthians 11-30 That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some <f>ⓕ</f>have died. <f>[8]</f>
1 Corinthians 11-31 <f>ⓖ</f> But if we judged <f>[9]</f> ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
1 Corinthians 11-32 But when we are judged by the Lord, <f>ⓗ</f>we are disciplined <f>[10]</f> so that we may not be <f>ⓘ</f>condemned along with the world.
1 Corinthians 11-33 <pb/>So then, my brothers, <f>[11]</f> when you come together to eat, wait for <f>[12]</f> one another —
1 Corinthians 11-34 <f>ⓙ</f> if anyone is hungry, <f>ⓚ</f>let him eat at home — so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things <f>ⓛ</f>I will give directions <f>ⓜ</f>when I come.
