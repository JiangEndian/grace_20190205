Numbers 12-1 <pb/>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.
Numbers 12-2 And they said, “Has the LORD indeed spoken only through Moses? <f>ⓐ</f>Has he not spoken through us also?” And <f>ⓑ</f>the LORD heard it.
Numbers 12-3 Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.
Numbers 12-4 And suddenly the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.” And the three of them came out.
Numbers 12-5 And <f>ⓒ</f>the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.
Numbers 12-6 And he said, “Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD make myself known to him <f>ⓓ</f>in a vision; I speak with him <f>ⓔ</f>in a dream.
Numbers 12-7 Not so with <f>ⓕ</f>my servant Moses. <f>ⓖ</f>He is faithful in all my house.
Numbers 12-8 With him I speak <f>ⓗ</f>mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in <f>ⓘ</f>riddles, and he beholds <f>ⓙ</f>the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”
Numbers 12-9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and he departed.
Numbers 12-10 <pb/>When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, <f>ⓚ</f>Miriam was <f>ⓛ</f>leprous, <f>[1]</f> like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
Numbers 12-11 And Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, <f>ⓜ</f>do not punish us <f>[2]</f> because we have done foolishly and have sinned.
Numbers 12-12 Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother's womb.”
Numbers 12-13 And Moses cried to the LORD, “O God, please heal her — please.”
Numbers 12-14 But the LORD said to Moses, “If her father had but <f>ⓝ</f>spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be <f>ⓞ</f>shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.”
Numbers 12-15 So Miriam <f>ⓟ</f>was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again.
Numbers 12-16 After that the people set out from <f>ⓠ</f>Hazeroth, and camped in <f>ⓡ</f>the wilderness of Paran.
