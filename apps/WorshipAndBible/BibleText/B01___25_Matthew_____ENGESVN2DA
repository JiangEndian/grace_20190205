Matthew 25-1 <pb/><J>“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like <f>ⓐ</f>ten virgins who took their lamps <f>[1]</f> and went to meet <f>ⓑ</f>the bridegroom. <f>[2]</f></J>
Matthew 25-2 <J>Five of them were foolish, and five were <f>ⓒ</f>wise.</J>
Matthew 25-3 <J>For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,</J>
Matthew 25-4 <J>but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.</J>
Matthew 25-5 <J>As the bridegroom <f>ⓓ</f>was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.</J>
Matthew 25-6 <J>But <f>ⓔ</f>at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’</J>
Matthew 25-7 <J>Then all those virgins rose and <f>ⓕ</f>trimmed their lamps.</J>
Matthew 25-8 <J>And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’</J>
Matthew 25-9 <J>But the wise answered, saying, ‘Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’</J>
Matthew 25-10 <J>And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and <f>ⓖ</f>those who were ready went in with him to <f>ⓗ</f>the marriage feast, and <f>ⓘ</f>the door was shut.</J>
Matthew 25-11 <J>Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>‘Lord, lord, open to us.’</J>
Matthew 25-12 <J><f>ⓚ</f> But he answered, ‘Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓛ</f>I do not know you.’</J>
Matthew 25-13 <J><f>ⓜ</f> Watch therefore, for you <f>ⓝ</f>know neither the day nor the hour.</J>
Matthew 25-14 <pb/><J><f>ⓞ</f> “For <f>ⓟ</f>it will be like a man <f>ⓠ</f>going on a journey, who called his servants <f>[3]</f> and entrusted to them his property.</J>
Matthew 25-15 <J>To one he gave five <f>ⓡ</f>talents, <f>[4]</f> to another two, to another one, <f>ⓢ</f>to each according to his ability. Then he <f>ⓣ</f>went away.</J>
Matthew 25-16 <J>He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more.</J>
Matthew 25-17 <J>So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.</J>
Matthew 25-18 <J>But he who had received the one talent went and <f>ⓤ</f>dug in the ground and hid his master's money.</J>
Matthew 25-19 <J>Now <f>ⓥ</f>after a long time the master of those servants came and <f>ⓦ</f>settled accounts with them.</J>
Matthew 25-20 <J>And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.’</J>
Matthew 25-21 <J>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and <f>ⓧ</f>faithful servant. <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓨ</f>You have been faithful over a little; <f>ⓩ</f>I will set you over much. Enter into <f>ⓐ</f>the joy of your master.’</J>
Matthew 25-22 <J>And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.’</J>
Matthew 25-23 <J>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’</J>
Matthew 25-24 <J>He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be <f>ⓑ</f>a hard man, reaping <f>ⓒ</f>where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,</J>
Matthew 25-25 <J>so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, <f>ⓓ</f>you have what is yours.’</J>
Matthew 25-26 <J>But his master answered him, ‘You <f>ⓔ</f>wicked and <f>ⓕ</f>slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed?</J>
Matthew 25-27 <J>Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest.</J>
Matthew 25-28 <J>So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.</J>
Matthew 25-29 <J><f>ⓖ</f> For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</J>
Matthew 25-30 <J>And <f>ⓗ</f>cast <f>ⓘ</f>the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place <f>ⓙ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</J>
Matthew 25-31 <pb/><J><f>ⓚ</f> “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, <f>ⓛ</f>then he will sit on his glorious throne.</J>
Matthew 25-32 <J>Before him <f>ⓜ</f>will be gathered <f>ⓝ</f>all the nations, and <f>ⓞ</f>he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates <f>ⓟ</f>the sheep from the goats.</J>
Matthew 25-33 <J>And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.</J>
Matthew 25-34 <J>Then <f>ⓠ</f>the King will say to <f>ⓡ</f>those on his right, ‘Come, you <f>ⓢ</f>who are blessed by my Father, <f>ⓣ</f>inherit <f>ⓤ</f>the kingdom <f>ⓥ</f>prepared for you <f>ⓦ</f>from the foundation of the world.</J>
Matthew 25-35 <J>For <f>ⓧ</f>I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you <f>ⓨ</f>gave me drink, <f>ⓩ</f>I was a stranger and you welcomed me,</J>
Matthew 25-36 <J><f>ⓐ</f> I was naked and you clothed me, <f>ⓑ</f>I was sick and you <f>ⓒ</f>visited me, <f>ⓓ</f>I was in prison and you came to me.’</J>
Matthew 25-37 <J>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</J>
Matthew 25-38 <J>And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?</J>
Matthew 25-39 <J>And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’</J>
Matthew 25-40 <J>And <f>ⓔ</f>the King will answer them, <f>ⓕ</f>‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these <f>ⓖ</f>my brothers, <f>[6]</f> you did it to me.’</J>
Matthew 25-41 <pb/><J>“Then he will say to those on his left, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Depart from me, you <f>ⓘ</f>cursed, into <f>ⓙ</f>the eternal fire prepared for <f>ⓚ</f>the devil and his angels.</J>
Matthew 25-42 <J>For <f>ⓛ</f>I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,</J>
Matthew 25-43 <J>I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’</J>
Matthew 25-44 <J>Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’</J>
Matthew 25-45 <J>Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, <f>ⓜ</f>you did not do it to me.’</J>
Matthew 25-46 <J>And these will go away <f>ⓝ</f>into eternal punishment, but the righteous <f>ⓞ</f>into <f>ⓟ</f>eternal life.”</J>
