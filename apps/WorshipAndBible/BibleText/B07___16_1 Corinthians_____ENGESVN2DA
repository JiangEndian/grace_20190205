1 Corinthians 16-1 <pb/>Now concerning <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do.
1 Corinthians 16-2 On <f>ⓑ</f>the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, <f>ⓒ</f>as he may prosper, <f>ⓓ</f>so that there will be no collecting when I come.
1 Corinthians 16-3 And when I arrive, I will send <f>ⓔ</f>those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
1 Corinthians 16-4 If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
1 Corinthians 16-5 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> I will visit you after passing through <f>ⓖ</f>Macedonia, for <f>ⓗ</f>I intend to pass through Macedonia,
1 Corinthians 16-6 and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may <f>ⓘ</f>help me on my journey, wherever I go.
1 Corinthians 16-7 For I do not want to see you now <f>ⓙ</f>just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, <f>ⓚ</f>if the Lord permits.
1 Corinthians 16-8 But I will stay in Ephesus until <f>ⓛ</f>Pentecost,
1 Corinthians 16-9 for <f>ⓜ</f>a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and <f>ⓝ</f>there are many adversaries.
1 Corinthians 16-10 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for <f>ⓟ</f>he is doing <f>ⓠ</f>the work of the Lord, as I am.
1 Corinthians 16-11 So <f>ⓡ</f>let no one despise him. <f>ⓢ</f>Help him on his way <f>ⓣ</f>in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.
1 Corinthians 16-12 <pb/>Now concerning <f>ⓤ</f>our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will <f>[2]</f> to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.
1 Corinthians 16-13 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Be watchful, <f>ⓦ</f>stand firm in the faith, <f>ⓧ</f>act like men, <f>ⓨ</f>be strong.
1 Corinthians 16-14 <f>ⓩ</f> Let all that you do be done in love.
1 Corinthians 16-15 <pb/>Now I urge you, brothers <f>[3]</f> — you know that <f>ⓐ</f>the household <f>[4]</f> of Stephanas were <f>ⓑ</f>the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves <f>ⓒ</f>to the service of the saints —
1 Corinthians 16-16 <f>ⓓ</f> be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.
1 Corinthians 16-17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for <f>ⓔ</f>your absence,
1 Corinthians 16-18 for they <f>ⓕ</f>refreshed my spirit as well as yours. <f>ⓖ</f>Give recognition to such people.
1 Corinthians 16-19 <pb/>The churches of Asia send you greetings. <f>ⓗ</f>Aquila and Prisca, together with <f>ⓘ</f>the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 16-20 All the brothers send you greetings. <f>ⓙ</f>Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians 16-21 <pb/>I, Paul, write <f>ⓚ</f>this greeting with my own hand.
1 Corinthians 16-22 If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be <f>ⓛ</f>accursed. Our Lord, come! <f>[5]</f>
1 Corinthians 16-23 <f>ⓜ</f> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1 Corinthians 16-24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
