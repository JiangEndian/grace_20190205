2 Corinthians 5-1 <pb/>For we know that if <f>ⓐ</f>the tent that is <f>ⓑ</f>our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, <f>ⓒ</f>a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
2 Corinthians 5-2 For in this tent <f>ⓓ</f>we groan, longing to <f>ⓔ</f>put on our heavenly dwelling,
2 Corinthians 5-3 if indeed by putting it on <f>[1]</f> we may not be found naked.
2 Corinthians 5-4 For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened — not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal <f>ⓕ</f>may be swallowed up by life.
2 Corinthians 5-5 He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, <f>ⓖ</f>who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
2 Corinthians 5-6 <pb/>So we are always of good courage. We know that <f>ⓗ</f>while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,
2 Corinthians 5-7 for <f>ⓘ</f>we walk by faith, not <f>ⓙ</f>by sight.
2 Corinthians 5-8 Yes, we are of good courage, and we <f>ⓚ</f>would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
2 Corinthians 5-9 So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to <f>ⓛ</f>please him.
2 Corinthians 5-10 For <f>ⓜ</f>we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, <f>ⓝ</f>so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.
2 Corinthians 5-11 <pb/>Therefore, knowing <f>ⓞ</f>the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But <f>ⓟ</f>what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.
2 Corinthians 5-12 <f>ⓠ</f> We are not commending ourselves to you again but <f>ⓡ</f>giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart.
2 Corinthians 5-13 For if we <f>ⓢ</f>are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
2 Corinthians 5-14 For the love of Christ <f>ⓣ</f>controls us, because we have concluded this: that <f>ⓤ</f>one has died for all, therefore all have died;
2 Corinthians 5-15 and he died for all, <f>ⓥ</f>that those who live might no longer live for themselves but <f>ⓦ</f>for him who for their sake died and was raised.
2 Corinthians 5-16 <pb/>From now on, therefore, <f>ⓧ</f>we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.
2 Corinthians 5-17 Therefore, if anyone is <f>ⓨ</f>in Christ, he is <f>ⓩ</f>a new creation. <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
2 Corinthians 5-18 All this is from God, <f>ⓑ</f>who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us <f>ⓒ</f>the ministry of reconciliation;
2 Corinthians 5-19 that is, in Christ God was reconciling <f>[3]</f> the world to himself, <f>ⓓ</f>not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us <f>ⓔ</f>the message of reconciliation.
2 Corinthians 5-20 Therefore, <f>ⓕ</f>we are ambassadors for Christ, <f>ⓖ</f>God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
2 Corinthians 5-21 <f>ⓗ</f> For our sake he made him to be sin <f>ⓘ</f>who knew no sin, so that in him we might become <f>ⓙ</f>the righteousness of God.
