Genesis 33-1 <pb/>And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, <f>ⓐ</f>Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants.
Genesis 33-2 And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.
Genesis 33-3 He himself went on before them, <f>ⓑ</f>bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Genesis 33-4 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him <f>ⓓ</f>and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
Genesis 33-5 And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob said, <f>ⓔ</f>“The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
Genesis 33-6 Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down.
Genesis 33-7 Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.
Genesis 33-8 Esau said, “What do you mean by <f>ⓕ</f>all this company <f>[1]</f> that I met?” Jacob answered, <f>ⓖ</f>“To find favor in the sight of my lord.”
Genesis 33-9 But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”
Genesis 33-10 Jacob said, “No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. <f>ⓗ</f>For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me.
Genesis 33-11 Please accept my <f>ⓘ</f>blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” Thus he <f>ⓙ</f>urged him, and he took it.
Genesis 33-12 <pb/>Then Esau said, “Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of <f>[2]</f> you.”
Genesis 33-13 But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die.
Genesis 33-14 Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord <f>ⓚ</f>in Seir.”
Genesis 33-15 <pb/>So Esau said, “Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “What need is there? <f>ⓛ</f>Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
Genesis 33-16 So Esau returned that day on his way to <f>ⓜ</f>Seir.
Genesis 33-17 But Jacob journeyed to <f>ⓝ</f>Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. <f>[3]</f>
Genesis 33-18 <pb/>And Jacob came safely <f>[4]</f> to the city of <f>ⓞ</f>Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city.
Genesis 33-19 And from the sons of <f>ⓟ</f>Hamor, Shechem's father, <f>ⓠ</f>he bought for a hundred pieces of money <f>[5]</f> the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent.
Genesis 33-20 There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel. <f>[6]</f>
