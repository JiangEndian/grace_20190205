Revelation 15-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, <f>ⓑ</f>seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished.
Revelation 15-2 <pb/>And I saw <f>ⓒ</f>what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire — and also those <f>ⓓ</f>who had conquered the beast and its image and <f>ⓔ</f>the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass <f>ⓕ</f>with harps of God in their hands.
Revelation 15-3 And they sing <f>ⓖ</f>the song of Moses, <f>ⓗ</f>the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f>“Great and amazing are your deeds, </t><t>O Lord God the Almighty! </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>Just and true are your ways, </t><t>O King of the nations! <f>[1]</f></t>
Revelation 15-4 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Who will not fear, O Lord, </t><t>and glorify your name? </t><t>For you alone are <f>ⓛ</f>holy. </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>All nations will come </t><t>and worship you, </t><t>for your righteous acts have been revealed.” </t>
Revelation 15-5 <pb/>After this I looked, and <f>ⓝ</f>the sanctuary of <f>ⓞ</f>the tent <f>[2]</f> of witness in heaven was opened,
Revelation 15-6 and out of the sanctuary came <f>ⓟ</f>the seven angels with the seven plagues, clothed in pure, bright <f>ⓠ</f>linen, <f>ⓡ</f>with golden sashes around their chests.
Revelation 15-7 And one of <f>ⓢ</f>the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven <f>ⓣ</f>golden bowls full of the wrath of God <f>ⓤ</f>who lives forever and ever,
Revelation 15-8 and <f>ⓥ</f>the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and <f>ⓦ</f>no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
