Jeremiah 12-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Righteous are you, O LORD, </t><t>when I complain to you; </t><t>yet I would plead my case before you. </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>Why does the way of the wicked prosper? </t><t>Why do all <f>ⓒ</f>who are treacherous thrive?</t>
Jeremiah 12-2 <t>You plant them, and they take root; </t><t>they grow and produce fruit; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>you are near in their mouth </t><t>and far from their heart.</t>
Jeremiah 12-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> But you, O LORD, know me; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>you see me, and test my heart toward you. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, </t><t>and set them apart for <f>ⓗ</f>the day of slaughter.</t>
Jeremiah 12-4 <t><f>ⓘ</f> How long will the land mourn </t><t>and the grass of every field wither? </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>For the evil of those who dwell in it </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>the beasts and the birds are swept away, </t><t>because they said, “He will not see our latter end.” </t>
Jeremiah 12-5 <pb/><t>“If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you, </t><t>how will you compete with horses? </t><t>And if in a safe land you are so trusting, </t><t>what will you do in <f>ⓛ</f>the thicket of the Jordan?</t>
Jeremiah 12-6 <t>For <f>ⓜ</f>even your brothers and the house of your father, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>even they have dealt treacherously with you; </t><t>they are in full cry after you; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>do not believe them, </t><t>though they speak friendly words to you.” </t>
Jeremiah 12-7 <pb/><t>“I have forsaken my house; </t><t>I have abandoned <f>ⓟ</f>my heritage; </t><t>I have given <f>ⓠ</f>the beloved of my soul </t><t>into the hands of her enemies.</t>
Jeremiah 12-8 <t><f>ⓡ</f> My heritage has become to me </t><t>like a lion in the forest; </t><t>she has lifted up her voice against me; </t><t>therefore I hate her.</t>
Jeremiah 12-9 <t>Is <f>ⓢ</f>my heritage to me like <f>ⓣ</f>a hyena's lair? </t><t>Are the <f>ⓤ</f>birds of prey against her all around? </t><t>Go, <f>ⓥ</f>assemble all the wild beasts; </t><t>bring them to devour.</t>
Jeremiah 12-10 <t>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard; </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>they have trampled down my portion; </t><t>they have made my pleasant portion </t><t>a desolate wilderness.</t>
Jeremiah 12-11 <t>They have made it a desolation; </t><t>desolate, <f>ⓧ</f>it mourns to me. </t><t>The whole land is made desolate, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>but no man lays it to heart.</t>
Jeremiah 12-12 <t>Upon all the bare heights in the desert </t><t>destroyers have come, </t><t>for the sword of the LORD devours </t><t>from one end of the land to the other; </t><t>no flesh has peace.</t>
Jeremiah 12-13 <t><f>ⓩ</f> They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>they have tired themselves out but profit nothing. </t><t>They shall be ashamed of their <f>[1]</f> harvests </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>because of the fierce anger of the LORD.” </t>
Jeremiah 12-14 <pb/>Thus says the LORD concerning all <f>ⓒ</f>my evil neighbors <f>ⓓ</f>who touch the heritage that <f>ⓔ</f>I have given my people Israel to inherit: “Behold, I will pluck them up from their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
Jeremiah 12-15 And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, <f>ⓕ</f>and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land.
Jeremiah 12-16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, <f>ⓖ</f>to swear by my name, ‘As the LORD lives,’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, <f>ⓗ</f>then they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
Jeremiah 12-17 <f>ⓘ</f> But if any nation will not listen, then I will utterly pluck it up and destroy it, declares the LORD.”
