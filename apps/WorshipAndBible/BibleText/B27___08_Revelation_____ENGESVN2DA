Revelation 8-3 And another angel came and stood <f>ⓒ</f>at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with <f>ⓓ</f>the prayers of all the saints on <f>ⓔ</f>the golden altar before the throne,
Revelation 8-4 and <f>ⓕ</f>the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.
Revelation 8-5 Then the angel took the censer and <f>ⓖ</f>filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and <f>ⓗ</f>there were peals of <f>ⓘ</f>thunder, rumblings, <f>[1]</f> flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
Revelation 8-6 <pb/>Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
Revelation 8-7 <pb/>The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed <f>ⓙ</f>hail and <f>ⓚ</f>fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a <f>ⓛ</f>third of the earth was burned up, and a third of <f>ⓜ</f>the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
