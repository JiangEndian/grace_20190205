Amos 7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, <f>ⓑ</f>he was forming locusts when the latter growth was just beginning to sprout, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.
Amos 7-2 When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said, <pb/><t>“O Lord GOD, please forgive! </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>How can Jacob stand? </t><t>He is so small!”</t>
Amos 7-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> The LORD relented concerning this: </t><t>“It shall not be,” said the LORD. </t>
Amos 7-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, the Lord GOD was calling <f>ⓕ</f>for a judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land.
Amos 7-5 Then I said, <pb/><t>“O Lord GOD, please cease! </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>How can Jacob stand? </t><t>He is so small!”</t>
Amos 7-6 <t><f>ⓗ</f> The LORD relented concerning this: </t><t>“This also shall not be,” said the Lord GOD. </t>
Amos 7-7 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> This is what he showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with <f>ⓙ</f>a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.
Amos 7-8 And the LORD said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said, <pb/><t>“Behold, I am setting <f>ⓛ</f>a plumb line </t><t>in the midst of my people Israel; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>I will never again pass by them;</t>
Amos 7-9 <t><f>ⓝ</f> the high places of Isaac shall be made desolate, </t><t>and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, </t><t>and I will rise against <f>ⓞ</f>the house of Jeroboam with the sword.” </t>
Amos 7-10 <pb/>Then Amaziah <f>ⓟ</f>the priest of Bethel sent to <f>ⓠ</f>Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has <f>ⓡ</f>conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.
Amos 7-11 For thus Amos has said, <pb/><t>“‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>Israel must go into exile </t><t>away from his land.’” </t>
Amos 7-12 <pb/>And Amaziah said to Amos, <f>ⓣ</f>“O seer, go, flee away <f>ⓤ</f>to the land of Judah, and <f>ⓥ</f>eat bread there, and prophesy there,
Amos 7-13 but <f>ⓦ</f>never again prophesy at Bethel, for <f>ⓧ</f>it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.”
Amos 7-14 <pb/>Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, <f>ⓨ</f>“I was <f>[1]</f> no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but <f>ⓩ</f>I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs.
Amos 7-15 <f>ⓐ</f> But the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’
Amos 7-16 <f>ⓑ</f> Now therefore hear the word of the LORD. <pb/><t>“You say, <f>ⓒ</f>‘Do not prophesy against Israel, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>do not preach against the house of <f>ⓔ</f>Isaac.’ </t>
Amos 7-17 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Therefore thus says the LORD: <pb/><t>“‘Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, </t><t>and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, </t><t>and your land <f>ⓖ</f>shall be divided up with a measuring line; </t><t>you yourself shall die in an unclean land, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.’” </t>
