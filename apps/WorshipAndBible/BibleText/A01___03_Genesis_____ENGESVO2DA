Genesis 3-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. <pb/>He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You <f>[1]</f> shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?”
Genesis 3-2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,
Genesis 3-3 but God said, <f>ⓑ</f>‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”
Genesis 3-4 <f>ⓒ</f> But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die.
Genesis 3-5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
Genesis 3-6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, <f>[2]</f> she took of its fruit <f>ⓓ</f>and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, <f>ⓔ</f>and he ate.
Genesis 3-7 <f>ⓕ</f> Then the eyes of both were opened, <f>ⓖ</f>and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
Genesis 3-8 <pb/>And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool <f>[3]</f> of the day, and the man and his wife <f>ⓗ</f>hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
Genesis 3-9 But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” <f>[4]</f>
Genesis 3-10 And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, <f>ⓘ</f>because I was naked, and I hid myself.”
Genesis 3-11 He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”
Genesis 3-12 The man said, <f>ⓙ</f>“The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.”
Genesis 3-13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, <f>ⓚ</f>“The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
Genesis 3-14 <pb/>The LORD God said to the serpent, <pb/><t>“Because you have done this, </t><t>cursed are you above all livestock </t><t>and above all beasts of the field; </t><t>on your belly you shall go, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>dust you shall eat </t><t>all the days of your life.</t>
Genesis 3-15 <t>I will put enmity between you and the woman, </t><t>and between your offspring <f>[5]</f> and <f>ⓜ</f>her offspring; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>he shall bruise your head, </t><t>and you shall bruise his heel.” </t>
Genesis 3-16 <pb/>To the woman he said, <pb/><t>“I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>in pain you shall bring forth children. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>Your desire shall be contrary to <f>[6]</f> your husband, </t><t>but he shall <f>ⓠ</f>rule over you.” </t>
Genesis 3-17 <pb/>And to Adam he said, <pb/><t>“Because you have listened to the voice of your wife </t><t>and have eaten of the tree </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>of which I commanded you, </t><t>‘You shall not eat of it,’ </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>cursed is the ground because of you; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;</t>
Genesis 3-18 <t>thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; </t><t>and you shall eat the plants of the field.</t>
Genesis 3-19 <t>By the sweat of your face </t><t>you shall eat bread, </t><t>till you return to the ground, </t><t>for out of it you were taken; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>for you are dust, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>to dust you shall return.” </t>
Genesis 3-20 <pb/>The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. <f>[7]</f>
Genesis 3-21 And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
Genesis 3-22 <pb/>Then the LORD God said, <f>ⓦ</f>“Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand <f>ⓧ</f>and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever — ”
Genesis 3-23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden <f>ⓨ</f>to work the ground from which he was taken.
Genesis 3-24 He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the <f>ⓩ</f>cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.
