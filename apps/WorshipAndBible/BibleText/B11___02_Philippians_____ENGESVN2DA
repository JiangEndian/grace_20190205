Philippians 2-1 <pb/>So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from <f>ⓐ</f>love, any <f>ⓑ</f>participation in the Spirit, any <f>ⓒ</f>affection and sympathy,
Philippians 2-2 <f>ⓓ</f> complete my joy by being <f>ⓔ</f>of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
Philippians 2-3 Do nothing from <f>ⓕ</f>selfish ambition or <f>ⓖ</f>conceit, but in <f>ⓗ</f>humility count others more significant than yourselves.
Philippians 2-4 Let each of you <f>ⓘ</f>look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
Philippians 2-5 <f>ⓙ</f> Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, <f>[1]</f>
Philippians 2-6 <f>ⓚ</f> who, though he was in <f>ⓛ</f>the form of God, did not count equality with God <f>ⓜ</f>a thing to be grasped, <f>[2]</f>
Philippians 2-7 but <f>ⓝ</f>emptied himself, by taking the form of a <f>ⓞ</f>servant, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>being born in the likeness of men.
Philippians 2-8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by <f>ⓠ</f>becoming obedient to the point of death, <f>ⓡ</f>even death on a cross.
Philippians 2-9 <f>ⓢ</f> Therefore <f>ⓣ</f>God has <f>ⓤ</f>highly exalted him and bestowed on him <f>ⓥ</f>the name that is above every name,
Philippians 2-10 so that at the name of Jesus <f>ⓦ</f>every knee should bow, <f>ⓧ</f>in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
Philippians 2-11 and <f>ⓨ</f>every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is <f>ⓩ</f>Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians 2-12 <pb/>Therefore, my beloved, <f>ⓐ</f>as you have always <f>ⓑ</f>obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
Philippians 2-13 for <f>ⓒ</f>it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for <f>ⓓ</f>his good pleasure.
Philippians 2-14 <pb/>Do all things <f>ⓔ</f>without grumbling or <f>ⓕ</f>disputing,
Philippians 2-15 that you may be blameless and innocent, <f>ⓖ</f>children of God <f>ⓗ</f>without blemish <f>ⓘ</f>in the midst of <f>ⓙ</f>a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine <f>ⓚ</f>as lights in the world,
Philippians 2-16 holding fast to <f>ⓛ</f>the word of life, so that in <f>ⓜ</f>the day of Christ <f>ⓝ</f>I may be proud that <f>ⓞ</f>I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
Philippians 2-17 Even if I am to be <f>ⓟ</f>poured out as a drink offering upon <f>ⓠ</f>the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.
Philippians 2-18 Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.
Philippians 2-19 <pb/>I hope in the Lord Jesus <f>ⓡ</f>to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you.
Philippians 2-20 For I have no one <f>ⓢ</f>like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.
Philippians 2-21 For they all <f>ⓣ</f>seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 2-22 But you know Timothy's <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>proven worth, how <f>ⓥ</f>as a son <f>[5]</f> with a father <f>ⓦ</f>he has served with me in the gospel.
Philippians 2-23 I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me,
Philippians 2-24 and <f>ⓧ</f>I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.
Philippians 2-25 <pb/>I have thought it necessary to send to you <f>ⓨ</f>Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and <f>ⓩ</f>fellow soldier, and your messenger and <f>ⓐ</f>minister to my need,
Philippians 2-26 for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.
Philippians 2-27 Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
Philippians 2-28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.
Philippians 2-29 So <f>ⓑ</f>receive him in the Lord with all joy, and <f>ⓒ</f>honor such men,
Philippians 2-30 for he nearly died <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>for the work of Christ, risking his life <f>ⓔ</f>to complete what was lacking in your service to me.
