Zechariah 7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is <f>ⓑ</f>Chislev.
Zechariah 7-2 Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men <f>ⓒ</f>to entreat the favor of the LORD,
Zechariah 7-3 <f>ⓓ</f> saying to the priests of the house of the LORD of hosts and <f>ⓔ</f>the prophets, “Should I weep and <f>ⓕ</f>abstain in <f>ⓖ</f>the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”
Zechariah 7-4 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me:
Zechariah 7-5 “Say to all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in <f>ⓗ</f>the fifth month and in <f>ⓘ</f>the seventh, for these <f>ⓙ</f>seventy years, <f>ⓚ</f>was it <f>ⓛ</f>for me that you fasted?
Zechariah 7-6 <f>ⓜ</f> And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?
Zechariah 7-7 <f>ⓝ</f> Were not these the words that the LORD proclaimed <f>ⓞ</f>by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, <f>ⓟ</f>with her cities around her, and the <f>ⓠ</f>South and the <f>ⓡ</f>lowland were inhabited?’”
Zechariah 7-8 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
Zechariah 7-9 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓢ</f>Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another,
Zechariah 7-10 <f>ⓣ</f> do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, <f>ⓤ</f>or the poor, and <f>ⓥ</f>let none of you devise evil against another in your heart.”
Zechariah 7-11 But <f>ⓦ</f>they refused to pay attention <f>ⓧ</f>and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear. <f>[1]</f>
Zechariah 7-12 <f>ⓨ</f> They made their hearts diamond-hard <f>ⓩ</f>lest they should hear the law and the words that the LORD of hosts had sent <f>ⓐ</f>by his Spirit through <f>ⓑ</f>the former prophets. <f>ⓒ</f>Therefore great anger came from the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah 7-13 <f>ⓓ</f> “As I <f>[2]</f> called, and they would not hear, <f>ⓔ</f>so they called, and I would not hear,” says the LORD of hosts,
Zechariah 7-14 <f>ⓕ</f> “and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all <f>ⓖ</f>the nations that they had not known. <f>ⓗ</f>Thus the land they left was desolate, <f>ⓘ</f>so that no one went to and fro, <f>ⓙ</f>and the pleasant land was made desolate.”
