Jeremiah 8-6 <t><f>ⓙ</f> I have paid attention and listened, </t><t>but they have not spoken rightly; </t><t>no man relents of his evil, </t><t>saying, ‘What have I done?’ </t><t>Everyone turns to his own course, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>like a horse plunging headlong into battle.</t>
Jeremiah 8-7 <t>Even the stork in the heavens </t><t>knows her times, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>the turtledove, <f>ⓜ</f>swallow, and crane <f>[1]</f> </t><t>keep the time of their coming, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>but my people know not </t><t>the rules <f>[2]</f> of the LORD. </t>

Jeremiah 8-17 <t>For behold, I am sending among you <f>ⓙ</f>serpents, </t><t>adders <f>ⓚ</f>that cannot be charmed, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>and they shall bite you,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
