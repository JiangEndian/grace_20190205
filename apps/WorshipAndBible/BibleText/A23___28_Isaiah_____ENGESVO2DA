Isaiah 28-1 <pb/><t>Ah, the proud crown of <f>ⓐ</f>the drunkards of Ephraim, </t><t>and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, </t><t>which is on the head of the rich valley of those overcome with wine!</t>
Isaiah 28-2 <t>Behold, the Lord has <f>ⓑ</f>one who is mighty and strong; </t><t>like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, </t><t>like <f>ⓒ</f>a storm of mighty, overflowing waters, </t><t>he casts down to the earth with his hand.</t>
Isaiah 28-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim </t><t>will be trodden underfoot;</t>
Isaiah 28-4 <t><f>ⓔ</f> and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, </t><t>which is on the head of the rich valley, </t><t>will be like <f>ⓕ</f>a first-ripe fig <f>[1]</f> before the summer: </t><t>when someone sees it, he swallows it </t><t>as soon as it is in his hand. </t>
Isaiah 28-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> In that day the LORD of hosts will be a crown of glory, <f>[2]</f> </t><t>and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people,</t>
Isaiah 28-6 <t>and <f>ⓗ</f>a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. </t>
Isaiah 28-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> These also reel with wine </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>stagger with strong drink; </t><t>the priest and <f>ⓛ</f>the prophet reel with strong drink, </t><t>they are swallowed by <f>[3]</f> wine, </t><t>they stagger with strong drink, </t><t>they reel in vision, </t><t>they stumble in giving judgment.</t>
Isaiah 28-8 <t>For all tables are full of filthy vomit, </t><t>with no space left. </t>
Isaiah 28-9 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> “To whom will he teach knowledge, </t><t>and to whom will he explain the message? </t><t>Those who are weaned from the milk, </t><t>those taken from the breast?</t>
Isaiah 28-10 <t>For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, </t><t>line upon line, line upon line, </t><t>here a little, there a little.” </t>
Isaiah 28-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> For by people of strange lips </t><t>and with a foreign tongue </t><t>the LORD will speak to this people,</t>
Isaiah 28-12 <t>to whom he has said, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>“This is rest; </t><t>give rest to the weary; </t><t>and this is repose”; </t><t>yet they would not hear.</t>
Isaiah 28-13 <t>And the word of the LORD will be to them </t><t>precept upon precept, precept upon precept, </t><t>line upon line, line upon line, </t><t>here a little, there a little, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>that they may go, and fall backward, </t><t>and be broken, and snared, and taken. </t>
Isaiah 28-14 <pb/><t>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you <f>ⓠ</f>scoffers, </t><t>who rule this people in Jerusalem!</t>
Isaiah 28-15 <t>Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death, </t><t>and with Sheol we have an agreement, </t><t>when the <f>ⓡ</f>overwhelming whip passes through </t><t>it will not come to us, </t><t>for we have made <f>ⓢ</f>lies our refuge, </t><t>and in falsehood we have taken shelter”;</t>
Isaiah 28-16 <t>therefore thus says the Lord GOD, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>“Behold, I am the one who has laid <f>[4]</f> as a foundation <f>ⓤ</f>in Zion, </t><t>a stone, a tested stone, </t><t>a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation: </t><t>‘Whoever believes will not be in haste.’</t>
Isaiah 28-17 <t>And I will make justice <f>ⓥ</f>the line, </t><t>and righteousness <f>ⓦ</f>the plumb line; </t><t>and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, </t><t>and waters will overwhelm the shelter.”</t>
Isaiah 28-18 <t>Then <f>ⓧ</f>your covenant with death will be annulled, </t><t>and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; </t><t>when the overwhelming scourge passes through, </t><t>you will be beaten down by it.</t>
Isaiah 28-19 <t>As often as it passes through it will take you; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>for morning by morning it will pass through, </t><t>by day and by night; </t><t>and it will be <f>ⓩ</f>sheer terror to understand the message.</t>
Isaiah 28-20 <t>For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on, </t><t>and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in.</t>
Isaiah 28-21 <t>For the LORD will rise up <f>ⓐ</f>as on Mount Perazim; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>as in the Valley of <f>ⓒ</f>Gibeon he will be roused; </t><t>to do his deed — strange is his deed! </t><t>and to work his work — alien is his work!</t>
Isaiah 28-22 <t>Now therefore do not <f>ⓓ</f>scoff, </t><t>lest your bonds be made strong; </t><t>for I have heard <f>ⓔ</f>a decree of destruction </t><t>from the Lord GOD of hosts against the whole land. </t>
Isaiah 28-23 <pb/><t>Give ear, and hear my voice; </t><t>give attention, and hear my speech.</t>
Isaiah 28-24 <t>Does he who plows for sowing plow continually? </t><t>Does he continually open and harrow his ground?</t>
Isaiah 28-25 <t><f>ⓕ</f> When he has leveled its surface, </t><t>does he not scatter dill, sow cumin, </t><t>and put in wheat in rows </t><t>and barley in its proper place, </t><t>and emmer <f>[5]</f> as the border?</t>
Isaiah 28-26 <t><f>ⓖ</f> For he is rightly instructed; </t><t>his God teaches him. </t>
Isaiah 28-27 <pb/><t>Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, </t><t>nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin, </t><t>but dill is beaten out with a stick, </t><t>and cumin with a rod.</t>
Isaiah 28-28 <t>Does one crush grain for bread? </t><t>No, he does not thresh it forever; <f>[6]</f> </t><t>when he drives his cart wheel over it </t><t>with his horses, he does not crush it.</t>
Isaiah 28-29 <t>This also comes from the LORD of hosts; </t><t>he is <f>ⓗ</f>wonderful in counsel </t><t>and excellent in wisdom. </t>
