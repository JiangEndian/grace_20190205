Jeremiah 14-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning <f>ⓐ</f>the drought:
Jeremiah 14-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> “Judah mourns, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>her gates languish; </t><t>her people lament on the ground, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>the cry of Jerusalem goes up.</t>
Jeremiah 14-3 <t>Her nobles send their servants for water; </t><t>they come to the cisterns; </t><t>they find no water; </t><t>they return with their vessels empty; </t><t>they are <f>ⓔ</f>ashamed and confounded </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>cover their heads.</t>
Jeremiah 14-4 <t>Because of the ground that is dismayed, </t><t>since there is <f>ⓖ</f>no rain on the land, </t><t>the farmers are ashamed; </t><t>they cover their heads.</t>
Jeremiah 14-5 <t>Even <f>ⓗ</f>the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn </t><t>because there is no grass.</t>
Jeremiah 14-6 <t><f>ⓘ</f> The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights; </t><t>they pant for air like jackals; </t><t>their eyes fail </t><t>because there is no vegetation. </t>
Jeremiah 14-7 <pb/><t>“Though our iniquities testify against us, </t><t>act, O LORD, <f>ⓙ</f>for your name's sake; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>for our backslidings are many; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>we have sinned against you.</t>
Jeremiah 14-8 <t><f>ⓜ</f> O you hope of Israel, </t><t>its savior in time of trouble, </t><t>why should you be like a stranger in the land, </t><t>like a traveler who turns aside to tarry for a night?</t>
Jeremiah 14-9 <t>Why should you be like a man confused, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>like a mighty warrior who cannot save? </t><t>Yet <f>ⓞ</f>you, O LORD, are in the midst of us, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>we are called by your name; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>do not leave us.” </t>
Jeremiah 14-10 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD concerning this people: </t><t>“They have loved to wander thus; </t><t>they have not restrained their feet; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>therefore the LORD does not accept them; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>now he will remember their iniquity </t><t>and punish their sins.” </t>
Jeremiah 14-11 <pb/>The LORD said to me: <f>ⓣ</f>“Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
Jeremiah 14-12 Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, <f>ⓤ</f>and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them <f>ⓥ</f>by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”
Jeremiah 14-13 <pb/>Then I said: “Ah, Lord GOD, behold, the prophets <f>ⓦ</f>say to them, ‘You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.’”
Jeremiah 14-14 And the LORD said to me: “The <f>ⓧ</f>prophets are prophesying lies in my name. <f>ⓨ</f>I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, <f>ⓩ</f>worthless divination, and <f>ⓐ</f>the deceit of their own minds.
Jeremiah 14-15 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although <f>ⓑ</f>I did not send them, and who say, <f>ⓒ</f>‘Sword and famine shall not come upon this land’: <f>ⓓ</f>By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.
Jeremiah 14-16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, <f>ⓔ</f>with none to bury them — them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their evil upon them.
Jeremiah 14-17 <pb/><t>“You shall say to them this word: </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, </t><t>and let them not cease, </t><t>for the virgin <f>ⓖ</f>daughter of my people is shattered with a great wound, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>with a very grievous blow.</t>
Jeremiah 14-18 <t><f>ⓘ</f> If I go out into the field, </t><t>behold, those pierced by the sword! </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>And if I enter the city, </t><t>behold, the diseases of famine! </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>For both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land </t><t>and have no knowledge.’” </t>
Jeremiah 14-19 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> Have you utterly rejected Judah? </t><t>Does your soul loathe Zion? </t><t>Why have you struck us down </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>so that there is no healing for us? </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>We looked for peace, but no good came; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>for a time of healing, but behold, terror.</t>
Jeremiah 14-20 <t><f>ⓟ</f> We acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD, </t><t>and the iniquity of our fathers, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>for we have sinned against you.</t>
Jeremiah 14-21 <t>Do not spurn us, <f>ⓡ</f>for your name's sake; </t><t>do not dishonor your glorious throne; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>remember and do not break your covenant with us.</t>
Jeremiah 14-22 <t>Are there any among <f>ⓣ</f>the false gods of the nations <f>ⓤ</f>that can bring rain? </t><t>Or can the heavens give showers? </t><t>Are you not he, O LORD our God? </t><t>We set our hope on you, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>for you do all these things. </t>
