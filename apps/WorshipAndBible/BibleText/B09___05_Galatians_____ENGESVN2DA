Galatians 5-1 <pb/>For <f>ⓐ</f>freedom Christ has <f>ⓑ</f>set us free; <f>ⓒ</f>stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to <f>ⓓ</f>a yoke of <f>ⓔ</f>slavery.
Galatians 5-2 <pb/>Look: I, Paul, say to you that <f>ⓕ</f>if you accept circumcision, <f>ⓖ</f>Christ will be of no advantage to you.
Galatians 5-3 I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that <f>ⓗ</f>he is obligated to keep the whole law.
Galatians 5-4 You are <f>ⓘ</f>severed from Christ, <f>ⓙ</f>you who would be justified <f>[1]</f> by the law; <f>ⓚ</f>you have fallen away from grace.
Galatians 5-5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly <f>ⓛ</f>wait for the hope of righteousness.
Galatians 5-6 For in Christ Jesus <f>ⓜ</f>neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but <f>ⓝ</f>only faith working through love.
Galatians 5-7 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying <f>ⓟ</f>the truth?
Galatians 5-8 This persuasion is not from <f>ⓠ</f>him who calls you.
Galatians 5-9 <f>ⓡ</f> A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
Galatians 5-10 <f>ⓢ</f> I have confidence in the Lord that you will <f>ⓣ</f>take no other view, and <f>ⓤ</f>the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is.
Galatians 5-11 But if I, brothers, <f>[2]</f> still preach <f>[3]</f> circumcision, <f>ⓥ</f>why am I still being persecuted? In that case <f>ⓦ</f>the offense of the cross has been removed.
Galatians 5-12 I wish <f>ⓧ</f>those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!
Galatians 5-13 <pb/>For you were called to freedom, brothers. <f>ⓨ</f>Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love <f>ⓩ</f>serve one another.
Galatians 5-14 For <f>ⓐ</f>the whole law is fulfilled in one word: <f>ⓑ</f>“You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
Galatians 5-15 But if you <f>ⓒ</f>bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
Galatians 5-16 <pb/>But I say, <f>ⓓ</f>walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify <f>ⓔ</f>the desires of the flesh.
Galatians 5-17 For <f>ⓕ</f>the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, <f>ⓖ</f>to keep you from doing the things you want to do.
Galatians 5-18 But if you are <f>ⓗ</f>led by the Spirit, <f>ⓘ</f>you are not under the law.
Galatians 5-19 Now <f>ⓙ</f>the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
Galatians 5-20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, <f>ⓚ</f>divisions,
Galatians 5-21 envy, <f>[4]</f> drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that <f>ⓛ</f>those who do <f>[5]</f> such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
Galatians 5-22 But <f>ⓜ</f>the fruit of the Spirit is <f>ⓝ</f>love, joy, peace, patience, <f>ⓞ</f>kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
Galatians 5-23 <f>ⓟ</f> gentleness, <f>ⓠ</f>self-control; <f>ⓡ</f>against such things there is no law.
Galatians 5-24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus <f>ⓢ</f>have crucified the flesh with its <f>ⓣ</f>passions and desires.
Galatians 5-25 <pb/>If we live by the Spirit, <f>ⓤ</f>let us also keep in step with the Spirit.
Galatians 5-26 <f>ⓥ</f> Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
