Acts 15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> But some men came down from Judea and were teaching <f>ⓑ</f>the brothers, “Unless you are <f>ⓒ</f>circumcised <f>ⓓ</f>according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”
Acts 15-2 And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and <f>ⓔ</f>debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and <f>ⓕ</f>some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to <f>ⓖ</f>the apostles and the elders about this question.
Acts 15-3 So, <f>ⓗ</f>being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, <f>ⓘ</f>describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and <f>ⓙ</f>brought great joy to all <f>ⓚ</f>the brothers. <f>[1]</f>
Acts 15-4 <f>ⓛ</f> When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and <f>ⓜ</f>the apostles and the elders, and <f>ⓝ</f>they declared all that God had done with them.
Acts 15-5 But some believers who belonged to <f>ⓞ</f>the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, <f>ⓟ</f>“It is necessary <f>ⓠ</f>to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.”
Acts 15-6 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> The <f>ⓢ</f>apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.
Acts 15-7 And after there had been much <f>ⓣ</f>debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, <f>ⓤ</f>that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear <f>ⓥ</f>the word of <f>ⓦ</f>the gospel and believe.
Acts 15-8 And God, <f>ⓧ</f>who knows the heart, <f>ⓨ</f>bore witness to them, <f>ⓩ</f>by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,
Acts 15-9 and <f>ⓐ</f>he made no distinction between us and them, <f>ⓑ</f>having cleansed their hearts <f>ⓒ</f>by faith.
Acts 15-10 Now, therefore, why <f>ⓓ</f>are you putting God to the test <f>ⓔ</f>by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples <f>ⓕ</f>that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
Acts 15-11 But we <f>ⓖ</f>believe that we will be <f>ⓗ</f>saved through <f>ⓘ</f>the grace of the Lord Jesus, <f>ⓙ</f>just as they will.”
Acts 15-12 <pb/>And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul <f>ⓚ</f>as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
Acts 15-13 After they finished speaking, <f>ⓛ</f>James replied, “Brothers, listen to me.
Acts 15-14 <f>ⓜ</f> Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them <f>ⓝ</f>a people for his name.
Acts 15-15 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,
Acts 15-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> “‘After this I will return, </t><t>and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; </t><t>I will rebuild its ruins, </t><t>and I will restore it,</t>
Acts 15-17 <t>that the remnant <f>[2]</f> of mankind <f>ⓟ</f>may seek the Lord, </t><t>and all the Gentiles <f>ⓠ</f>who are called by my name, </t><t>says the Lord, who makes these things </t>
Acts 15-18 <t><f>ⓡ</f> known from of old.’ </t>
Acts 15-19 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓢ</f>my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who <f>ⓣ</f>turn to God,
Acts 15-20 but should write to them <f>ⓤ</f>to abstain from <f>ⓥ</f>the things polluted by idols, and from <f>ⓦ</f>sexual immorality, and from <f>ⓧ</f>what has been strangled, and from <f>ⓨ</f>blood.
Acts 15-21 For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, <f>ⓩ</f>for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.”
Acts 15-22 <pb/>Then it seemed good to <f>ⓐ</f>the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called <f>ⓑ</f>Barsabbas, and <f>ⓒ</f>Silas, leading men among <f>ⓓ</f>the brothers,
Acts 15-23 with the following letter: <f>ⓔ</f>“The brothers, both <f>ⓕ</f>the apostles and the elders, to the brothers <f>[3]</f> who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, <f>ⓖ</f>greetings.
Acts 15-24 Since we have heard that <f>ⓗ</f>some persons have gone out from us and <f>ⓘ</f>troubled you <f>[4]</f> with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,
Acts 15-25 it has seemed good to us, having come <f>ⓙ</f>to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our <f>ⓚ</f>beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Acts 15-26 <f>ⓛ</f> men who have <f>ⓜ</f>risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts 15-27 We have therefore sent <f>ⓝ</f>Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.
Acts 15-28 For it has seemed good <f>ⓞ</f>to the Holy Spirit and <f>ⓟ</f>to us <f>ⓠ</f>to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements:
Acts 15-29 <f>ⓡ</f> that you abstain from <f>ⓢ</f>what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.”
Acts 15-30 <pb/>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
Acts 15-31 And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
Acts 15-32 And Judas and Silas, who were themselves <f>ⓣ</f>prophets, encouraged and <f>ⓤ</f>strengthened <f>ⓥ</f>the brothers with many words.
Acts 15-33 And after they had spent some time, they were sent off <f>ⓦ</f>in peace by <f>ⓧ</f>the brothers to those who had sent them. <f>[5]</f>
Acts 15-34 
Acts 15-35 But <f>ⓨ</f>Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
Acts 15-36 <pb/>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return and visit <f>ⓩ</f>the brothers <f>ⓐ</f>in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.”
Acts 15-37 Now Barnabas wanted to take with them <f>ⓑ</f>John called Mark.
Acts 15-38 But Paul thought best not to take with them one <f>ⓒ</f>who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
Acts 15-39 And there arose <f>ⓓ</f>a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. <f>ⓔ</f>Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,
Acts 15-40 but Paul chose Silas and departed, <f>ⓕ</f>having been commended by <f>ⓖ</f>the brothers to <f>ⓗ</f>the grace of the Lord.
Acts 15-41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, <f>ⓘ</f>strengthening the churches.
