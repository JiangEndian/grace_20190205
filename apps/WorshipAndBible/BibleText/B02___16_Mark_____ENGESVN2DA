Mark 16-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f>When the Sabbath was past, <f>ⓒ</f>Mary Magdalene, <f>ⓓ</f>Mary the mother of James, and <f>ⓔ</f>Salome <f>ⓕ</f>bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.
Mark 16-2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
Mark 16-3 And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away <f>ⓖ</f>the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
Mark 16-4 And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back — <f>ⓗ</f>it was very large.
Mark 16-5 And <f>ⓘ</f>entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, <f>ⓙ</f>dressed in <f>ⓚ</f>a white robe, and <f>ⓛ</f>they were alarmed.
Mark 16-6 And he said to them, <f>ⓜ</f>“Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.
Mark 16-7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that <f>ⓝ</f>he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, <f>ⓞ</f>just as he told you.”
Mark 16-8 And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
Mark 16-9 <pb/><n>[8]</n> [Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include 16:9–20.] <f>[1]</f> <pb/><e>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</e> </pb> <pb/>[[Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, <f>ⓟ</f>he appeared first to <f>ⓠ</f>Mary Magdalene, <f>ⓡ</f>from whom he had cast out seven demons.
Mark 16-10 <f>ⓢ</f> She went and told those who had been with him, <f>ⓣ</f>as they <f>ⓤ</f>mourned and wept.
Mark 16-11 But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they <f>ⓥ</f>would not believe it.
Mark 16-12 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> After these things <f>ⓧ</f>he appeared in <f>ⓨ</f>another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.
Mark 16-13 <f>ⓩ</f> And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.
Mark 16-14 <pb/>Afterward <f>ⓐ</f>he appeared <f>ⓑ</f>to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked them for their <f>ⓒ</f>unbelief and <f>ⓓ</f>hardness of heart, because <f>ⓔ</f>they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.
Mark 16-15 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Go into all the world and <f>ⓖ</f>proclaim the gospel to <f>ⓗ</f>the whole creation.</J>
Mark 16-16 <J><f>ⓘ</f> Whoever believes and is <f>ⓙ</f>baptized <f>ⓚ</f>will be saved, but <f>ⓛ</f>whoever <f>ⓜ</f>does not believe will be condemned.</J>
Mark 16-17 <J>And <f>ⓝ</f>these signs will accompany those who believe: <f>ⓞ</f>in my name they will cast out demons; <f>ⓟ</f>they will speak in new tongues;</J>
Mark 16-18 <J><f>ⓠ</f> they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; <f>ⓡ</f>they will lay their hands <f>ⓢ</f>on the sick, and they will recover.”</J>
Mark 16-19 <pb/>So then the Lord Jesus, <f>ⓣ</f>after he had spoken to them, <f>ⓤ</f>was taken up into heaven and <f>ⓥ</f>sat down at the right hand of God.
Mark 16-20 And they went out and preached everywhere, while <f>ⓦ</f>the Lord worked with them and confirmed <f>ⓧ</f>the message <f>ⓨ</f>by accompanying signs.]]
