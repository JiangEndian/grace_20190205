Mark 7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes <f>ⓑ</f>who had come from Jerusalem,
Mark 7-2 they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were <f>ⓒ</f>defiled, that is, unwashed.
Mark 7-3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, <f>[1]</f> holding to <f>ⓓ</f>the tradition of <f>ⓔ</f>the elders,
Mark 7-4 and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. <f>[2]</f> And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as <f>ⓕ</f>the washing of <f>ⓖ</f>cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches. <f>[3]</f>)
Mark 7-5 And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not walk according to <f>ⓗ</f>the tradition of <f>ⓘ</f>the elders, <f>ⓙ</f>but eat with <f>ⓚ</f>defiled hands?”
Mark 7-6 And he said to them, <J>“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you <f>ⓛ</f>hypocrites, as it is written,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓜ</f>“‘This people honors me with their lips,</J> </t><t><J>but their heart is far from me;</J></t>
Mark 7-7 <t><J>in vain do they worship me,</J> </t><t><J>teaching as <f>ⓝ</f>doctrines the commandments of men.’</J> </t>
Mark 7-8 <pb/><J>You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.”</J>
Mark 7-9 <pb/>And he said to them, <J>“You have a fine way of <f>ⓞ</f>rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition!</J>
Mark 7-10 <J>For Moses said, <f>ⓟ</f>‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.’</J>
Mark 7-11 <J>But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban”’ (that is, given to God) <f>[4]</f> — </J>
Mark 7-12 <J>then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,</J>
Mark 7-13 <J>thus <f>ⓡ</f>making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do.”</J>
Mark 7-14 <pb/>And he called the people to him again and said to them, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“Hear me, all of you, and understand:</J>
Mark 7-15 <J><f>ⓣ</f> There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.” <f>[5]</f></J>
Mark 7-16 
Mark 7-17 And when he had entered <f>ⓤ</f>the house and left the people, <f>ⓥ</f>his disciples asked him about the parable.
Mark 7-18 And he said to them, <J>“Then <f>ⓦ</f>are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him,</J>
Mark 7-19 <J>since it enters not his heart <f>ⓧ</f>but his stomach, and is expelled?” <f>[6]</f></J> (<f>ⓨ</f>Thus he declared all foods clean.)
Mark 7-20 And he said, <J> <f>ⓩ</f>“What comes out of a person is what defiles him.</J>
Mark 7-21 <J>For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, <f>ⓐ</f>murder, adultery,</J>
Mark 7-22 <J>coveting, wickedness, deceit, <f>ⓑ</f>sensuality, <f>ⓒ</f>envy, <f>ⓓ</f>slander, <f>ⓔ</f>pride, <f>ⓕ</f>foolishness.</J>
Mark 7-23 <J><f>ⓖ</f> All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”</J>
Mark 7-24 <pb/>And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. <f>[7]</f> And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden.
Mark 7-25 But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet.
Mark 7-26 <f>ⓗ</f> Now the woman was a <f>ⓘ</f>Gentile, <f>ⓙ</f>a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
Mark 7-27 And he said to her, <J>“Let the children be <f>ⓚ</f>fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and <f>ⓛ</f>throw it to the dogs.”</J>
Mark 7-28 But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's <f>ⓜ</f>crumbs.”
Mark 7-29 And he said to her, <J>“For this statement you may <f>ⓝ</f>go your way; the demon has left your daughter.”</J>
Mark 7-30 And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.
Mark 7-31 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to <f>ⓟ</f>the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the <f>ⓠ</f>Decapolis.
Mark 7-32 And they brought to him <f>ⓡ</f>a man who was deaf and <f>ⓢ</f>had a speech impediment, and they begged him to <f>ⓣ</f>lay his hand on him.
Mark 7-33 And <f>ⓤ</f>taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and <f>ⓥ</f>after spitting touched his tongue.
Mark 7-34 And <f>ⓦ</f>looking up to heaven, <f>ⓧ</f>he sighed and said to him, <J>“Ephphatha,”</J> that is, <J>“Be opened.”</J>
Mark 7-35 <f>ⓨ</f> And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.
Mark 7-36 And <f>ⓩ</f>Jesus <f>[8]</f> charged them to tell no one. But <f>ⓐ</f>the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.
Mark 7-37 And they were <f>ⓑ</f>astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
