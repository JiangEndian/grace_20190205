1 Samuel 1-1 <pb/>There was a certain man of <f>ⓐ</f>Ramathaim-zophim of <f>ⓑ</f>the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, <f>ⓒ</f>an Ephrathite.
1 Samuel 1-2 He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1 Samuel 1-3 <pb/>Now this man used to go up <f>ⓓ</f>year by year from his city <f>ⓔ</f>to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts <f>ⓕ</f>at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD.
1 Samuel 1-4 On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, <f>ⓖ</f>he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.
1 Samuel 1-5 But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb. <f>[1]</f>
1 Samuel 1-6 And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.
1 Samuel 1-7 So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.
1 Samuel 1-8 And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? <f>ⓗ</f>Am I not more to you than ten sons?”
1 Samuel 1-9 <pb/>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of <f>ⓘ</f>the temple of the LORD.
1 Samuel 1-10 She was <f>ⓙ</f>deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly.
1 Samuel 1-11 And she <f>ⓚ</f>vowed a vow and said, “O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed <f>ⓛ</f>look on the affliction of your servant and <f>ⓜ</f>remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, <f>ⓝ</f>and no razor shall touch his head.”
1 Samuel 1-12 <pb/>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.
1 Samuel 1-13 Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.
1 Samuel 1-14 And Eli said to her, “How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you.”
1 Samuel 1-15 But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but <f>ⓞ</f>I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.
1 Samuel 1-16 Do not regard your servant as <f>ⓟ</f>a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.”
1 Samuel 1-17 Then Eli answered, <f>ⓠ</f>“Go in peace, and the God of Israel <f>ⓡ</f>grant your petition that you have made to him.”
1 Samuel 1-18 And she said, <f>ⓢ</f>“Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then the woman <f>ⓣ</f>went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.
1 Samuel 1-19 <pb/>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at <f>ⓤ</f>Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD <f>ⓥ</f>remembered her.
1 Samuel 1-20 And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, “I have asked for him from the LORD.” <f>[2]</f>
1 Samuel 1-21 <pb/>The man Elkanah and all his house <f>ⓦ</f>went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow.
1 Samuel 1-22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the LORD <f>ⓧ</f>and dwell there forever.”
1 Samuel 1-23 <f>ⓨ</f> Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; <f>ⓩ</f>only, may the LORD establish his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
1 Samuel 1-24 And when she had weaned him, <f>ⓐ</f>she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, <f>[3]</f> an ephah <f>[4]</f> of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to <f>ⓑ</f>the house of the LORD at Shiloh. And the child was young.
1 Samuel 1-25 Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.
1 Samuel 1-26 And she said, “Oh, my lord! <f>ⓒ</f>As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.
1 Samuel 1-27 For this child I prayed, <f>ⓓ</f>and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him.
1 Samuel 1-28 Therefore I have lent him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD.” <pb/><f>ⓔ</f>And he worshiped the LORD there.
