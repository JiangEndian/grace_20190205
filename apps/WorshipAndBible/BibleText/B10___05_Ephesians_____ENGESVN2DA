Ephesians 5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.
Ephesians 5-2 And <f>ⓑ</f>walk in love, <f>ⓒ</f>as Christ loved us and <f>ⓓ</f>gave himself up for us, a <f>ⓔ</f>fragrant <f>ⓕ</f>offering and sacrifice to God.
Ephesians 5-3 <pb/>But <f>ⓖ</f>sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness <f>ⓗ</f>must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.
Ephesians 5-4 Let there be <f>ⓘ</f>no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, <f>ⓙ</f>which are out of place, but instead <f>ⓚ</f>let there be thanksgiving.
Ephesians 5-5 For you may be sure of this, that <f>ⓛ</f>everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (<f>ⓜ</f>that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
Ephesians 5-6 <f>ⓝ</f> Let no one <f>ⓞ</f>deceive you with empty words, for because of these things <f>ⓟ</f>the wrath of God comes upon <f>ⓠ</f>the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians 5-7 Therefore <f>ⓡ</f>do not become partners with them;
Ephesians 5-8 for <f>ⓢ</f>at one time you were <f>ⓣ</f>darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. <f>ⓤ</f>Walk as children of light
Ephesians 5-9 (for <f>ⓥ</f>the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true),
Ephesians 5-10 and <f>ⓦ</f>try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
Ephesians 5-11 <f>ⓧ</f> Take no part in the <f>ⓨ</f>unfruitful <f>ⓩ</f>works of darkness, but instead <f>ⓐ</f>expose them.
Ephesians 5-12 For <f>ⓑ</f>it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret.
Ephesians 5-13 But when <f>ⓒ</f>anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible,
Ephesians 5-14 for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“Awake, O sleeper, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>arise from the dead, </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>Christ will shine on you.” </t>
Ephesians 5-15 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,
Ephesians 5-16 <f>ⓗ</f> making the best use of the time, because <f>ⓘ</f>the days are evil.
Ephesians 5-17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what <f>ⓙ</f>the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians 5-18 And <f>ⓚ</f>do not get drunk with wine, for that is <f>ⓛ</f>debauchery, but <f>ⓜ</f>be filled with the Spirit,
Ephesians 5-19 addressing one another in <f>ⓝ</f>psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart,
Ephesians 5-20 <f>ⓞ</f> giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father <f>ⓟ</f>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Ephesians 5-21 <f>ⓠ</f> submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
Ephesians 5-22 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Wives, <f>ⓢ</f>submit to your own husbands, <f>ⓣ</f>as to the Lord.
Ephesians 5-23 For <f>ⓤ</f>the husband is the head of the wife even as <f>ⓥ</f>Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is <f>ⓦ</f>himself its Savior.
Ephesians 5-24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit <f>ⓧ</f>in everything to their husbands.
Ephesians 5-25 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and <f>ⓩ</f>gave himself up for her,
Ephesians 5-26 that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by <f>ⓐ</f>the washing of water <f>ⓑ</f>with the word,
Ephesians 5-27 so <f>ⓒ</f>that he might present the church to himself in splendor, <f>ⓓ</f>without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. <f>[1]</f>
Ephesians 5-28 In the same way <f>ⓔ</f>husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
Ephesians 5-29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,
Ephesians 5-30 because <f>ⓕ</f>we are members of his body.
Ephesians 5-31 <f>ⓖ</f> “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and <f>ⓗ</f>the two shall become one flesh.”
Ephesians 5-32 This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.
Ephesians 5-33 However, <f>ⓘ</f>let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she <f>ⓙ</f>respects her husband.
