John 21-1 <pb/>After this Jesus <f>ⓐ</f>revealed himself <f>ⓑ</f>again to the disciples by <f>ⓒ</f>the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way.
John 21-2 Simon Peter, <f>ⓓ</f>Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of <f>ⓔ</f>Cana in Galilee, <f>ⓕ</f>the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
John 21-3 Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will go with you.” They went out and got into the boat, but <f>ⓖ</f>that night they caught nothing.
John 21-4 <pb/>Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples <f>ⓗ</f>did not know that it was Jesus.
John 21-5 <f>ⓘ</f> Jesus said to them, <J>“Children, do you have any fish?”</J> They answered him, “No.”
John 21-6 <f>ⓙ</f> He said to them, <J>“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”</J> So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish.
John 21-7 That disciple <f>ⓚ</f>whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, <f>ⓛ</f>he put on his outer garment, for he was <f>ⓜ</f>stripped for work, and <f>ⓝ</f>threw himself into the sea.
John 21-8 The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards <f>[1]</f> off.
John 21-9 <pb/>When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread.
John 21-10 Jesus said to them, <J>“Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”</J>
John 21-11 So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn.
John 21-12 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“Come and <f>ⓟ</f>have breakfast.”</J> Now <f>ⓠ</f>none of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.
John 21-13 Jesus came and <f>ⓡ</f>took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish.
John 21-14 <f>ⓢ</f> This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.
John 21-15 <pb/>When they had <f>ⓣ</f>finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“Simon, <f>ⓥ</f>son of John, <f>ⓦ</f>do you love me more than these?”</J> He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, <J>“Feed <f>ⓧ</f>my lambs.”</J>
John 21-16 He said to him a second time, <J>“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</J> He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, <J> <f>ⓨ</f>“Tend <f>ⓩ</f>my sheep.”</J>
John 21-17 He said to him the third time, <J>“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</J> Peter was grieved because he said to him <f>ⓐ</f>the third time, <J>“Do you love me?”</J> and he said to him, “Lord, <f>ⓑ</f>you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, <J>“Feed <f>ⓒ</f>my sheep.</J>
John 21-18 <J><f>ⓓ</f> Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, <f>ⓔ</f>you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.”</J>
John 21-19 (This he said to show <f>ⓕ</f>by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Follow me.”</J>
John 21-20 <pb/>Peter turned and saw <f>ⓗ</f>the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, <f>ⓘ</f>the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, “Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?”
John 21-21 When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”
John 21-22 Jesus said to him, <J>“If it is my will that he remain <f>ⓙ</f>until <f>ⓚ</f>I come, what is that to you? <f>ⓛ</f>You follow me!”</J>
John 21-23 So the saying spread abroad among <f>ⓜ</f>the brothers <f>[2]</f> that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, <J>“If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?”</J>
John 21-24 <pb/>This is the disciple <f>ⓝ</f>who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and <f>ⓞ</f>we know <f>ⓟ</f>that his testimony is true.
John 21-25 <pb/>Now <f>ⓠ</f>there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that <f>ⓡ</f>the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
