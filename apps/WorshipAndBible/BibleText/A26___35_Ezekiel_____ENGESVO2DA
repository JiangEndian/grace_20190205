Ezekiel 35-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 35-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>set your face <f>ⓒ</f>against <f>ⓓ</f>Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
Ezekiel 35-3 and say to it, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓔ</f>Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and <f>ⓕ</f>I will stretch out my hand against you, <f>ⓖ</f>and I will make you a desolation and a waste.
Ezekiel 35-4 <f>ⓗ</f> I will lay your cities waste, and you shall become a desolation, and you shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 35-5 Because <f>ⓘ</f>you cherished perpetual enmity and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword <f>ⓙ</f>at the time of their calamity, <f>ⓚ</f>at the time of their final punishment,
Ezekiel 35-6 therefore, <f>ⓛ</f>as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; <f>ⓜ</f>because you did not hate bloodshed, therefore blood shall pursue you.
Ezekiel 35-7 <f>ⓝ</f> I will make Mount Seir a waste <f>ⓞ</f>and a desolation, and I will cut off from it <f>ⓟ</f>all who come and go.
Ezekiel 35-8 And I will fill <f>ⓠ</f>its mountains with the slain. On your hills and in your valleys and in all <f>ⓡ</f>your ravines <f>ⓢ</f>those slain with the sword shall fall.
Ezekiel 35-9 <f>ⓣ</f> I will make you a perpetual desolation, and <f>ⓤ</f>your cities shall not be inhabited. Then <f>ⓥ</f>you will know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 35-10 <pb/>“Because you said, <f>ⓦ</f>‘These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and <f>ⓧ</f>we will take possession of them’ — although the <f>ⓨ</f>LORD was there —
Ezekiel 35-11 therefore, <f>ⓩ</f>as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will deal with you <f>ⓐ</f>according to the anger and <f>ⓑ</f>envy that you showed because of your hatred against them. And <f>ⓒ</f>I will make myself known among them, when I judge you.
Ezekiel 35-12 And you shall know that I am the LORD. <pb/><f>ⓓ</f>“I have heard all the revilings that you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, ‘They are laid desolate; <f>ⓔ</f>they are given us to devour.’
Ezekiel 35-13 And <f>ⓕ</f>you magnified yourselves against me <f>ⓖ</f>with your mouth, and multiplied your words against me; I heard it.
Ezekiel 35-14 Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓗ</f>While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
Ezekiel 35-15 As you <f>ⓘ</f>rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, <f>ⓙ</f>Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then <f>ⓚ</f>they will know that I am the LORD.
