Ezekiel 22-1 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
Ezekiel 22-2 “And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>will you judge, will you judge <f>ⓒ</f>the bloody city? <f>ⓓ</f>Then declare to her all her abominations.
Ezekiel 22-3 You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in her midst, so that <f>ⓔ</f>her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself!
Ezekiel 22-4 You have become guilty <f>ⓕ</f>by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made, and you have brought <f>ⓖ</f>your days near, the appointed time of <f>[1]</f> your years has come. <f>ⓗ</f>Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all the countries.
Ezekiel 22-5 Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you; <f>ⓘ</f>your name is defiled; <f>ⓙ</f>you are full of tumult.
Ezekiel 22-6 <pb/>“Behold, <f>ⓚ</f>the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood.
Ezekiel 22-7 Father and mother <f>ⓛ</f>are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner <f>ⓜ</f>suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow <f>ⓝ</f>are wronged in you.
Ezekiel 22-8 <f>ⓞ</f> You have despised my holy things and <f>ⓟ</f>profaned my Sabbaths.
Ezekiel 22-9 <f>ⓠ</f> There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and people in you <f>ⓡ</f>who eat on the mountains; <f>ⓢ</f>they commit lewdness in your midst.
Ezekiel 22-10 In you <f>ⓣ</f>men uncover their fathers' nakedness; in you they violate women who are unclean in their menstrual impurity.
Ezekiel 22-11 <f>ⓤ</f> One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; <f>ⓥ</f>another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; <f>ⓦ</f>another in you violates his sister, his father's daughter.
Ezekiel 22-12 In you <f>ⓧ</f>they take bribes to shed blood; <f>ⓨ</f>you take interest and profit <f>[2]</f> and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; but <f>ⓩ</f>me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 22-13 <pb/>“Behold, <f>ⓐ</f>I strike my hand at <f>ⓑ</f>the dishonest gain that you have made, and at <f>ⓒ</f>the blood that has been in your midst.
Ezekiel 22-14 <f>ⓓ</f> Can your courage endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? <f>ⓔ</f>I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.
Ezekiel 22-15 <f>ⓕ</f> I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, and <f>ⓖ</f>I will consume your uncleanness out of you.
Ezekiel 22-16 And <f>ⓗ</f>you shall be profaned by your own doing <f>ⓘ</f>in the sight of the nations, <f>ⓙ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.”
Ezekiel 22-17 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 22-18 <f>ⓚ</f> “Son of man, the house of Israel has become <f>ⓛ</f>dross to me; all of them are <f>ⓜ</f>bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace; they are <f>ⓝ</f>dross of silver.
Ezekiel 22-19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel 22-20 As one gathers silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into a furnace, <f>ⓞ</f>to blow the fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you <f>ⓟ</f>in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you in and melt you.
Ezekiel 22-21 I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it.
Ezekiel 22-22 As silver is melted in a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD; <f>ⓠ</f>I have poured out my wrath upon you.”
Ezekiel 22-23 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 22-24 “Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is <f>ⓡ</f>not cleansed <f>ⓢ</f>or rained upon in the day of indignation.
Ezekiel 22-25 <f>ⓣ</f> The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is <f>ⓤ</f>like a roaring lion <f>ⓥ</f>tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.
Ezekiel 22-26 <f>ⓦ</f> Her priests <f>ⓧ</f>have done violence to my law and <f>ⓨ</f>have profaned my holy things. <f>ⓩ</f>They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and <f>ⓐ</f>they have disregarded my Sabbaths, <f>ⓑ</f>so that I am profaned among them.
Ezekiel 22-27 <f>ⓒ</f> Her princes in her midst are like wolves <f>ⓓ</f>tearing the prey, <f>ⓔ</f>shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain.
Ezekiel 22-28 And <f>ⓕ</f>her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, <f>ⓖ</f>seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ when the LORD has not spoken.
Ezekiel 22-29 The people of the land <f>ⓗ</f>have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and <f>ⓘ</f>have extorted from the sojourner without justice.
Ezekiel 22-30 <f>ⓙ</f> And I sought for a man among them <f>ⓚ</f>who should build up the wall <f>ⓛ</f>and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none.
Ezekiel 22-31 Therefore <f>ⓜ</f>I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned <f>ⓝ</f>their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.”
