Ezekiel 18-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 18-2 “What do you <f>[1]</f> mean <f>ⓐ</f>by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, <f>ⓑ</f>‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge’?
Ezekiel 18-3 <f>ⓒ</f> As I live, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓓ</f>this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel.
Ezekiel 18-4 Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: <f>ⓔ</f>the soul who sins shall die.
Ezekiel 18-5 <pb/>“If a man is righteous and does <f>ⓕ</f>what is just and right —
Ezekiel 18-6 if he <f>ⓖ</f>does not eat upon the mountains or <f>ⓗ</f>lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, <f>ⓘ</f>does not defile his neighbor's wife <f>ⓙ</f>or approach <f>ⓚ</f>a woman in her time of menstrual impurity,
Ezekiel 18-7 <f>ⓛ</f> does not oppress anyone, but <f>ⓜ</f>restores to the debtor his pledge, <f>ⓝ</f>commits no robbery, <f>ⓞ</f>gives his bread to the hungry <f>ⓟ</f>and covers the naked with a garment,
Ezekiel 18-8 <f>ⓠ</f> does not lend at interest <f>ⓡ</f>or take any profit, <f>[2]</f> withholds his hand from injustice, <f>ⓢ</f>executes true justice between man and man,
Ezekiel 18-9 <f>ⓣ</f> walks in my statutes, and keeps my rules by acting faithfully — he is righteous; <f>ⓤ</f>he shall surely live, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 18-10 <pb/>“If he fathers a son who is violent, <f>ⓥ</f>a shedder of blood, who does any of these things
Ezekiel 18-11 (though he himself did none of these things), <f>ⓦ</f>who even eats upon the mountains, <f>ⓧ</f>defiles his neighbor's wife,
Ezekiel 18-12 oppresses the poor and needy, <f>ⓨ</f>commits robbery, <f>ⓩ</f>does not restore the pledge, <f>ⓐ</f>lifts up his eyes to the idols, <f>ⓑ</f>commits abomination,
Ezekiel 18-13 <f>ⓒ</f> lends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; <f>ⓓ</f>his blood shall be upon himself.
Ezekiel 18-14 <pb/>“Now suppose this man fathers a son who sees all the sins that his father has done; he sees, and does not do likewise:
Ezekiel 18-15 he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,
Ezekiel 18-16 does not oppress anyone, <f>ⓔ</f>exacts no pledge, <f>ⓕ</f>commits no robbery, <f>ⓖ</f>but gives his bread to the hungry <f>ⓗ</f>and covers the naked with a garment,
Ezekiel 18-17 withholds his hand from iniquity, <f>[3]</f> takes no interest or profit, obeys my rules, <f>ⓘ</f>and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; <f>ⓙ</f>he shall surely live.
Ezekiel 18-18 As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, <f>ⓚ</f>behold, he shall die for his iniquity.
Ezekiel 18-19 <pb/>“Yet you say, <f>ⓛ</f>‘Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done <f>ⓜ</f>what is just and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, <f>ⓝ</f>he shall surely live.
Ezekiel 18-20 <f>ⓞ</f> The soul who sins shall die. <f>ⓟ</f>The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. <f>ⓠ</f>The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, <f>ⓡ</f>and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.
Ezekiel 18-21 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does <f>ⓣ</f>what is just and right, <f>ⓤ</f>he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel 18-22 <f>ⓥ</f> None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done he shall live.
Ezekiel 18-23 <f>ⓦ</f> Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?
Ezekiel 18-24 <f>ⓧ</f> But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice and does the same abominations that the wicked person does, shall he live? <f>ⓨ</f>None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered; for <f>ⓩ</f>the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, for them he shall die.
Ezekiel 18-25 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
Ezekiel 18-26 <f>ⓑ</f> When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does injustice, he shall die for it; for the injustice that he has done he shall die.
Ezekiel 18-27 Again, <f>ⓒ</f>when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he shall save his life.
Ezekiel 18-28 Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions that he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
Ezekiel 18-29 Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?
Ezekiel 18-30 <pb/>“Therefore <f>ⓓ</f>I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. <f>ⓔ</f>Repent and turn from all your transgressions, <f>ⓕ</f>lest iniquity be your ruin. <f>[4]</f>
Ezekiel 18-31 <f>ⓖ</f> Cast away from you all the transgressions that you have committed, and <f>ⓗ</f>make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! <f>ⓘ</f>Why will you die, O house of Israel?
Ezekiel 18-32 <f>ⓙ</f> For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord GOD; <f>ⓚ</f>so turn, and live.”
