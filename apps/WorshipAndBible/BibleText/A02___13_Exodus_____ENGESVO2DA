Exodus 13-3 <pb/>Then Moses said to the people, <f>ⓑ</f>“Remember this day in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery, <f>ⓒ</f>for by a strong hand the LORD brought you out from this place. <f>ⓓ</f>No leavened bread shall be eaten.
Exodus 13-4 Today, in the month of <f>ⓔ</f>Abib, you are going out.
Exodus 13-5 And when the LORD brings you into <f>ⓕ</f>the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which <f>ⓖ</f>he swore to your fathers to give you, a land <f>ⓗ</f>flowing with milk and honey, <f>ⓘ</f>you shall keep this service in this month.
Exodus 13-6 <f>ⓙ</f> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
Exodus 13-7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, and no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory.
Exodus 13-8 <f>ⓚ</f> You shall tell your son on that day, ‘It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’
Exodus 13-9 And it shall <f>ⓛ</f>be to you as a sign on your hand and as <f>ⓜ</f>a memorial <f>ⓝ</f>between your eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth. For with a strong hand the LORD has brought you out of Egypt.
Exodus 13-10 <f>ⓞ</f> You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
Exodus 13-11 <pb/>“When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, <f>ⓟ</f>as he swore to you and your fathers, and shall give it to you,
Exodus 13-12 <f>ⓠ</f> you shall set apart to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the firstborn of your animals that are males shall be the LORD's.
Exodus 13-13 <f>ⓡ</f> Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, or if you will not redeem it you shall break its neck. Every <f>ⓢ</f>firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem.
Exodus 13-14 <f>ⓣ</f> And when in time to come your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall say to him, <f>ⓤ</f>‘By a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of <f>ⓥ</f>slavery.
Exodus 13-15 For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the <f>ⓦ</f>LORD killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animals. Therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all the males that first open the womb, but <f>ⓧ</f>all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’
Exodus 13-16 <f>ⓨ</f> It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes, for <f>ⓩ</f>by a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”
Exodus 13-17 <pb/>When Pharaoh let the people go, God did <f>ⓐ</f>not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, “Lest the people <f>ⓑ</f>change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.”

Exodus 13-20 And <f>ⓔ</f>they moved on from Succoth and encamped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.

Exodus 13-22 The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
