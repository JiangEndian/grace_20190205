Acts 10-1 <pb/>At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of <f>ⓐ</f>what was known as the Italian Cohort,
Acts 10-2 a devout man <f>ⓑ</f>who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God.
Acts 10-3 <f>ⓒ</f> About the ninth hour of the day <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>he saw clearly in a vision <f>ⓔ</f>an angel of God come in and say to him, “Cornelius.”
Acts 10-4 And he stared at him in terror and said, “What is it, Lord?” And he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms <f>ⓕ</f>have ascended <f>ⓖ</f>as a memorial before God.
Acts 10-5 And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter.
Acts 10-6 He is lodging <f>ⓗ</f>with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
Acts 10-7 When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,
Acts 10-8 and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
Acts 10-9 <pb/>The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, <f>ⓘ</f>Peter went up <f>ⓙ</f>on the housetop about <f>ⓚ</f>the sixth hour <f>[2]</f> to pray.
Acts 10-10 And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into <f>ⓛ</f>a trance
Acts 10-11 and saw <f>ⓜ</f>the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth.
Acts 10-12 In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.
Acts 10-13 And there came a voice to him: <J>“Rise, Peter; kill and eat.”</J>
Acts 10-14 But Peter said, “By no means, Lord; <f>ⓝ</f>for I have never eaten anything that is <f>ⓞ</f>common or <f>ⓟ</f>unclean.”
Acts 10-15 And the voice came to him again a second time, <J> <f>ⓠ</f>“What God has made clean, do not call common.”</J>
Acts 10-16 This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.
Acts 10-17 <pb/>Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what <f>ⓡ</f>the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, <f>ⓢ</f>the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate
Acts 10-18 and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.
Acts 10-19 And while Peter was pondering <f>ⓣ</f>the vision, <f>ⓤ</f>the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you.
Acts 10-20 Rise and go down and <f>ⓥ</f>accompany them without hesitation, <f>[3]</f> for I have sent them.”
Acts 10-21 And Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?”
Acts 10-22 And they said, “Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and <f>ⓦ</f>God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by <f>ⓧ</f>a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and <f>ⓨ</f>to hear what you have to say.”
Acts 10-23 So he invited them in to be his guests. <pb/>The next day he rose and went away with them, and <f>ⓩ</f>some of <f>ⓐ</f>the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
Acts 10-24 And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
Acts 10-25 When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and <f>ⓑ</f>fell down at his feet and <f>ⓒ</f>worshiped him.
Acts 10-26 But Peter lifted him up, saying, <f>ⓓ</f>“Stand up; I too am a man.”
Acts 10-27 And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered.
Acts 10-28 And he said to them, “You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew <f>ⓔ</f>to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but <f>ⓕ</f>God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.
Acts 10-29 So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.”
Acts 10-30 <pb/>And Cornelius said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at <f>ⓗ</f>the ninth hour, <f>[4]</f> and behold, <f>ⓘ</f>a man stood before me in bright clothing
Acts 10-31 and said, ‘Cornelius, <f>ⓙ</f>your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
Acts 10-32 Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.’
Acts 10-33 So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.”
Acts 10-34 <pb/>So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that <f>ⓚ</f>God <f>ⓛ</f>shows no partiality,
Acts 10-35 but <f>ⓜ</f>in every nation anyone who fears him and <f>ⓝ</f>does what is right is acceptable to him.
Acts 10-36 As for <f>ⓞ</f>the word that he sent to Israel, <f>ⓟ</f>preaching good news of <f>ⓠ</f>peace through Jesus Christ (<f>ⓡ</f>he is Lord of all),
Acts 10-37 you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, <f>ⓢ</f>beginning <f>ⓣ</f>from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:
Acts 10-38 how <f>ⓤ</f>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth <f>ⓥ</f>with the Holy Spirit and with <f>ⓦ</f>power. He went about doing good and healing all <f>ⓧ</f>who were oppressed by the devil, <f>ⓨ</f>for God was with him.
Acts 10-39 And <f>ⓩ</f>we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. <f>ⓐ</f>They put him to death by hanging him on a tree,
Acts 10-40 but <f>ⓑ</f>God raised him on <f>ⓒ</f>the third day and made him to <f>ⓓ</f>appear,
Acts 10-41 <f>ⓔ</f> not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as <f>ⓕ</f>witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
Acts 10-42 And <f>ⓖ</f>he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify <f>ⓗ</f>that he is the one appointed by God to be judge <f>ⓘ</f>of the living and the dead.
Acts 10-43 <f>ⓙ</f> To him <f>ⓚ</f>all the prophets bear witness that <f>ⓛ</f>everyone who believes in him receives <f>ⓜ</f>forgiveness of sins <f>ⓝ</f>through his name.”
Acts 10-44 <pb/>While Peter was still saying these things, <f>ⓞ</f>the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.
Acts 10-45 And the believers from among <f>ⓟ</f>the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because <f>ⓠ</f>the gift of the Holy Spirit <f>ⓡ</f>was poured out even on the Gentiles.
Acts 10-46 For they were hearing them <f>ⓢ</f>speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,
Acts 10-47 <f>ⓣ</f> “Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit <f>ⓤ</f>just as we have?”
Acts 10-48 And he <f>ⓥ</f>commanded them <f>ⓦ</f>to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.
