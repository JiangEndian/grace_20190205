Hebrews 6-1 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓐ</f>let us leave <f>ⓑ</f>the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance <f>ⓒ</f>from dead works and of faith toward God,
Hebrews 6-2 and of <f>ⓓ</f>instruction about washings, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>the laying on of hands, <f>ⓕ</f>the resurrection of the dead, and <f>ⓖ</f>eternal judgment.
Hebrews 6-3 And this we will do <f>ⓗ</f>if God permits.
Hebrews 6-4 For it is impossible, in the case of those <f>ⓘ</f>who have once been enlightened, who have tasted <f>ⓙ</f>the heavenly gift, and <f>ⓚ</f>have shared in the Holy Spirit,
Hebrews 6-5 and <f>ⓛ</f>have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,
Hebrews 6-6 and <f>ⓜ</f>then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since <f>ⓝ</f>they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.
Hebrews 6-7 For <f>ⓞ</f>land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.
Hebrews 6-8 But <f>ⓟ</f>if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, <f>ⓠ</f>and its end is to be burned.
Hebrews 6-9 <pb/>Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things — things that belong to salvation.
Hebrews 6-10 For <f>ⓡ</f>God is not unjust so as to overlook <f>ⓢ</f>your work and the love that you have shown for his name in <f>ⓣ</f>serving the saints, as you still do.
Hebrews 6-11 And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance <f>ⓤ</f>of hope until the end,
Hebrews 6-12 so that you may not be sluggish, but <f>ⓥ</f>imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
Hebrews 6-13 <pb/>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, <f>ⓦ</f>he swore by himself,
Hebrews 6-14 saying, <f>ⓧ</f>“Surely I will bless you and multiply you.”
Hebrews 6-15 And thus Abraham, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓨ</f>having patiently waited, obtained the promise.
Hebrews 6-16 For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes <f>ⓩ</f>an oath is final for confirmation.
Hebrews 6-17 So when God desired to show more convincingly to <f>ⓐ</f>the heirs of the promise <f>ⓑ</f>the unchangeable character of his purpose, <f>ⓒ</f>he guaranteed it with an oath,
Hebrews 6-18 so that by two unchangeable things, in which <f>ⓓ</f>it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope <f>ⓔ</f>set before us.
Hebrews 6-19 We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into <f>ⓕ</f>the inner place behind the curtain,
Hebrews 6-20 where Jesus has gone <f>ⓖ</f>as a forerunner on our behalf, <f>ⓗ</f>having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
