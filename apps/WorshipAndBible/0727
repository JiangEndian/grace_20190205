36-1 <pb/>The heads of the fathers' houses of the clan of the <f>ⓐ</f>people of Gilead the son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the clans of the people of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the chiefs, the heads of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel.
36-2 They said, <f>ⓑ</f>“The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the people of Israel, and <f>ⓒ</f>my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
36-3 But if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the people of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry. So it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
36-4 And when <f>ⓓ</f>the jubilee of the people of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry, and their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”
36-5 <pb/>And Moses commanded the people of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, “The tribe of the people of Joseph <f>ⓔ</f>is right.
36-6 This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: ‘Let them marry whom they think best, <f>ⓕ</f>only they shall marry within the clan of the tribe of their father.
36-7 The inheritance of the people of Israel shall not be transferred from one tribe to another, for every one of the people of Israel <f>ⓖ</f>shall hold on to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
36-8 And <f>ⓗ</f>every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Israel shall be wife to one of the clan of the tribe of her father, so that every one of the people of Israel may possess the inheritance of his fathers.
36-9 So no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another, for each of the tribes of the people of Israel shall hold on to its own inheritance.’”
36-10 <pb/>The daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD commanded Moses,
36-11 <f>ⓘ</f> for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to sons of their father's brothers.
36-12 They were married into the clans of the people of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father's clan.
36-13 <pb/>These are the commandments and the rules that the LORD commanded through Moses to the people of Israel <f>ⓙ</f>in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
40-1 <pb/><t>I <f>ⓐ</f>waited patiently for the LORD; </t><t>he inclined to me and <f>ⓑ</f>heard my cry.</t>
40-2 <t>He drew me up from <f>ⓒ</f>the pit of destruction, </t><t>out of <f>ⓓ</f>the miry bog, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>set my feet upon a rock, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>making my steps secure.</t>
40-3 <t>He put <f>ⓖ</f>a new song in my mouth, </t><t>a song of praise to our God. </t><t>Many will <f>ⓗ</f>see and fear, </t><t>and put their trust in the LORD. </t>
40-4 <pb/><t>Blessed is the man who <f>ⓘ</f>makes </t><t>the LORD his trust, </t><t>who does not turn to the proud, </t><t>to those who <f>ⓙ</f>go astray after a lie!</t>
40-5 <t>You have multiplied, O LORD my God, </t><t>your <f>ⓚ</f>wondrous deeds and your <f>ⓛ</f>thoughts toward us; </t><t>none can compare with you! </t><t>I will proclaim and tell of them, </t><t>yet they are <f>ⓜ</f>more than can be told. </t>
40-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, </t><t>but you have given me an open <f>ⓞ</f>ear. <f>[1]</f> </t><t>Burnt offering and sin offering </t><t>you have not required.</t>
40-7 <t>Then I said, “Behold, I have come; </t><t>in the scroll of the book it is written <f>ⓟ</f>of me:</t>
40-8 <t><f>ⓠ</f> I delight to do your will, O my God; </t><t>your law is <f>ⓡ</f>within my heart.” </t>
40-9 <pb/><t>I have told the glad news of deliverance <f>[2]</f> </t><t>in <f>ⓢ</f>the great congregation; </t><t>behold, I have not <f>ⓣ</f>restrained my lips, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>as you know, O LORD.</t>
40-10 <t>I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart; </t><t>I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; </t><t>I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness </t><t>from the great congregation. </t>
40-11 <pb/><t>As for you, O LORD, you will not restrain </t><t>your mercy from me; </t><t>your <f>ⓥ</f>steadfast love and your faithfulness will </t><t>ever preserve me!</t>
40-12 <t>For evils have <f>ⓦ</f>encompassed me </t><t>beyond number; </t><t>my <f>ⓧ</f>iniquities have overtaken me, </t><t>and I cannot <f>ⓨ</f>see; </t><t>they are <f>ⓩ</f>more than the hairs of my head; </t><t>my heart <f>ⓐ</f>fails me. </t>
40-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> Be pleased, O LORD, to <f>ⓒ</f>deliver me! </t><t>O LORD, <f>ⓓ</f>make haste to help me!</t>
40-14 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether </t><t>who seek to snatch away my life; </t><t>let those be <f>ⓕ</f>turned back and brought to dishonor </t><t>who delight in my hurt!</t>
40-15 <t>Let those be appalled because of their shame </t><t>who <f>ⓖ</f>say to me, “Aha, Aha!” </t>
40-16 <pb/><t>But may all who seek you </t><t>rejoice and be glad in you; </t><t>may those who love your salvation </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>say continually, “Great is the LORD!”</t>
40-17 <t>As for me, I am <f>ⓘ</f>poor and needy, </t><t>but <f>ⓙ</f>the Lord takes thought for me. </t><t>You are my help and my deliverer; </t><t>do not delay, O my God! </t>
4-1 <pb/><t>“Hear this word, <f>ⓐ</f>you cows of Bashan, </t><t>who are <f>ⓑ</f>on the mountain of Samaria, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>who oppress the poor, <f>ⓓ</f>who crush the needy, </t><t>who say to your husbands, ‘Bring, that we may drink!’</t>
4-2 <t><f>ⓔ</f> The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness </t><t>that, behold, the days are coming upon you, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>when they shall take you away with hooks, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>even the last of you with fishhooks.</t>
4-3 <t><f>ⓗ</f> And you shall go out through the breaches, </t><t>each one straight ahead; </t><t>and you shall be cast out into Harmon,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
4-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> “Come to Bethel, and transgress; </t><t>to <f>ⓙ</f>Gilgal, and multiply transgression; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>bring your <f>ⓛ</f>sacrifices every morning, </t><t>your tithes every three days;</t>
4-5 <t>offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of <f>ⓜ</f>that which is leavened, </t><t>and proclaim <f>ⓝ</f>freewill offerings, publish them; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>for so you love to do, O people of Israel!” <pb/>declares the Lord GOD. </t>
4-6 <pb/><t>“I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>lack of bread in all your places, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>yet you did not return to me,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
4-7 <pb/><t>“I also <f>ⓡ</f>withheld the rain from you </t><t>when there were yet three months to the harvest; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>I would send rain on one city, </t><t>and send no rain on another city; </t><t>one field would have rain, </t><t>and the field on which it did not rain would wither;</t>
4-8 <t>so two or three cities <f>ⓣ</f>would wander to another city </t><t>to drink water, and would not be satisfied; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>yet you did not return to me,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
4-9 <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f> “I struck you with blight and mildew; </t><t>your many gardens and your vineyards, </t><t>your fig trees and your olive trees <f>ⓦ</f>the locust devoured; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>yet you did not return to me,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
4-10 <pb/><t>“I sent among you a pestilence <f>ⓨ</f>after the manner of Egypt; </t><t>I killed your young men with the sword, </t><t>and <f>ⓩ</f>carried away your horses, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>I made the stench of your camp go up into your nostrils; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>yet you did not return to me,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
4-11 <pb/><t>“I overthrew some of you, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, </t><t>and you were <f>ⓓ</f>as a brand <f>[2]</f> plucked out of the burning; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>yet you did not return to me,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
4-12 <pb/><t>“Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel; </t><t>because I will do this to you, </t><t>prepare to meet your God, O Israel!” </t>
