Genesis 22-1 <pb/>After these things <f>ⓐ</f>God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”
Genesis 22-2 He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to <f>ⓑ</f>the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”
Genesis 22-3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
Genesis 22-4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.
Genesis 22-5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy <f>[1]</f> will go over there and worship and come again to you.”
Genesis 22-6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and <f>ⓒ</f>laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.
Genesis 22-7 And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
Genesis 22-8 Abraham said, <f>ⓓ</f>“God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together.
Genesis 22-9 <pb/>When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and <f>ⓔ</f>laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
Genesis 22-10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
Genesis 22-11 But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.”
Genesis 22-12 He said, <f>ⓕ</f>“Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for <f>ⓖ</f>now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”
Genesis 22-13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.
Genesis 22-14 So Abraham called the name of that place, <f>ⓗ</f>“The LORD will provide”; <f>[2]</f> as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.” <f>[3]</f>
Genesis 22-15 <pb/>And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven
Genesis 22-16 and said, <f>ⓘ</f>“By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
Genesis 22-17 I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring <f>ⓙ</f>as the stars of heaven and <f>ⓚ</f>as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess <f>ⓛ</f>the gate of his <f>[4]</f> enemies,
Genesis 22-18 and <f>ⓜ</f>in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, <f>ⓝ</f>because you have obeyed my voice.”
Genesis 22-19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to <f>ⓞ</f>Beersheba. And Abraham lived at <f>ⓟ</f>Beersheba.
Genesis 22-20 <pb/>Now after these things it was told to Abraham, “Behold, <f>ⓠ</f>Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
Genesis 22-21 <f>ⓡ</f> Uz his firstborn, <f>ⓢ</f>Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
Genesis 22-22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”
Genesis 22-23 (<f>ⓣ</f>Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
Genesis 22-24 Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
2 Chronicles 20-1 <pb/>After this <f>ⓐ</f>the Moabites and Ammonites, and with them some of the Meunites, <f>[1]</f> came against Jehoshaphat for battle.
2 Chronicles 20-2 Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, “A great multitude is coming against you from Edom, <f>[2]</f> from beyond the sea; and, behold, they are in <f>ⓑ</f>Hazazon-tamar” (that is, <f>ⓒ</f>Engedi).
2 Chronicles 20-3 Then Jehoshaphat was afraid and set his face <f>ⓓ</f>to seek the LORD, and <f>ⓔ</f>proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
2 Chronicles 20-4 And Judah assembled to seek help from the LORD; from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
2 Chronicles 20-5 <pb/>And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
2 Chronicles 20-6 and said, “O LORD, God of our fathers, are you not <f>ⓕ</f>God in heaven? You <f>ⓖ</f>rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. <f>ⓗ</f>In your hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand you.
2 Chronicles 20-7 Did you not, our God, <f>ⓘ</f>drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of <f>ⓙ</f>Abraham your friend?
2 Chronicles 20-8 And they have lived in it and have built for you in it a sanctuary for your name, saying,
2 Chronicles 20-9 <f>ⓚ</f> ‘If disaster comes upon us, the sword, judgment, <f>[3]</f> or pestilence, or famine, <f>ⓛ</f>we will stand before this house and before you — <f>ⓜ</f>for your name is in this house — and cry out to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’
2 Chronicles 20-10 And now behold, the men of <f>ⓝ</f>Ammon and Moab and <f>ⓞ</f>Mount Seir, whom <f>ⓟ</f>you would not let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, <f>ⓠ</f>and whom they avoided and did not destroy —
2 Chronicles 20-11 behold, they reward us <f>ⓡ</f>by coming to drive us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.
2 Chronicles 20-12 O our God, will you not <f>ⓢ</f>execute judgment on them? For we are powerless against this great horde that is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but <f>ⓣ</f>our eyes are on you.”
2 Chronicles 20-13 <pb/>Meanwhile all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
2 Chronicles 20-14 And <f>ⓤ</f>the Spirit of the LORD came <f>[4]</f> upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.
2 Chronicles 20-15 And he said, “Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: Thus says the LORD to you, <f>ⓥ</f>‘Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed at this great horde, <f>ⓦ</f>for the battle is not yours but God's.
2 Chronicles 20-16 Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they will come up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of <f>ⓧ</f>the valley, east of the wilderness of Jeruel.
2 Chronicles 20-17 <f>ⓨ</f> You will not need to fight in this battle. Stand firm, hold your position, and see the salvation of the LORD on your behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem.’ <f>ⓩ</f>Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, <f>ⓐ</f>and the LORD will be with you.”
2 Chronicles 20-18 <pb/>Then Jehoshaphat <f>ⓑ</f>bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.
2 Chronicles 20-19 And the Levites, of the <f>ⓒ</f>Kohathites and the <f>ⓓ</f>Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.
2 Chronicles 20-20 <pb/>And they rose early in the morning and went out into <f>ⓔ</f>the wilderness of Tekoa. And when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! <f>ⓕ</f>Believe in the LORD your God, and you will be established; believe his prophets, and you will succeed.”
2 Chronicles 20-21 And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to the LORD and praise him <f>ⓖ</f>in holy attire, as they went before the army, and say, <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f>“Give thanks to the LORD, </t><t>for his steadfast love endures forever.” </t>
2 Chronicles 20-22 <pb/>And when they began to sing and praise, the LORD set <f>ⓘ</f>an ambush against the men of <f>ⓙ</f>Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah, so that they were routed.
2 Chronicles 20-23 For the men of Ammon and Moab rose against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, devoting them to destruction, and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, <f>ⓚ</f>they all helped to destroy one another.
2 Chronicles 20-24 <pb/>When Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they looked toward the horde, and behold, there <f>[5]</f> were dead bodies lying on the ground; none had escaped.
2 Chronicles 20-25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their spoil, they found among them, in great numbers, goods, clothing, and precious things, which they took for themselves until they could carry no more. They were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.
2 Chronicles 20-26 On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, <f>[6]</f> for there they blessed the LORD. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Beracah to this day.
2 Chronicles 20-27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, <f>ⓛ</f>for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies.
2 Chronicles 20-28 They came to Jerusalem with harps and lyres and trumpets, to the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 20-29 <f>ⓜ</f> And the fear of God came on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles 20-30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, <f>ⓝ</f>for his God gave him rest all around.
2 Chronicles 20-31 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Thus Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
2 Chronicles 20-32 He walked in the way of Asa his father and did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 20-33 <f>ⓟ</f> The high places, however, were not taken away; <f>ⓠ</f>the people had not yet set their hearts upon the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 20-34 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, are written in the chronicles of <f>ⓡ</f>Jehu the son of Hanani, <f>ⓢ</f>which are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles 20-35 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted wickedly.
2 Chronicles 20-36 He joined him in building ships to go to <f>ⓤ</f>Tarshish, and they built the ships in Ezion-geber.
2 Chronicles 20-37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, <f>ⓥ</f>“Because you have joined with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made.” And the ships were wrecked and were not able to go to Tarshish.
Jeremiah 7-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 7-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you men of Judah who enter these gates to worship the LORD.
Jeremiah 7-3 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓑ</f>Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place.
Jeremiah 7-4 <f>ⓒ</f> Do not trust in these deceptive words: ‘This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.’
Jeremiah 7-5 <pb/>“For if you truly <f>ⓓ</f>amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly <f>ⓔ</f>execute justice one with another,
Jeremiah 7-6 if you <f>ⓕ</f>do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, <f>ⓖ</f>or shed innocent blood in this place, <f>ⓗ</f>and if you do not go after other gods to your own harm,
Jeremiah 7-7 <f>ⓘ</f> then I will let you dwell in this place, <f>ⓙ</f>in the land that I gave of old to your fathers forever.
Jeremiah 7-8 <pb/>“Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail.
Jeremiah 7-9 <f>ⓚ</f> Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, <f>ⓛ</f>swear falsely, <f>ⓜ</f>make offerings to Baal, <f>ⓝ</f>and go after other gods that you have not known,
Jeremiah 7-10 and then come and stand before me in this house, <f>ⓞ</f>which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered!’ — only to go on doing all these abominations?
Jeremiah 7-11 <f>ⓟ</f> Has this house, <f>ⓠ</f>which is called by my name, <f>ⓡ</f>become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 7-12 Go now to <f>ⓢ</f>my place that was in Shiloh, <f>ⓣ</f>where I made my name dwell at first, and <f>ⓤ</f>see what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel.
Jeremiah 7-13 And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and <f>ⓥ</f>when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and <f>ⓦ</f>when I called you, you did not answer,
Jeremiah 7-14 therefore I will do to <f>ⓧ</f>the house <f>ⓨ</f>that is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers, <f>ⓩ</f>as I did to Shiloh.
Jeremiah 7-15 <f>ⓐ</f> And I will cast you out of my sight, <f>ⓑ</f>as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of <f>ⓒ</f>Ephraim.
Jeremiah 7-16 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓓ</f>do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.
Jeremiah 7-17 Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah 7-18 The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, <f>ⓔ</f>and the women knead dough, to <f>ⓕ</f>make cakes for <f>ⓖ</f>the queen of heaven. And <f>ⓗ</f>they pour out drink offerings to other gods, <f>ⓘ</f>to provoke me to anger.
Jeremiah 7-19 <f>ⓙ</f> Is it I whom they provoke? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves, <f>ⓚ</f>to their own shame?
Jeremiah 7-20 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, <f>ⓛ</f>my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, upon man and beast, upon the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; <f>ⓜ</f>it will burn and not be quenched.”
Jeremiah 7-21 <pb/>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓝ</f>“Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.
Jeremiah 7-22 For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them <f>ⓞ</f>concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.
Jeremiah 7-23 But this command I gave them: <f>ⓟ</f>‘Obey my voice, and <f>ⓠ</f>I will be your God, and you shall be my people. <f>ⓡ</f>And walk in all the way that I command you, <f>ⓢ</f>that it may be well with you.’
Jeremiah 7-24 <f>ⓣ</f> But they did not obey or incline their ear, <f>ⓤ</f>but walked in their own counsels and <f>ⓥ</f>the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and <f>ⓦ</f>went backward and not forward.
Jeremiah 7-25 From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, <f>ⓧ</f>I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day.
Jeremiah 7-26 <f>ⓨ</f> Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, <f>ⓩ</f>but stiffened their neck. <f>ⓐ</f>They did worse than their fathers.
Jeremiah 7-27 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> “So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. <f>ⓒ</f>You shall call to them, but they will not answer you.
Jeremiah 7-28 And you shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, and did not accept discipline; <f>ⓓ</f>truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.
Jeremiah 7-29 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “‘Cut off your hair and cast it away; </t><t>raise a lamentation on <f>ⓕ</f>the bare heights, </t><t>for the LORD has rejected and forsaken </t><t>the generation of his wrath.’ </t>
Jeremiah 7-30 <pb/>“For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, declares the LORD. They have set <f>ⓖ</f>their detestable things in the house <f>ⓗ</f>that is called by my name, to <f>ⓘ</f>defile it.
Jeremiah 7-31 And they have built the high places of <f>ⓙ</f>Topheth, which is in <f>ⓚ</f>the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, <f>ⓛ</f>to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, <f>ⓜ</f>which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind.
Jeremiah 7-32 <f>ⓝ</f> Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no more be called <f>ⓞ</f>Topheth, or <f>ⓟ</f>the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; <f>ⓠ</f>for they will bury in Topheth, because there is no room elsewhere.
Jeremiah 7-33 <f>ⓡ</f> And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, <f>ⓢ</f>and none will frighten them away.
Jeremiah 7-34 <f>ⓣ</f> And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, <f>ⓤ</f>for the land shall become a waste.
2 Thessalonians 2-1 <pb/>Now concerning <f>ⓐ</f>the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our <f>ⓑ</f>being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, <f>[1]</f>
2 Thessalonians 2-2 not to be quickly shaken in mind or <f>ⓒ</f>alarmed, either <f>ⓓ</f>by a spirit or a <f>ⓔ</f>spoken word, or <f>ⓕ</f>a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that <f>ⓖ</f>the day of the Lord has come.
2 Thessalonians 2-3 <f>ⓗ</f> Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, <f>ⓘ</f>unless the rebellion comes first, and <f>ⓙ</f>the man of lawlessness <f>[2]</f> is revealed, <f>ⓚ</f>the son of destruction, <f>[3]</f>
2 Thessalonians 2-4 who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, <f>ⓛ</f>proclaiming himself to be God.
2 Thessalonians 2-5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?
2 Thessalonians 2-6 And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.
2 Thessalonians 2-7 For <f>ⓜ</f>the mystery of lawlessness <f>ⓝ</f>is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.
2 Thessalonians 2-8 And then <f>ⓞ</f>the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus <f>ⓟ</f>will kill with <f>ⓠ</f>the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by <f>ⓡ</f>the appearance of his coming.
2 Thessalonians 2-9 The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan <f>ⓢ</f>with all power and false signs and wonders,
2 Thessalonians 2-10 and with all wicked deception for <f>ⓣ</f>those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
2 Thessalonians 2-11 Therefore <f>ⓤ</f>God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe <f>ⓥ</f>what is false,
2 Thessalonians 2-12 in order that all may be condemned <f>ⓦ</f>who did not believe the truth but <f>ⓧ</f>had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians 2-13 <pb/>But <f>ⓨ</f>we ought always to give thanks to God for you, <f>ⓩ</f>brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you <f>ⓐ</f>as the firstfruits <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>to be saved, <f>ⓒ</f>through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.
2 Thessalonians 2-14 To this he called you through <f>ⓓ</f>our gospel, <f>ⓔ</f>so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians 2-15 So then, brothers, <f>ⓕ</f>stand firm and hold to <f>ⓖ</f>the traditions that you were taught by us, either <f>ⓗ</f>by our spoken word or by <f>ⓘ</f>our letter.
2 Thessalonians 2-16 <pb/>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, <f>ⓙ</f>who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good <f>ⓚ</f>hope through grace,
2 Thessalonians 2-17 comfort your hearts and <f>ⓛ</f>establish them in every good work and word.
