29-1 <pb/>“Now this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them, that they may serve me as priests. <f>ⓐ</f>Take one bull of the herd and two rams without blemish,
29-2 <f>ⓑ</f> and unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers smeared with oil. You shall make them of fine wheat flour.
29-3 You shall put them in one basket and bring them in the basket, and bring the bull and the two rams.
29-4 You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and <f>ⓒ</f>wash them with water.
29-5 Then <f>ⓓ</f>you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastpiece, and gird him with the <f>ⓔ</f>skillfully woven band of the ephod.
29-6 <f>ⓕ</f> And you shall set the turban on his head and put the holy crown on the turban.
29-7 You shall take <f>ⓖ</f>the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.
29-8 Then you <f>ⓗ</f>shall bring his sons and put coats on them,
29-9 and you shall gird Aaron and his sons with <f>ⓘ</f>sashes and bind caps on them. And <f>ⓙ</f>the priesthood shall be theirs by a statute forever. Thus you shall <f>ⓚ</f>ordain Aaron and his sons.
29-10 <pb/>“Then you shall bring the bull before the tent of meeting. <f>ⓛ</f>Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull.
29-11 Then you shall kill the bull before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting,
29-12 and <f>ⓜ</f>shall take part of the blood of the bull and put it on the <f>ⓝ</f>horns of the altar with your finger, and the rest of <f>[1]</f> the blood you shall pour out at the base of the altar.
29-13 And you shall take all <f>ⓞ</f>the fat that covers the entrails, and the long lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar.
29-14 But the flesh of the bull and its skin and its dung you shall burn with fire <f>ⓟ</f>outside the camp; <f>ⓠ</f>it is a sin offering.
29-15 <pb/>“Then <f>ⓡ</f>you shall take one of the rams, and <f>ⓢ</f>Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram,
29-16 and you shall kill the ram and shall take its blood and throw it against the sides of the altar.
29-17 Then you shall <f>ⓣ</f>cut the ram into pieces, and wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its pieces and its head,
29-18 and burn the whole ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the LORD. It is a <f>ⓤ</f>pleasing aroma, a food offering <f>[2]</f> to the LORD.
29-19 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> “You shall take the other ram, <f>ⓦ</f>and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram,
29-20 and you shall kill the ram and take part of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron and on the tips of the right ears of his sons, and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of their right feet, and throw the rest of the blood against the sides of the altar.
29-21 Then you shall take part of the blood that is on the altar, and of the <f>ⓧ</f>anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and his sons' garments with him. He and his garments shall be holy, and his sons and his sons' garments with him.
29-22 <pb/>“You shall also take the fat from the ram and the fat tail and the <f>ⓨ</f>fat that covers the entrails, and the long lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of <f>ⓩ</f>ordination),
29-23 and <f>ⓐ</f>one loaf of bread and one cake of bread made with oil, and one wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before the LORD.
29-24 You shall put all these on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons, and <f>ⓑ</f>wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.
29-25 Then <f>ⓒ</f>you shall take them from their hands and burn them on the altar on top of the burnt offering, as a <f>ⓓ</f>pleasing aroma before the LORD. It is a food offering to the LORD.
29-26 <pb/>“You shall take the <f>ⓔ</f>breast of the ram of Aaron's <f>ⓕ</f>ordination and <f>ⓖ</f>wave it for a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be your portion.
29-27 And you shall consecrate the <f>ⓗ</f>breast of the wave offering that is waved and the <f>ⓘ</f>thigh of the priests' portion that is contributed from the ram of <f>ⓙ</f>ordination, from what was Aaron's and his sons'.
29-28 It shall be for Aaron and his sons as a <f>ⓚ</f>perpetual due from the people of Israel, for it is a <f>ⓛ</f>contribution. It shall be a <f>ⓜ</f>contribution from the people of Israel from their peace offerings, their contribution to the LORD.
29-29 <pb/>“The holy garments of Aaron <f>ⓝ</f>shall be for his sons after him; they shall <f>ⓞ</f>be anointed in them and ordained in them.
29-30 The son who succeeds him as priest, who comes into the tent of meeting to minister in the Holy Place, shall wear them <f>ⓟ</f>seven days.
29-31 <pb/>“You shall take the ram of ordination and <f>ⓠ</f>boil its flesh in a holy place.
29-32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the <f>ⓡ</f>bread that is in the basket in the entrance of the tent of meeting.
29-33 <f>ⓢ</f> They shall eat those things with which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration, but an <f>ⓣ</f>outsider shall not eat of them, because they are holy.
29-34 And if any of the flesh for the ordination or of the bread remain until the morning, then you shall <f>ⓤ</f>burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
29-35 <pb/>“Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. Through <f>ⓥ</f>seven days shall you ordain them,
29-36 and every day you shall offer a <f>ⓦ</f>bull as a sin offering for atonement. Also you shall purify the altar, when you make atonement for it, and shall <f>ⓧ</f>anoint it to consecrate it.
29-37 Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it, and the <f>ⓨ</f>altar shall be most holy. <f>ⓩ</f>Whatever touches the altar shall become holy.
29-38 <pb/>“Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: <f>ⓐ</f>two lambs a year old <f>ⓑ</f>day by day regularly.
29-39 One lamb you shall offer <f>ⓒ</f>in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer <f>ⓓ</f>at twilight.
29-40 And with the first lamb a tenth measure <f>[3]</f> of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin <f>[4]</f> of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering.
29-41 The other lamb you shall offer <f>ⓔ</f>at twilight, and shall offer with it a grain offering and its drink offering, as <f>ⓕ</f>in the morning, for a <f>ⓖ</f>pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.
29-42 It shall be a <f>ⓗ</f>regular burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before the LORD, <f>ⓘ</f>where I will meet with you, to speak to you there.
29-43 There I will meet with the people of Israel, and it shall be <f>ⓙ</f>sanctified by my glory.
29-44 I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. <f>ⓚ</f>Aaron also and his sons I will consecrate to serve me as priests.
29-45 <f>ⓛ</f> I will dwell among the people of Israel and will be their God.
29-46 And they shall know that <f>ⓜ</f>I am the LORD their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt that I might dwell among them. I am the LORD their God.
8-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
8-2 <pb/><t>“How long will you say these things, </t><t>and the words of your mouth be a <f>ⓑ</f>great wind?</t>

8-13 <t>Such are the paths of all who <f>ⓜ</f>forget God; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>the hope of <f>ⓞ</f>the godless shall perish.</t>
8-14 <t>His confidence is severed, </t><t>and his trust is <f>ⓟ</f>a spider's web. <f>[1]</f></t>
8-15 <t>He leans against his <f>ⓠ</f>house, but it does not stand; </t><t>he lays hold of it, but it does not endure.</t>
8-16 <t>He is a lush plant before the sun, </t><t>and his <f>ⓡ</f>shoots spread over his garden.</t>
8-17 <t>His roots entwine the stone heap; </t><t>he looks upon a house of stones.</t>

7-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
7-2 “And you, <f>ⓐ</f>O son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: <f>ⓑ</f>An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land. <f>[1]</f>
7-3 Now <f>ⓒ</f>the end is upon you, and <f>ⓓ</f>I will send my anger upon you; <f>ⓔ</f>I will judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
7-4 <f>ⓕ</f> And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity, but <f>ⓖ</f>I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. <f>ⓗ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD.
7-5 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster <f>ⓘ</f>after disaster! <f>[2]</f> Behold, it comes.
7-6 <f>ⓙ</f> An end has come; the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes.
7-7 <f>ⓚ</f> Your doom <f>[3]</f> has come to you, O inhabitant of the land. <f>ⓛ</f>The time has come; the day is near, a day of tumult, and not <f>ⓜ</f>of joyful shouting on the mountains.
7-8 Now I will soon <f>ⓝ</f>pour out my wrath upon you, and <f>ⓞ</f>spend my anger against you, <f>ⓟ</f>and judge you according to your ways, and I will punish you for all your abominations.
7-9 <f>ⓠ</f> And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. <f>ⓡ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD, who strikes.
7-10 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! <f>ⓣ</f>Your doom has come; <f>ⓤ</f>the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.
7-11 <f>ⓥ</f> Violence has grown up into <f>ⓦ</f>a rod of wickedness. <f>ⓧ</f>None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them. <f>[4]</f>
7-12 <f>ⓨ</f> The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not <f>ⓩ</f>the buyer rejoice, nor <f>ⓐ</f>the seller mourn, <f>ⓑ</f>for wrath is upon all their multitude. <f>[5]</f>
7-13 For <f>ⓒ</f>the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. <f>ⓓ</f>For the vision concerns all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life. <f>[6]</f>
7-14 <pb/>“They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but none goes to battle, <f>ⓔ</f>for my wrath is upon all their multitude.
7-15 <f>ⓕ</f> The sword is without; pestilence and famine are within. <f>ⓖ</f>He who is in the field dies by the sword, <f>ⓗ</f>and him who is in the city famine and pestilence devour.
7-16 <f>ⓘ</f> And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like <f>ⓙ</f>doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each one over his iniquity.
7-17 <f>ⓚ</f> All hands are feeble, and all knees turn to water.
7-18 <f>ⓛ</f> They put on sackcloth, and <f>ⓜ</f>horror covers them. Shame is on all faces, and <f>ⓝ</f>baldness on all their heads.
7-19 They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing. <f>ⓞ</f>Their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD.

7-20 <f>ⓡ</f> His beautiful ornament they used for pride, and <f>ⓢ</f>they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it. Therefore <f>ⓣ</f>I make it an unclean thing to them.
7-21 And I will give it into the hands of <f>ⓤ</f>foreigners for prey, <f>ⓥ</f>and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, and <f>ⓦ</f>they shall profane it.
7-22 I will turn my face from them, and <f>ⓧ</f>they shall profane my treasured <f>[7]</f> place. Robbers shall enter <f>ⓨ</f>and profane it.
7-23 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> “Forge a chain! <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>For the land is full of bloody crimes <f>ⓑ</f>and the city is full of violence.
7-24 I will bring <f>ⓒ</f>the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses. <f>ⓓ</f>I will put an end to the pride of the strong, <f>ⓔ</f>and their holy places <f>[9]</f> shall be profaned.
7-25 <f>ⓕ</f> When anguish comes, <f>ⓖ</f>they will seek peace, but there shall be none.
7-26 <f>ⓗ</f> Disaster comes upon disaster; <f>ⓘ</f>rumor follows rumor. <f>ⓙ</f>They seek a vision from the prophet, while <f>ⓚ</f>the law <f>[10]</f> perishes from the priest and <f>ⓛ</f>counsel from the elders.
7-27 The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are paralyzed by terror. According to their way <f>ⓜ</f>I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, <f>ⓝ</f>and they shall know that I am the LORD.”
8-1 <pb/>When the Lamb opened <f>ⓐ</f>the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
8-2 Then I saw the seven angels <f>ⓑ</f>who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
8-3 And another angel came and stood <f>ⓒ</f>at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with <f>ⓓ</f>the prayers of all the saints on <f>ⓔ</f>the golden altar before the throne,
8-4 and <f>ⓕ</f>the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.
8-5 Then the angel took the censer and <f>ⓖ</f>filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and <f>ⓗ</f>there were peals of <f>ⓘ</f>thunder, rumblings, <f>[1]</f> flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
8-6 <pb/>Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
8-7 <pb/>The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed <f>ⓙ</f>hail and <f>ⓚ</f>fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a <f>ⓛ</f>third of the earth was burned up, and a third of <f>ⓜ</f>the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
8-8 <pb/>The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like <f>ⓝ</f>a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea <f>ⓞ</f>became blood.
8-9 A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of <f>ⓟ</f>the ships were destroyed.
8-10 <pb/>The third angel blew his trumpet, and <f>ⓠ</f>a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on <f>ⓡ</f>the springs of water.
8-11 The name of the star is Wormwood. <f>[2]</f> A third of the waters <f>ⓢ</f>became wormwood, and many people died from the water, <f>ⓣ</f>because it had been made bitter.
8-12 <pb/>The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of <f>ⓤ</f>the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night.
8-13 <pb/>Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, <f>ⓥ</f>“Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”
