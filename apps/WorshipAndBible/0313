17-1 <pb/>When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; <f>[1]</f> walk before me, and be <f>ⓐ</f>blameless,
17-2 that I may make my covenant between me and you, and <f>ⓑ</f>may multiply you greatly.”
17-3 Then Abram <f>ⓒ</f>fell on his face. And God said to him,
17-4 “Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be <f>ⓓ</f>the father of a multitude of nations.
17-5 No longer shall your name be called Abram, <f>[2]</f> but <f>ⓔ</f>your name shall be Abraham, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
17-6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make <f>ⓖ</f>you into nations, and <f>ⓗ</f>kings shall come from you.
17-7 And I will <f>ⓘ</f>establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, <f>ⓙ</f>to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
17-8 And <f>ⓚ</f>I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and <f>ⓛ</f>I will be their God.”
17-9 <pb/>And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
17-10 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
17-11 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a <f>ⓜ</f>sign of the covenant between me and you.
17-12 He who is <f>ⓝ</f>eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or <f>ⓞ</f>bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring,
17-13 both he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money, shall surely be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant.
17-14 Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”
17-15 <pb/>And God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah <f>[4]</f> shall be her name.
17-16 I will bless her, and moreover, I will <f>ⓟ</f>give <f>[5]</f> you a son by her. I will bless her, and <f>ⓠ</f>she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.”
17-17 Then Abraham <f>ⓡ</f>fell on his face <f>ⓢ</f>and laughed and said to himself, “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”
17-18 And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!”
17-19 God said, “No, but <f>ⓣ</f>Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name <f>ⓤ</f>Isaac. <f>[6]</f> I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him.
17-20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and <f>ⓥ</f>multiply him greatly. He <f>ⓦ</f>shall father twelve princes, and <f>ⓧ</f>I will make him into a great nation.
17-21 But <f>ⓨ</f>I will establish my covenant with Isaac, <f>ⓩ</f>whom Sarah shall bear to you at this time next year.”
17-22 <pb/>When he had finished talking with him, <f>ⓐ</f>God went up from Abraham.
17-23 Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all those born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him.
17-24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
17-25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
17-26 That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.
17-27 And all the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The Spirit of God came <f>[1]</f> upon Azariah the son of Oded,
15-2 and he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: <f>ⓑ</f>The LORD is with you while you are with him. <f>ⓒ</f>If you seek him, he will be found by you, <f>ⓓ</f>but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.
15-3 <f>ⓔ</f> For a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without law,
15-4 <f>ⓕ</f> but when in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.
15-5 In those times there was no peace <f>ⓖ</f>to him who went out or to him who came in, for great disturbances afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands.
15-6 They were broken in pieces. Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every sort of distress.
15-7 <f>ⓗ</f> But you, take courage! Do not let your hands be weak, <f>ⓘ</f>for your work shall be rewarded.”
15-8 <pb/>As soon as Asa heard these words, <f>ⓙ</f>the prophecy of Azariah the son of Oded, he took courage and put away the detestable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from <f>ⓚ</f>the cities that he had taken in <f>ⓛ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, and he repaired the altar of the LORD <f>ⓜ</f>that was in front of the vestibule of the house of the LORD. <f>[2]</f>
15-9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, <f>ⓝ</f>and those from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were residing with them, for great numbers had deserted to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
15-10 They were gathered at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
15-11 They sacrificed to the LORD on that day <f>ⓞ</f>from the spoil that they had brought 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep.
15-12 <f>ⓟ</f> And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul,
15-13 but that whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓠ</f>should be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.
15-14 They swore an oath to the LORD with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns.
15-15 And all Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and had sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them, <f>ⓡ</f>and the LORD gave them rest all around.
15-16 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> Even Maacah, <f>ⓣ</f>his mother, King Asa removed from being queen mother because she had made a detestable image <f>ⓤ</f>for Asherah. Asa cut down her image, <f>ⓥ</f>crushed it, and burned it at the brook Kidron.
15-17 <f>ⓦ</f> But the high places were not taken out of Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly true all his days.
15-18 And he brought into the house of God the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels.
15-19 And there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
2-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me, saying,
2-2 “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, <pb/><t>“I remember the devotion of <f>ⓐ</f>your youth, </t><t>your love <f>ⓑ</f>as a bride, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>how you followed me in the wilderness, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>in a land not sown.</t>
2-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Israel was holy to the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the firstfruits of his harvest. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>All who ate of it incurred guilt; </t><t>disaster came upon them, <pb/>declares the LORD.” </t>
2-4 <pb/>Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.
2-5 Thus says the LORD: <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f>“What wrong did your fathers find in me </t><t>that they went far from me, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>and went after <f>ⓙ</f>worthlessness, and became worthless?</t>
2-6 <t>They did not say, <f>ⓚ</f>‘Where is the LORD </t><t>who brought us up from the land of Egypt, </t><t>who led us <f>ⓛ</f>in the wilderness, </t><t>in a land of deserts and pits, </t><t>in a land of drought and deep darkness, </t><t>in a land that none passes through, </t><t>where no man dwells?’</t>
2-7 <t><f>ⓜ</f> And I brought you into a plentiful land </t><t>to enjoy its fruits and its good things. </t><t>But when you came in, <f>ⓝ</f>you defiled my land </t><t>and made my heritage an abomination.</t>
2-8 <t>The priests did not say, ‘Where is the LORD?’ </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Those who handle the law did not know me; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>the shepherds <f>[1]</f> transgressed against me; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>the prophets prophesied by Baal </t><t>and went after <f>ⓡ</f>things that do not profit. </t>
2-9 <pb/><t>“Therefore <f>ⓢ</f>I still contend with you, <pb/>declares the LORD, </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>with your children's children I will contend.</t>
2-10 <t>For cross to the coasts of <f>ⓤ</f>Cyprus and see, </t><t>or send to <f>ⓥ</f>Kedar and examine with care; </t><t>see if there has been such a thing.</t>
2-11 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Has a nation changed its gods, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>even though they are no gods? </t><t>But my people <f>ⓨ</f>have changed their glory </t><t>for <f>ⓩ</f>that which does not profit.</t>
2-12 <t>Be appalled, <f>ⓐ</f>O heavens, at this; </t><t>be shocked, be utterly desolate, <pb/>declares the LORD,</t>
2-13 <t>for my people have committed two evils: </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>they have forsaken <f>ⓒ</f>me, </t><t>the fountain of <f>ⓓ</f>living waters, </t><t>and hewed out cisterns for themselves, </t><t>broken cisterns that can hold no water. </t>
2-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? </t><t>Why then has he become a prey?</t>
2-15 <t><f>ⓕ</f> The lions have roared against him; </t><t>they have roared loudly. </t><t>They have made his land a waste; </t><t>his cities are in ruins, <f>ⓖ</f>without inhabitant.</t>
2-16 <t>Moreover, the men of <f>ⓗ</f>Memphis and <f>ⓘ</f>Tahpanhes </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>have shaved <f>[2]</f> the crown of your head.</t>
2-17 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Have you not brought this upon yourself </t><t>by forsaking the LORD your God, </t><t>when <f>ⓛ</f>he led you in the way?</t>
2-18 <t><f>ⓜ</f> And now what do you gain by going to Egypt </t><t>to drink the waters of <f>ⓝ</f>the Nile? </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Or what do you gain by going to Assyria </t><t>to drink the waters of <f>ⓟ</f>the Euphrates? <f>[3]</f></t>
2-19 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Your evil will chastise you, </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>your apostasy will reprove you. </t><t>Know and see that it is evil and <f>ⓢ</f>bitter </t><t>for <f>ⓣ</f>you to forsake the LORD your God; </t><t>the fear of me is not in you, <pb/>declares the Lord GOD of hosts. </t>
2-20 <pb/><t>“For long ago I <f>ⓤ</f>broke your yoke </t><t>and burst your bonds; </t><t>but you said, <f>ⓥ</f>‘I will not serve.’ </t><t>Yes, <f>ⓦ</f>on every high hill </t><t>and under every green tree </t><t>you bowed down <f>ⓧ</f>like a whore.</t>
2-21 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Yet I planted you a choice vine, </t><t>wholly of pure seed. </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>How then have you turned degenerate </t><t>and become a wild vine?</t>
2-22 <t>Though you wash yourself with lye </t><t>and use much soap, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>the stain of your guilt is still before me, <pb/>declares the Lord GOD.</t>
2-23 <t><f>ⓑ</f> How can you say, ‘I am not unclean, </t><t>I have not gone after the Baals’? </t><t>Look at your way <f>ⓒ</f>in the valley; </t><t>know what you have done — </t><t>a restless young camel running here and there,</t>
2-24 <t><f>ⓓ</f> a wild donkey used to the wilderness, </t><t>in her heat sniffing the wind! </t><t>Who can restrain her lust? </t><t>None who seek her need weary themselves; </t><t>in her month they will find her.</t>
2-25 <t>Keep <f>ⓔ</f>your feet from going unshod </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>your throat from thirst. </t><t>But you said, ‘It is hopeless, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>for I have loved foreigners, </t><t>and after them I will go.’ </t>
2-26 <pb/><t>“As a thief is shamed when caught, </t><t>so the house of Israel shall be shamed: </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>they, their kings, their officials, </t><t>their priests, and their prophets,</t>
2-27 <t>who say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’ </t><t>and to a stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ </t><t>For they have turned their back to me, </t><t>and not their face. </t><t>But <f>ⓘ</f>in the time of their trouble they say, </t><t>‘Arise and save us!’</t>
2-28 <t>But <f>ⓙ</f>where are your gods </t><t>that you made for yourself? </t><t>Let them arise, <f>ⓚ</f>if they can save you, </t><t>in your time of trouble; </t><t>for <f>ⓛ</f>as many as your cities </t><t>are your gods, O Judah. </t>
2-29 <pb/><t>“Why do you contend with me? </t><t>You have all transgressed against me, <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
2-30 <t>In vain have I <f>ⓜ</f>struck your children; </t><t>they took no correction; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>your own sword devoured your prophets </t><t>like a ravening lion.</t>
2-31 <t>And you, O generation, behold the word of the LORD. </t><t>Have I been a wilderness to Israel, </t><t>or a land of thick darkness? </t><t>Why then do my people say, ‘We are free, </t><t>we will come no more to you’?</t>
2-32 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Can a virgin forget her ornaments, </t><t>or a bride her attire? </t><t>Yet <f>ⓟ</f>my people have forgotten me </t><t>days without number. </t>
2-33 <pb/><t>“How well you direct your course </t><t>to seek love! </t><t>So that even to wicked women </t><t>you have taught your ways.</t>
2-34 <t>Also on your skirts is found </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>the lifeblood of the guiltless poor; </t><t>you did not find them <f>ⓡ</f>breaking in. </t><t>Yet in spite of all these things</t>
2-35 <t>you say, ‘I am innocent; </t><t>surely his anger has turned from me.’ </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>Behold, I will bring you to judgment </t><t>for <f>ⓣ</f>saying, ‘I have not sinned.’</t>

2-37 <t>From it too you will come away </t><t>with <f>ⓦ</f>your hands on your head, </t><t>for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, </t><t>and you will not prosper by them. </t>
2-1 <pb/>For you yourselves know, brothers, <f>[1]</f> that our <f>ⓐ</f>coming to you <f>ⓑ</f>was not in vain.
2-2 But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated <f>ⓒ</f>at Philippi, as you know, <f>ⓓ</f>we had boldness in our God <f>ⓔ</f>to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much <f>ⓕ</f>conflict.
2-3 For <f>ⓖ</f>our appeal does not spring from <f>ⓗ</f>error or <f>ⓘ</f>impurity or <f>ⓙ</f>any attempt to deceive,
2-4 but just as we have been approved by God <f>ⓚ</f>to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not <f>ⓛ</f>to please man, but to please God <f>ⓜ</f>who tests our hearts.
2-5 <f>ⓝ</f> For we never came with words of flattery, <f>[2]</f> as you know, nor with a pretext for greed — <f>ⓞ</f>God is witness.
2-6 <f>ⓟ</f> Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, <f>ⓠ</f>though we could have made <f>ⓡ</f>demands as <f>ⓢ</f>apostles of Christ.
2-7 But we were <f>ⓣ</f>gentle <f>[3]</f> among you, <f>ⓤ</f>like a nursing mother taking care of her own children.
2-8 So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God <f>ⓥ</f>but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.
2-9 <pb/>For you remember, brothers, <f>ⓦ</f>our labor and toil: we <f>ⓧ</f>worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.
2-10 You are witnesses, and <f>ⓨ</f>God also, <f>ⓩ</f>how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers.
2-11 For you know how, <f>ⓐ</f>like a father with his children,
2-12 we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and <f>ⓑ</f>charged <f>ⓒ</f>you to walk in a manner worthy of God, <f>ⓓ</f>who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
2-13 <pb/>And <f>ⓔ</f>we also thank God constantly <f>[4]</f> for this, that when you received <f>ⓕ</f>the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it <f>ⓖ</f>not as the word of men <f>[5]</f> but as what it really is, the word of God, <f>ⓗ</f>which is at work in you believers.
2-14 For you, brothers, <f>ⓘ</f>became imitators of <f>ⓙ</f>the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For <f>ⓚ</f>you suffered the same things from your own countrymen <f>ⓛ</f>as they did from the Jews, <f>[6]</f>
2-15 <f>ⓜ</f> who killed both the Lord Jesus and <f>ⓝ</f>the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and <f>ⓞ</f>oppose all mankind
2-16 <f>ⓟ</f> by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved — so as always <f>ⓠ</f>to fill up the measure of their sins. But <f>ⓡ</f>wrath has come upon them at last! <f>[7]</f>
2-17 <pb/>But since we were torn away from you, brothers, for a short time, <f>ⓢ</f>in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire <f>ⓣ</f>to see you face to face,
2-18 because we wanted to come to you — I, Paul, again and again — but Satan <f>ⓤ</f>hindered us.
2-19 For what is our hope or <f>ⓥ</f>joy or crown of boasting <f>ⓦ</f>before our Lord Jesus at his <f>ⓧ</f>coming? Is it not you?
2-20 For you are our glory and joy.
