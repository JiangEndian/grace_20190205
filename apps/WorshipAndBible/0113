10-1 <pb/>Now Ahab had seventy sons in <f>ⓐ</f>Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of the city, <f>[1]</f> to the elders, and to <f>ⓑ</f>the guardians of the sons <f>[2]</f> of Ahab, saying,
10-2 “Now then, as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and weapons,
10-3 select the best and fittest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne and fight for your master's house.”
10-4 But they were exceedingly afraid and said, “Behold, the two kings could not stand before him. How then can we stand?”
10-5 So he who was over the palace, and he who was over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, sent to Jehu, saying, <f>ⓒ</f>“We are your servants, and we will do all that you tell us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your eyes.”
10-6 Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time.” Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, <f>ⓓ</f>who were bringing them up.
10-7 And as soon as the letter came to them, they took the king's sons <f>ⓔ</f>and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.
10-8 When the messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king's sons,” he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.”
10-9 Then in the morning, when he went out, he stood and said to all the people, “You are innocent. <f>ⓕ</f>It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who struck down all these?
10-10 Know then that there shall <f>ⓖ</f>fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab, for the LORD has done <f>ⓗ</f>what he said by his servant Elijah.”
10-11 So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his great men and his close friends and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
10-12 <pb/>Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
10-13 Jehu met <f>ⓘ</f>the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, “Who are you?” And they answered, “We are the relatives of Ahaziah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother.”
10-14 He said, “Take them alive.” And they took them alive and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons, and he spared none of them.
10-15 <pb/>And when he departed from there, he met <f>ⓙ</f>Jehonadab the son of <f>ⓚ</f>Rechab coming to meet him. And he greeted him and said to him, “Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?” And Jehonadab answered, “It is.” Jehu said, <f>[3]</f> “If it is, <f>ⓛ</f>give me your hand.” So he gave him his hand. And Jehu took him up with him into the chariot.
10-16 And he said, “Come with me, and see <f>ⓜ</f>my zeal for the LORD.” So he <f>[4]</f> had him ride in his chariot.
10-17 And when he came to Samaria, <f>ⓝ</f>he struck down all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had wiped them out, according to the word of the LORD <f>ⓞ</f>that he spoke to Elijah.
10-18 <pb/>Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, <f>ⓟ</f>“Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.
10-19 Now therefore call to me all the <f>ⓠ</f>prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests. Let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal.
10-20 And Jehu ordered, <f>ⓡ</f>“Sanctify <f>ⓢ</f>a solemn assembly for Baal.” So <f>ⓣ</f>they proclaimed it.
10-21 And Jehu sent throughout all Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they entered <f>ⓤ</f>the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
10-22 He said to him who was in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out the vestments for them.
10-23 Then Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab, and he said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search, and see that there is no servant of the LORD here among you, but only the worshipers of Baal.”
10-24 Then they <f>[5]</f> went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. <pb/>Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and said, “The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape <f>ⓥ</f>shall forfeit his life.”
10-25 So as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the officers, <f>ⓦ</f>“Go in and strike them down; let not a man escape.” So when they put them to the sword, the guard and the officers cast them out and went into the inner room of the house of Baal,
10-26 and they brought out the <f>ⓧ</f>pillar that was in <f>ⓨ</f>the house of Baal and burned it.
10-27 And they demolished the <f>ⓩ</f>pillar of Baal, and demolished the house of Baal, and made it <f>ⓐ</f>a latrine to this day.
10-28 <pb/>Thus Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel.
10-29 But Jehu did not turn aside from <f>ⓑ</f>the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓒ</f>which he made Israel to sin — that is, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan.
10-30 And the LORD said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, <f>ⓓ</f>your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.”
10-31 But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. <f>ⓔ</f>He did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel to sin.
10-32 <pb/>In those days the LORD <f>ⓕ</f>began to cut off parts of Israel. <f>ⓖ</f>Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:
10-33 from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from <f>ⓗ</f>Aroer, which is by the Valley of the Arnon, that is, <f>ⓘ</f>Gilead and Bashan.
10-34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
10-35 So Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.
10-36 The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
9-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> But there will be no <f>ⓐ</f>gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he <f>ⓑ</f>brought into contempt the land of <f>ⓒ</f>Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he <f>ⓓ</f>has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. <f>[2]</f>
9-2 <pb/><t><f>[3]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>The people <f>ⓕ</f>who walked in darkness </t><t>have seen a great light; </t><t>those who dwelt in a land of <f>ⓖ</f>deep darkness, </t><t>on them has light shone.</t>
9-3 <t><f>ⓗ</f> You have multiplied the nation; </t><t>you have increased its joy; </t><t>they rejoice before you </t><t>as with <f>ⓘ</f>joy at the harvest, </t><t>as they <f>ⓙ</f>are glad <f>ⓚ</f>when they divide the spoil.</t>
9-4 <t><f>ⓛ</f> For the yoke of his burden, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and the staff for his shoulder, </t><t>the rod of his oppressor, </t><t>you have broken as <f>ⓝ</f>on the day of Midian.</t>
9-5 <t><f>ⓞ</f> For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult </t><t>and every garment rolled in blood </t><t>will be burned as fuel for the fire.</t>
9-6 <t><f>ⓟ</f> For to us a child is born, </t><t>to us <f>ⓠ</f>a son is given; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>and the government shall be <f>ⓢ</f>upon <f>[4]</f> his shoulder, </t><t>and his name shall be called <f>[5]</f> </t><t>Wonderful <f>ⓣ</f>Counselor, <f>ⓤ</f>Mighty God, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>Everlasting <f>ⓦ</f>Father, Prince of <f>ⓧ</f>Peace.</t>
9-7 <t>Of the increase of his government and of peace </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>there will be no end, </t><t>on the throne of David and over his kingdom, </t><t>to establish it and to uphold it </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>with justice and with righteousness </t><t>from this time forth and forevermore. </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this. </t>
9-8 <pb/><t>The Lord has sent a word against Jacob, </t><t>and it will fall on Israel;</t>
9-9 <t>and all the people will know, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, </t><t>who say in pride and in arrogance of heart:</t>
9-10 <t>“The bricks have fallen, </t><t>but we will build with dressed stones; </t><t>the sycamores have been cut down, </t><t>but we will put cedars in their place.”</t>
9-11 <t>But the LORD raises the adversaries of Rezin against him, </t><t>and stirs up his enemies.</t>
9-12 <t><f>ⓒ</f> The Syrians on the east and <f>ⓓ</f>the Philistines on the west </t><t>devour Israel with open mouth. </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>For all this his anger has not turned away, </t><t>and his hand is stretched out still. </t>
9-13 <pb/><t>The people <f>ⓕ</f>did not turn to him who struck them, </t><t>nor inquire of the LORD of hosts.</t>
9-14 <t>So the LORD cut off from Israel <f>ⓖ</f>head and tail, </t><t>palm branch and reed in one day — </t>
9-15 <t><f>ⓗ</f> the elder and honored man is the head, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>the prophet who teaches lies is the tail;</t>
9-16 <t>for those who guide this people have been leading them astray, </t><t>and those who are guided by them are swallowed up.</t>
9-17 <t>Therefore the Lord does not <f>ⓙ</f>rejoice over their young men, </t><t>and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows; </t><t>for everyone is <f>ⓚ</f>godless and an evildoer, </t><t>and every mouth speaks <f>ⓛ</f>folly. <f>[6]</f> </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>For all this his anger has not turned away, </t><t>and his hand is stretched out still. </t>
9-18 <pb/><t>For wickedness burns like <f>ⓝ</f>a fire; </t><t>it consumes briers and thorns; </t><t>it kindles the thickets of the forest, </t><t>and they roll upward in a column of smoke.</t>
9-19 <t>Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts </t><t>the land is scorched, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>the people are like fuel for the fire; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>no one spares another.</t>
9-20 <t><f>ⓠ</f> They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry, </t><t>and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>each devours the flesh of his own arm,</t>
9-21 <t>Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh; </t><t>together they are <f>ⓢ</f>against Judah. </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>For all this his anger has not turned away, </t><t>and his hand is stretched out still. </t>
7-1 <pb/>Or do you not know, brothers <f>[1]</f> — for I am speaking to those who know the law — that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives?
7-2 For <f>ⓐ</f>a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage. <f>[2]</f>
7-3 Accordingly, <f>ⓑ</f>she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.
7-4 <pb/>Likewise, my brothers, <f>ⓒ</f>you also have died <f>ⓓ</f>to the law <f>ⓔ</f>through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, <f>ⓕ</f>in order that we may bear fruit for God.
7-5 For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work <f>ⓖ</f>in our members <f>ⓗ</f>to bear fruit for death.
7-6 But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the <f>ⓘ</f>new way of <f>ⓙ</f>the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code. <f>[3]</f>
7-7 <pb/>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, <f>ⓚ</f>I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if <f>ⓛ</f>the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”
7-8 But sin, <f>ⓜ</f>seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. <f>ⓝ</f>For apart from the law, sin lies dead.
7-9 I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died.
7-10 The very commandment <f>ⓞ</f>that promised life proved to be death to me.
7-11 For sin, <f>ⓟ</f>seizing an opportunity through the commandment, <f>ⓠ</f>deceived me and through it killed me.
7-12 So <f>ⓡ</f>the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
7-13 <pb/>Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.
7-14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, <f>ⓢ</f>sold under sin.
7-15 For I do not understand my own actions. For <f>ⓣ</f>I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.
7-16 Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with <f>ⓤ</f>the law, that it is good.
7-17 So now <f>ⓥ</f>it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
7-18 For I know that nothing good dwells <f>ⓦ</f>in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.
7-19 <f>ⓧ</f> For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.
7-20 Now if I do what I do not want, <f>ⓨ</f>it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
7-21 <pb/>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.
7-22 For <f>ⓩ</f>I delight in the law of God, <f>ⓐ</f>in my inner being,
7-23 but I see in my members <f>ⓑ</f>another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
7-24 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from <f>ⓒ</f>this body of death?
7-25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.
