Genesis 38-1 <pb/>It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and <f>ⓐ</f>turned aside to a certain <f>ⓑ</f>Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
Genesis 38-2 There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was <f>ⓒ</f>Shua. He took her and went in to her,
Genesis 38-3 and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name <f>ⓓ</f>Er.
Genesis 38-4 She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name <f>ⓔ</f>Onan.
Genesis 38-5 Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name <f>ⓕ</f>Shelah. Judah <f>[1]</f> was in Chezib when she bore him.
Genesis 38-6 <pb/>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
Genesis 38-7 But Er, Judah's firstborn, <f>ⓖ</f>was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD put him to death.
Genesis 38-8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to <f>ⓗ</f>your brother's wife and <f>ⓘ</f>perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”
Genesis 38-9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his. So whenever he went in to his brother's wife he would waste the semen on the ground, so as not to give offspring to his brother.
Genesis 38-10 And what he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, and he put him to death also.
Genesis 38-11 Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, <f>ⓙ</f>“Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up” — for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and remained <f>ⓚ</f>in her father's house.
Genesis 38-12 <pb/>In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died. When Judah <f>ⓛ</f>was comforted, he went up to <f>ⓜ</f>Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
Genesis 38-13 And when Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,”
Genesis 38-14 she took off her widow's garments <f>ⓝ</f>and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to <f>ⓞ</f>Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that Shelah was grown up, <f>ⓟ</f>and she had not been given to him in marriage.
Genesis 38-15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
Genesis 38-16 He turned to her at the roadside and said, “Come, let me come in to you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
Genesis 38-17 He answered, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” And she said, “If you give me a pledge, until you send it — ”
Genesis 38-18 He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She replied, <f>ⓠ</f>“Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
Genesis 38-19 Then she arose and went away, and taking off <f>ⓡ</f>her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.
Genesis 38-20 <pb/>When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to take back the pledge from the woman's hand, he did not find her.
Genesis 38-21 And he asked the men of the place, “Where is the cult prostitute <f>[2]</f> who was at <f>ⓢ</f>Enaim at the roadside?” And they said, “No cult prostitute has been here.”
Genesis 38-22 So he returned to Judah and said, “I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said, ‘No cult prostitute has been here.’”
Genesis 38-23 And Judah replied, “Let her keep the things as her own, or we shall be laughed at. You see, I sent this young goat, and you did not find her.”
Genesis 38-24 <pb/>About three months later Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law <f>ⓣ</f>has been immoral. <f>[3]</f> Moreover, she is pregnant by immorality.” <f>[4]</f> And Judah said, “Bring her out, and <f>ⓤ</f>let her be burned.”
Genesis 38-25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, “By the man to whom these belong, I am pregnant.” And she said, “Please identify whose these are, <f>ⓥ</f>the signet and the cord and the staff.”
Genesis 38-26 Then Judah identified them and said, <f>ⓦ</f>“She is more righteous than I, since <f>ⓧ</f>I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not know her again.
Genesis 38-27 <pb/>When the time of her labor came, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis 38-28 And when she was in labor, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.”
Genesis 38-29 But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out. And she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” Therefore his name was called <f>ⓨ</f>Perez. <f>[5]</f>
Genesis 38-30 Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called <f>ⓩ</f>Zerah.
2 Chronicles 36-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and made him king in his father's place in Jerusalem.

2 Chronicles 36-8 <f>ⓗ</f> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and the abominations that he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 36-9 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Jehoiachin was eighteen <f>[2]</f> years old when he became king, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 36-10 In <f>ⓙ</f>the spring of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, <f>ⓚ</f>with the precious vessels of the house of the LORD, and made his brother <f>ⓛ</f>Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem.

2 Chronicles 36-12 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God. He did not humble himself before <f>ⓝ</f>Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 36-13 <f>ⓞ</f> He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. <f>ⓟ</f>He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 36-14 All the officers of the priests and the people likewise were exceedingly unfaithful, following all the abominations of the nations. And they polluted the house of the LORD that he had made holy in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36-15 <pb/>The LORD, the God of their fathers, <f>ⓠ</f>sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.
2 Chronicles 36-16 <f>ⓡ</f> But they kept mocking the messengers of God, <f>ⓢ</f>despising his words and scoffing at his prophets, <f>ⓣ</f>until the wrath of the LORD rose against his people, until there was no remedy.
2 Chronicles 36-17 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or aged. He gave them all into his hand.
2 Chronicles 36-18 <f>ⓥ</f> And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.
2 Chronicles 36-19 <f>ⓦ</f> And they burned the house of God and broke down the wall of Jerusalem and burned all its palaces with fire and destroyed all its precious vessels.
2 Chronicles 36-20 He <f>ⓧ</f>took into exile in Babylon those who had escaped from the sword, <f>ⓨ</f>and they became servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of Persia,
2 Chronicles 36-21 to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had <f>ⓩ</f>enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days that it lay desolate <f>ⓐ</f>it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
2 Chronicles 36-22 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, <f>ⓒ</f>that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, <f>ⓓ</f>the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:
2 Chronicles 36-23 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the LORD his God be with him. Let him go up.’”
Jeremiah 23-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 23-2 Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning <f>ⓑ</f>the shepherds who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. <f>ⓒ</f>Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 23-3 <f>ⓓ</f> Then I will gather the remnant of my flock <f>ⓔ</f>out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, <f>ⓕ</f>and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
Jeremiah 23-4 <f>ⓖ</f> I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 23-5 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous <f>ⓘ</f>Branch, and <f>ⓙ</f>he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah 23-6 In his days Judah will be saved, and <f>ⓚ</f>Israel will <f>ⓛ</f>dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: <f>ⓜ</f>‘The LORD is our righteousness.’
Jeremiah 23-7 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> “Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they shall no longer say, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’
Jeremiah 23-8 but ‘As the LORD lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he <f>[1]</f> had driven them.’ Then they shall dwell in their own land.”
Jeremiah 23-9 <pb/>Concerning the prophets: <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>My heart is broken within me; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>all my bones shake; </t><t>I am like a drunken man, </t><t>like a man overcome by wine, </t><t>because of the LORD </t><t>and because of his holy words.</t>
Jeremiah 23-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> For the land is full of adulterers; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>because of the curse <f>ⓢ</f>the land mourns, </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>Their course is evil, </t><t>and their might is not right.</t>

Jeremiah 23-12 <t><f>ⓧ</f> Therefore their way shall be to them </t><t>like slippery paths <f>ⓨ</f>in the darkness, </t><t>into which they shall be driven and fall, </t><t>for I will bring disaster upon them </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>in the year of their punishment, <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 23-13 <t>In the prophets of <f>ⓐ</f>Samaria </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>I saw an unsavory thing: </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>they prophesied by Baal </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>and led my people Israel astray.</t>
Jeremiah 23-14 <t>But in the prophets of Jerusalem </t><t>I have seen a horrible thing: </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>they commit adultery and walk in lies; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>they strengthen the hands of evildoers, </t><t>so that no one turns from his evil; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>all of them have become like Sodom to me, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”</t>
Jeremiah 23-15 <t>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets: </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>“Behold, I will feed them with bitter food </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>and give them <f>ⓚ</f>poisoned water to drink, </t><t>for from the prophets of Jerusalem </t><t>ungodliness has gone out into all the land.” </t>
Jeremiah 23-16 <pb/>Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, <f>ⓛ</f>filling you with vain hopes. <f>ⓜ</f>They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.
Jeremiah 23-17 They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>‘It shall be well with you’; and to everyone who <f>ⓞ</f>stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, <f>ⓟ</f>‘No disaster shall come upon you.’”
Jeremiah 23-18 <pb/><t>For <f>ⓠ</f>who among them has stood in the council of the LORD </t><t>to see and to hear his word, </t><t>or who has paid attention to his word and listened?</t>

Jeremiah 23-25 I have heard what the prophets have said <f>ⓓ</f>who prophesy lies in my name, saying, <f>ⓔ</f>‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’
Jeremiah 23-26 How long shall there be lies in the heart of <f>ⓕ</f>the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,
Jeremiah 23-27 who think to make my people forget my name <f>ⓖ</f>by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their <f>ⓗ</f>fathers forgot my name for Baal?
Jeremiah 23-28 <f>ⓘ</f> Let the prophet who has a dream <f>ⓙ</f>tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. <f>ⓚ</f>What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 23-29 <f>ⓛ</f> Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and <f>ⓜ</f>like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
Jeremiah 23-30 <f>ⓝ</f> Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another.
Jeremiah 23-31 Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, ‘declares the LORD.’

Jeremiah 23-33 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the LORD?’ you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓡ</f>I will cast you off, declares the LORD.’
Jeremiah 23-34 And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ <f>ⓢ</f>I will punish that man and his household.
Jeremiah 23-35 Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
Jeremiah 23-36 But ‘the burden of the LORD’ you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man's own word, and <f>ⓣ</f>you pervert the words of <f>ⓤ</f>the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
Jeremiah 23-37 Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’
Jeremiah 23-38 But if you say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have said these words, “The burden of the LORD,” when I sent to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’”
Jeremiah 23-39 therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up <f>[3]</f> and <f>ⓥ</f>cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers.

Hebrews 1-1 <pb/>Long ago, at many times and <f>ⓐ</f>in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,
Hebrews 1-2 but <f>ⓑ</f>in these last days <f>ⓒ</f>he has spoken to us by <f>ⓓ</f>his Son, whom he appointed <f>ⓔ</f>the heir of all things, <f>ⓕ</f>through whom also he created <f>ⓖ</f>the world.
Hebrews 1-3 He is the radiance of the glory of God and <f>ⓗ</f>the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. <f>ⓘ</f>After making purification for sins, <f>ⓙ</f>he sat down <f>ⓚ</f>at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
Hebrews 1-4 having become as much superior to angels as the name <f>ⓛ</f>he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
Hebrews 1-5 <pb/>For to which of the angels did God ever say, <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“You are my Son, </t><t>today I have begotten you”? </t> <pb/>Or again, <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“I will be to him a father, </t><t>and he shall be to me a son”? </t>
Hebrews 1-6 <pb/>And again, when he brings <f>ⓞ</f>the firstborn into the world, he says, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f>“Let all God's angels worship him.” </t>
Hebrews 1-7 <pb/>Of the angels he says, <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f>“He makes his angels winds, </t><t>and his ministers a flame of fire.” </t>
Hebrews 1-8 <pb/>But of the Son he says, <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f>“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, </t><t>the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.</t>
Hebrews 1-9 <t>You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; </t><t>therefore God, your God, <f>ⓢ</f>has anointed you </t><t>with <f>ⓣ</f>the oil of gladness beyond your companions.” </t>
Hebrews 1-10 <pb/>And, <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, </t><t>and the heavens are the work of your hands;</t>
Hebrews 1-11 <t>they will perish, but you remain; </t><t>they will all wear out like a garment,</t>
Hebrews 1-12 <t>like a robe you will roll them up, </t><t>like a garment they will be changed. <f>[1]</f> </t><t>But you are <f>ⓥ</f>the same, </t><t>and your years will have no end.” </t>
Hebrews 1-13 <pb/>And to which of the angels has he ever said, <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f>“Sit at my right hand </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”? </t>
Hebrews 1-14 <pb/>Are they not all ministering spirits <f>ⓨ</f>sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to <f>ⓩ</f>inherit salvation?
