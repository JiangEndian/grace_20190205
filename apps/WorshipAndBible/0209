2 Corinthians 2-1 <pb/>For I made up my mind <f>ⓐ</f>not to make another painful visit to you.
2 Corinthians 2-2 For <f>ⓑ</f>if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?

2 Corinthians 2-6 For such a one, <f>ⓗ</f>this punishment by the majority is enough,
2 Corinthians 2-7 so <f>ⓘ</f>you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
2 Corinthians 2-8 So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.
2 Corinthians 2-9 For this is why I wrote, that I might <f>ⓙ</f>test you and know <f>ⓚ</f>whether you are obedient in everything.
2 Corinthians 2-10 Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,

2 Corinthians 2-14 <pb/>But <f>ⓟ</f>thanks be to God, who in Christ always <f>ⓠ</f>leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads <f>ⓡ</f>the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.
2 Corinthians 2-15 For we are the aroma of Christ to God among <f>ⓢ</f>those who are being saved and among <f>ⓣ</f>those who are perishing,
2 Corinthians 2-16 <f>ⓤ</f> to one a fragrance from death to death, <f>ⓥ</f>to the other a fragrance from life to life. <f>ⓦ</f>Who is sufficient for these things?
2 Corinthians 2-17 For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.
