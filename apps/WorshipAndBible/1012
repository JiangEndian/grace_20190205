Judges 19-1 <pb/>In those days, <f>ⓐ</f>when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of <f>ⓑ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from <f>ⓒ</f>Bethlehem in Judah.
Judges 19-2 And his concubine was unfaithful to <f>[1]</f> him, and she went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months.
Judges 19-3 Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father's house. And when the girl's father saw him, he came with joy to meet him.
Judges 19-4 And his father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and spent the night there.
Judges 19-5 And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, <f>ⓓ</f>“Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go.”
Judges 19-6 So the two of them sat and ate and drank together. And the girl's father said to the man, “Be pleased to spend the night, and <f>ⓔ</f>let your heart be merry.”
Judges 19-7 And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law pressed him, till he spent the night there again.
Judges 19-8 And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart. And the girl's father said, <f>ⓕ</f>“Strengthen your heart and wait until the day declines.” So they ate, both of them.
Judges 19-9 And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, “Behold, now the day has waned toward evening. Please, spend the night. Behold, the day draws to its close. Lodge here and let your heart be merry, and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go home.”
Judges 19-10 <pb/>But the man would not spend the night. He rose up and departed and arrived opposite <f>ⓖ</f>Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him.
Judges 19-11 When they were near Jebus, the day was nearly over, and the servant said to his master, “Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.”
Judges 19-12 And his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel, but we will pass on to <f>ⓗ</f>Gibeah.”
Judges 19-13 And he said to his young man, “Come and let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night at Gibeah or at <f>ⓘ</f>Ramah.”
Judges 19-14 So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin,
Judges 19-15 and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city, <f>ⓙ</f>for no one took them into his house to spend the night.
Judges 19-16 <pb/>And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was from <f>ⓚ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, and he was sojourning in Gibeah. <f>ⓛ</f>The men of the place were Benjaminites.
Judges 19-17 And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city. And the old man said, “Where are you going? And where do you come from?”
Judges 19-18 And he said to him, “We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I come. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going <f>ⓜ</f>to the house of the LORD, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>but no one has taken me into his house.
Judges 19-19 We have straw and feed for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me and your female servant and the young man with your servants. <f>ⓞ</f>There is no lack of anything.”
Judges 19-20 And the old man said, <f>ⓟ</f>“Peace be to you; I will care for all your wants. <f>ⓠ</f>Only, do not spend the night in the square.”
Judges 19-21 So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys feed. <f>ⓡ</f>And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
Judges 19-22 <pb/>As they were <f>ⓢ</f>making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless fellows, <f>ⓣ</f>surrounded the house, beating on the door. And they said to the old man, the master of the house, “Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him.”
Judges 19-23 And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brothers, <f>ⓤ</f>do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, <f>ⓥ</f>do not do this vile thing.
Judges 19-24 <f>ⓦ</f> Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out now. <f>ⓧ</f>Violate them and do with them what seems good to you, but against this man <f>ⓨ</f>do not do this outrageous thing.”
Judges 19-25 But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and made her go out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go.
Judges 19-26 And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man's house where her master was, until it was light.
Judges 19-27 <pb/>And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
Judges 19-28 He said to her, “Get up, let us be going.” <f>ⓩ</f>But there was no answer. Then he put her on the donkey, and the man rose up and went away to his home.
Judges 19-29 And when he entered his house, he took a knife, and taking hold of his concubine he <f>ⓐ</f>divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.
Judges 19-30 <f>ⓑ</f> And all who saw it said, “Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day; <f>ⓒ</f>consider it, take counsel, and speak.”
Psalm 117-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Praise the LORD, all nations! </t><t>Extol him, all peoples!</t>
Psalm 117-2 <t>For <f>ⓑ</f>great is his steadfast love toward us, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever. </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>Praise the LORD! </t>
Mark 3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Again <f>ⓑ</f>he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand.
Mark 3-2 And <f>ⓒ</f>they watched Jesus, <f>[1]</f> to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.
Mark 3-3 And he said to the man with the withered hand, <J>“Come here.”</J>
Mark 3-4 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?”</J> But they were silent.
Mark 3-5 And he <f>ⓔ</f>looked around at them with anger, grieved at <f>ⓕ</f>their hardness of heart, and said to the man, <J>“Stretch out your hand.”</J> <f>ⓖ</f>He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
Mark 3-6 <f>ⓗ</f> The Pharisees went out and immediately <f>ⓘ</f>held counsel with <f>ⓙ</f>the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.
Mark 3-7 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and <f>ⓛ</f>a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea
Mark 3-8 and Jerusalem and <f>ⓜ</f>Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around <f>ⓝ</f>Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him.
Mark 3-9 And he told his disciples to <f>ⓞ</f>have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they <f>ⓟ</f>crush him,
Mark 3-10 for <f>ⓠ</f>he had healed many, so that all who had <f>ⓡ</f>diseases pressed around him <f>ⓢ</f>to touch him.
Mark 3-11 <f>ⓣ</f> And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they <f>ⓤ</f>fell down before him and cried out, “You are <f>ⓥ</f>the Son of God.”
Mark 3-12 And <f>ⓦ</f>he strictly ordered them not to make him known.
Mark 3-13 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> And he went up on the mountain and called to him those <f>ⓨ</f>whom he desired, and they came to him.
Mark 3-14 <f>ⓩ</f> And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach
Mark 3-15 <f>ⓐ</f> and have authority to cast out demons.
Mark 3-16 He appointed the twelve: <f>ⓑ</f>Simon (to whom <f>ⓒ</f>he gave the name Peter);
Mark 3-17 <f>ⓓ</f> James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);
Mark 3-18 Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and <f>ⓔ</f>Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, <f>[2]</f>
Mark 3-19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
Mark 3-20 <pb/>Then he went <f>ⓕ</f>home, and the crowd gathered again, <f>ⓖ</f>so that they could not even eat.
Mark 3-21 <f>ⓗ</f> And when <f>ⓘ</f>his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He <f>ⓙ</f>is out of his mind.”
Mark 3-22 <pb/>And <f>ⓚ</f>the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, <f>ⓛ</f>“He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.”
Mark 3-23 <f>ⓜ</f> And he called them to him and said to them in parables, <J>“How can Satan cast out Satan?</J>
Mark 3-24 <J>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</J>
Mark 3-25 <J>And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</J>
Mark 3-26 <J>And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.</J>
Mark 3-27 <J>But <f>ⓝ</f>no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. <f>ⓞ</f>Then indeed he may plunder his house.</J>
Mark 3-28 <pb/><J><f>ⓟ</f> “Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter,</J>
Mark 3-29 <J>but whoever <f>ⓠ</f>blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”</J> —
Mark 3-30 for they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
Mark 3-31 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And his mother and his <f>ⓢ</f>brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him.
Mark 3-32 And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers <f>[3]</f> are outside, seeking you.”
Mark 3-33 And he answered them, <J>“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</J>
Mark 3-34 And <f>ⓣ</f>looking about at those who sat around him, he said, <J>“Here are my mother and my brothers!</J>
Mark 3-35 <J><f>ⓤ</f> For whoever <f>ⓥ</f>does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.”</J>
