10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when <f>ⓑ</f>the queen of <f>ⓒ</f>Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came <f>ⓓ</f>to test him with hard questions.
10-2 She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels <f>ⓔ</f>bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.
10-3 And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.
10-4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
10-5 the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her.
10-6 <pb/>And she said to the king, “The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom,
10-7 but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard.
10-8 <f>ⓕ</f> Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
10-9 <f>ⓖ</f> Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! <f>ⓗ</f>Because the LORD loved Israel forever, he has made you king, <f>ⓘ</f>that you may execute justice and righteousness.”
10-10 <f>ⓙ</f> Then she gave the king 120 talents <f>[1]</f> of gold, and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again came such an abundance of spices as these that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
10-11 <pb/>Moreover, <f>ⓚ</f>the fleet of Hiram, which brought <f>ⓛ</f>gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones.
10-12 And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, also lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.
10-13 <pb/>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.
10-14 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,
10-15 besides that which came from the explorers and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of the west and from the governors of the land.
10-16 King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels <f>[2]</f> of gold went into each shield.
10-17 And he made 300 <f>ⓝ</f>shields of beaten gold; three minas <f>[3]</f> of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in <f>ⓞ</f>the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
10-18 The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with the finest gold.
10-19 The throne had six steps, and the throne had a round top, <f>[4]</f> and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests,
10-20 while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom.
10-21 All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of <f>ⓟ</f>the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.
10-22 For the king had <f>ⓠ</f>a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. <f>[5]</f>
10-23 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
10-24 And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.
10-25 Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, <f>[6]</f> spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.
10-26 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> And Solomon gathered together <f>ⓣ</f>chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the <f>ⓤ</f>chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
10-27 And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as <f>ⓥ</f>the sycamore of the Shephelah.
10-28 And Solomon's <f>ⓦ</f>import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders received them from Kue at a price.
10-29 A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150, and so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of <f>ⓧ</f>the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
7-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> A good name is better than precious ointment, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>the day of death than the day of birth.</t>
7-2 <t>It is better to go to the house of mourning </t><t>than to go to the house of feasting, </t><t>for this is the end of all mankind, </t><t>and the living will <f>ⓒ</f>lay it to heart.</t>
7-3 <t>Sorrow is better than laughter, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.</t>
7-4 <t>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, </t><t>but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</t>
7-5 <t>It is <f>ⓔ</f>better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise </t><t>than to hear the song of fools.</t>
7-6 <t><f>ⓕ</f> For as the crackling of <f>ⓖ</f>thorns under a pot, </t><t>so is the laughter of the fools; </t><t>this also is vanity. <f>[1]</f></t>
7-7 <t>Surely <f>ⓗ</f>oppression drives the wise into madness, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>a bribe corrupts the heart.</t>
7-8 <t>Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</t>
7-9 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>for anger lodges in the heart <f>[2]</f> of fools.</t>
7-10 <t>Say not, “Why were the former days better than these?” </t><t>For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.</t>
7-11 <t>Wisdom is good with an inheritance, </t><t>an advantage to those who <f>ⓜ</f>see the sun.</t>
7-12 <t>For the protection of wisdom is like <f>ⓝ</f>the protection of money, </t><t>and the advantage of knowledge is that <f>ⓞ</f>wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</t>
7-13 <t>Consider <f>ⓟ</f>the work of God: </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>who can make straight what he has made crooked? </t>
7-14 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, <f>ⓢ</f>so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.
7-15 <pb/>In my <f>ⓣ</f>vain <f>[3]</f> life I have seen everything. There is <f>ⓤ</f>a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who <f>ⓥ</f>prolongs his life in his evildoing.
7-16 Be not overly righteous, and do not <f>ⓦ</f>make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?
7-17 Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. <f>ⓧ</f>Why should you die before your time?
7-18 It is good that you should take hold of <f>ⓨ</f>this, and from <f>ⓩ</f>that <f>ⓐ</f>withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.
7-19 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
7-20 <pb/>Surely <f>ⓒ</f>there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.
7-21 <pb/>Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear <f>ⓓ</f>your servant cursing you.
7-22 Your heart knows that <f>ⓔ</f>many times you yourself have cursed others.
7-23 <pb/>All this I have tested by wisdom. <f>ⓕ</f>I said, “I will be wise,” but it was far from me.
7-24 That which has been is far off, and <f>ⓖ</f>deep, very deep; <f>ⓗ</f>who can find it out?
7-25 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness.
7-26 And I find something more <f>ⓙ</f>bitter than death: <f>ⓚ</f>the woman whose heart is <f>ⓛ</f>snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but <f>ⓜ</f>the sinner is taken by her.
7-27 Behold, this is what I found, says <f>ⓝ</f>the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things —
7-28 which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. <f>ⓞ</f>One man among a thousand I found, but <f>ⓟ</f>a woman among all these I have not found.
7-29 See, this alone I found, that <f>ⓠ</f>God made man upright, but <f>ⓡ</f>they have sought out many schemes.
13-1 <pb/>Now there were in the church at Antioch <f>ⓐ</f>prophets and <f>ⓑ</f>teachers, <f>ⓒ</f>Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, <f>[1]</f> Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of <f>ⓓ</f>Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
13-2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, <f>ⓔ</f>the Holy Spirit said, <f>ⓕ</f>“Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul <f>ⓖ</f>for the work to which I have called them.”
13-3 Then after fasting and <f>ⓗ</f>praying they laid their hands on them and <f>ⓘ</f>sent them off.
13-4 <pb/>So, being sent out <f>ⓙ</f>by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
13-5 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God <f>ⓚ</f>in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had <f>ⓛ</f>John to <f>ⓜ</f>assist them.
13-6 When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain <f>ⓝ</f>magician, <f>ⓞ</f>a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
13-7 He was with <f>ⓟ</f>the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
13-8 But Elymas the <f>ⓠ</f>magician (for that is the meaning of his name) <f>ⓡ</f>opposed them, seeking to turn <f>ⓢ</f>the proconsul away from the faith.
13-9 But Saul, who was also called Paul, <f>ⓣ</f>filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him
13-10 and said, “You <f>ⓤ</f>son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and <f>ⓥ</f>villainy, will you not stop <f>ⓦ</f>making crooked <f>ⓧ</f>the straight paths of the Lord?
13-11 And now, behold, <f>ⓨ</f>the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.” Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking <f>ⓩ</f>people to lead him by the hand.
13-12 Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at <f>ⓐ</f>the teaching of the Lord.
13-13 <pb/>Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And <f>ⓑ</f>John left them and returned <f>ⓒ</f>to Jerusalem,
13-14 but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And <f>ⓓ</f>on the Sabbath day <f>ⓔ</f>they went into the synagogue and sat down.
13-15 After <f>ⓕ</f>the reading from <f>ⓖ</f>the Law and the Prophets, <f>ⓗ</f>the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any <f>ⓘ</f>word of encouragement for the people, say it.”
13-16 So Paul stood up, and <f>ⓙ</f>motioning with his hand said: <pb/>“Men of Israel and <f>ⓚ</f>you who fear God, listen.
13-17 <f>ⓛ</f> The God of this people Israel <f>ⓜ</f>chose our fathers and <f>ⓝ</f>made the people great <f>ⓞ</f>during their stay in the land of Egypt, and <f>ⓟ</f>with uplifted arm he led them out of it.
13-18 And for about <f>ⓠ</f>forty years <f>ⓡ</f>he put up with <f>[2]</f> them in the wilderness.
13-19 And <f>ⓢ</f>after destroying <f>ⓣ</f>seven nations in the land of Canaan, <f>ⓤ</f>he gave them their land as an inheritance.
13-20 All this took about 450 years. And after that <f>ⓥ</f>he gave them judges until <f>ⓦ</f>Samuel the prophet.
13-21 Then <f>ⓧ</f>they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul <f>ⓨ</f>the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
13-22 And <f>ⓩ</f>when he had removed him, <f>ⓐ</f>he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, <f>ⓑ</f>‘I have found in David the son of Jesse <f>ⓒ</f>a man after my heart, <f>ⓓ</f>who will do all my will.’
13-23 <f>ⓔ</f> Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel <f>ⓕ</f>a Savior, Jesus, <f>ⓖ</f>as he promised.
13-24 Before his coming, <f>ⓗ</f>John had proclaimed <f>ⓘ</f>a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
13-25 And as John was finishing his course, <f>ⓙ</f>he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’
13-26 <pb/>“Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you <f>ⓚ</f>who fear God, to us has been sent <f>ⓛ</f>the message of <f>ⓜ</f>this salvation.
13-27 For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because <f>ⓝ</f>they did not recognize him nor understand <f>ⓞ</f>the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, <f>ⓟ</f>fulfilled them by condemning him.
13-28 And <f>ⓠ</f>though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, <f>ⓡ</f>they asked Pilate to have him executed.
13-29 And when <f>ⓢ</f>they had carried out all that was written of him, <f>ⓣ</f>they took him down from <f>ⓤ</f>the tree and laid him in a tomb.
13-30 But <f>ⓥ</f>God raised him from the dead,
13-31 and for many days <f>ⓦ</f>he appeared to those <f>ⓧ</f>who had come up with him <f>ⓨ</f>from Galilee to Jerusalem, <f>ⓩ</f>who are now <f>ⓐ</f>his witnesses to the people.
13-32 And we bring you the good news <f>ⓑ</f>that what God promised to the fathers,
13-33 <f>ⓒ</f> this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“‘You are my Son, </t><t>today I have begotten you.’ </t>
13-34 <pb/>And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, <f>ⓔ</f> <f>ⓕ</f>no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, <pb/><t>“‘I will give you <f>ⓖ</f>the holy and sure blessings of David.’ </t>
13-35 <pb/>Therefore he says also in another psalm, <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f>“‘You will not let your Holy One see corruption.’ </t>
13-36 <pb/>For David, after he had <f>ⓘ</f>served the purpose of God in his own generation, <f>ⓙ</f>fell asleep and <f>ⓚ</f>was laid with his fathers and saw corruption,
13-37 but he whom <f>ⓛ</f>God raised up did not see corruption.
13-38 Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, <f>ⓜ</f>that through this man <f>ⓝ</f>forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
13-39 and by him <f>ⓞ</f>everyone who believes is freed <f>[3]</f> from everything <f>ⓟ</f>from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.
13-40 Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:
13-41 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> “‘Look, you scoffers, </t><t>be astounded and perish; </t><t>for I am doing a work in your days, </t><t>a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.’” </t>
13-42 <pb/>As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath.
13-43 And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and <f>ⓡ</f>devout <f>ⓢ</f>converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them <f>ⓣ</f>to continue in <f>ⓤ</f>the grace of God.
13-44 <pb/>The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
13-45 <f>ⓥ</f> But <f>ⓦ</f>when the Jews <f>[4]</f> saw the crowds, they were filled with <f>ⓧ</f>jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, <f>ⓨ</f>reviling him.
13-46 And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, “It was necessary that the word of God <f>ⓩ</f>be spoken first to you. <f>ⓐ</f>Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves <f>ⓑ</f>unworthy of eternal life, behold, we <f>ⓒ</f>are turning to the Gentiles.
13-47 <f>ⓓ</f> For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f>“‘I have made you <f>ⓕ</f>a light for the Gentiles, </t><t>that you may <f>ⓖ</f>bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’” </t>
13-48 <pb/>And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and <f>ⓗ</f>glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
13-49 And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region.
13-50 <f>ⓘ</f> But the Jews incited the devout <f>ⓙ</f>women of high standing and the leading men of the city, <f>ⓚ</f>stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and <f>ⓛ</f>drove them out of their district.
13-51 But they <f>ⓜ</f>shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.
13-52 And the disciples were filled <f>ⓝ</f>with joy and <f>ⓞ</f>with the Holy Spirit.
