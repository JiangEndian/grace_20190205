15-1 <pb/>“At the end of <f>ⓐ</f>every seven years you shall grant a release.
15-2 And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release what he has lent to his neighbor. He shall not exact it of his neighbor, his brother, because the LORD's release has been proclaimed.
15-3 <f>ⓑ</f> Of a foreigner you may exact it, but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand shall release.
15-4 <f>ⓒ</f> But there will be no poor among you; <f>ⓓ</f>for the LORD will bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance to possess —
15-5 <f>ⓔ</f> if only you will strictly obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all this commandment that I command you today.
15-6 For the LORD your God will bless you, <f>ⓕ</f>as he promised you, and <f>ⓖ</f>you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow, and <f>ⓗ</f>you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over you.
15-7 <pb/>“If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the LORD your God is giving you, <f>ⓘ</f>you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother,
15-8 but <f>ⓙ</f>you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be.
15-9 Take care lest there be an unworthy thought in your heart and you say, ‘The seventh year, the year of release is near,’ and your <f>ⓚ</f>eye look grudgingly <f>[1]</f> on your poor brother, and you give him nothing, and he <f>ⓛ</f>cry to the LORD against you, and <f>ⓜ</f>you be guilty of sin.
15-10 You shall give to him freely, and <f>ⓝ</f>your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him, because <f>ⓞ</f>for this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake.
15-11 For <f>ⓟ</f>there will never cease to be poor in the land. Therefore I command you, <f>ⓠ</f>‘You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor, in your land.’
15-12 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> “If your brother, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, is sold <f>[2]</f> to you, he shall serve you six years, and in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.
15-13 And when you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty-handed.
15-14 You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress. <f>ⓢ</f>As the LORD your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
15-15 <f>ⓣ</f> You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this today.
15-16 But <f>ⓤ</f>if he says to you, ‘I will not go out from you,’ because he loves you and your household, since he is well-off with you,
15-17 then you shall take an awl, and put it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your slave <f>[3]</f> forever. And to your female slave <f>[4]</f> you shall do the same.
15-18 It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you, for at half the cost of a hired worker he has served you six years. So the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do.
15-19 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> “All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and flock you shall dedicate to the LORD your God. You shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
15-20 <f>ⓦ</f> You shall eat it, you and your household, before the LORD your God year by year at the place that the LORD will choose.
15-21 <f>ⓧ</f> But if it has any blemish, if it is lame or blind or has any serious blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
15-22 You shall eat it within your towns. <f>ⓨ</f>The unclean and the clean alike may eat it, as though it were a gazelle or a deer.
15-23 <f>ⓩ</f> Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on the ground like water.
55-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> Give ear to my prayer, O God, </t><t>and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy!</t>
55-2 <t>Attend to me, and answer me; </t><t>I am restless <f>ⓒ</f>in my complaint and I <f>ⓓ</f>moan,</t>
55-3 <t>because of the noise of the enemy, </t><t>because of the oppression of the wicked. </t><t>For they <f>ⓔ</f>drop trouble upon me, </t><t>and in anger they bear a grudge against me. </t>
55-4 <pb/><t>My heart is in anguish within me; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the terrors of death have fallen upon me.</t>
55-5 <t>Fear and trembling come upon me, </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>horror <f>ⓗ</f>overwhelms me.</t>
55-6 <t>And I say, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! </t><t>I would fly away and be at rest;</t>
55-7 <t><f>ⓘ</f> yes, I would wander far away; </t><t>I would lodge in the wilderness; <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
55-8 <t>I would hurry to find a shelter </t><t>from <f>ⓙ</f>the raging wind and tempest.” </t>
55-9 <pb/><t>Destroy, O Lord, <f>ⓚ</f>divide their tongues; </t><t>for I see <f>ⓛ</f>violence and strife in the city.</t>
55-10 <t>Day and night they go around it </t><t>on its walls, </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>iniquity and trouble are within it;</t>
55-11 <t>ruin is in its midst; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>oppression and fraud </t><t>do not depart from its marketplace. </t>
55-12 <pb/><t>For it is not an enemy who taunts me — </t><t>then I could bear it; </t><t>it is not an adversary who <f>ⓞ</f>deals insolently with me — </t><t>then I could hide from him.</t>
55-13 <t><f>ⓟ</f> But it is you, a man, my equal, </t><t>my companion, my familiar friend.</t>
55-14 <t>We used to take sweet counsel together; </t><t>within God's house we walked in <f>ⓠ</f>the throng.</t>
55-15 <t>Let death steal over them; </t><t>let them go down to Sheol <f>ⓡ</f>alive; </t><t>for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart. </t>
55-16 <pb/><t>But I call to God, </t><t>and the LORD will save me.</t>
55-17 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Evening and <f>ⓣ</f>morning and at <f>ⓤ</f>noon </t><t>I <f>ⓥ</f>utter my complaint and moan, </t><t>and he hears my voice.</t>
55-18 <t>He redeems my soul in safety </t><t>from the battle that I wage, </t><t>for <f>ⓦ</f>many are arrayed against me.</t>
55-19 <t>God will give ear and humble them, </t><t>he who is <f>ⓧ</f>enthroned from of old, <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t><t>because they do not <f>ⓨ</f>change </t><t>and do not fear God. </t>
55-20 <pb/><t>My companion <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>stretched out his hand against his friends; </t><t>he violated his covenant.</t>
55-21 <t>His <f>ⓐ</f>speech was <f>ⓑ</f>smooth as butter, </t><t>yet war was in his heart; </t><t>his words were softer than oil, </t><t>yet they were <f>ⓒ</f>drawn swords. </t>
55-22 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> Cast your burden on the LORD, </t><t>and he will sustain you; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>he will never permit </t><t>the righteous to be moved. </t>
55-23 <pb/><t>But you, O God, <f>ⓕ</f>will cast them down </t><t>into <f>ⓖ</f>the pit of destruction; </t><t>men of <f>ⓗ</f>blood and treachery </t><t>shall not <f>ⓘ</f>live out half their days. </t><t>But I will <f>ⓙ</f>trust in you. </t>
5-1 <pb/><t><f>[1]</f> Now muster your troops, O daughter <f>[2]</f> of troops; </t><t>siege is laid against us; </t><t>with a rod <f>ⓐ</f>they strike the judge of Israel </t><t>on the cheek.</t>
5-2 <t><f>[3]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, </t><t>who are too little to be among the clans of <f>ⓒ</f>Judah, </t><t>from you shall come forth for me </t><t>one who is to be <f>ⓓ</f>ruler in Israel, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>whose coming forth is <f>ⓕ</f>from of old, </t><t>from ancient days.</t>
5-3 <t>Therefore he shall give them up <f>ⓖ</f>until the time </t><t>when she who is in labor has given birth; </t><t>then <f>ⓗ</f>the rest of his brothers shall return </t><t>to the people of Israel.</t>
5-4 <t>And he shall stand <f>ⓘ</f>and shepherd his flock <f>ⓙ</f>in the strength of the LORD, </t><t>in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. </t><t>And they shall dwell secure, for now <f>ⓚ</f>he shall be great </t><t>to the ends of the earth.</t>
5-5 <t>And he shall be <f>ⓛ</f>their peace. </t> <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>When the Assyrian comes into our land </t><t>and treads in our palaces, </t><t>then we will raise against him seven <f>ⓝ</f>shepherds </t><t>and eight princes of men;</t>

5-7 <pb/><t>Then <f>ⓠ</f>the remnant of Jacob shall be </t><t>in the midst of many peoples </t><t>like dew from the LORD, </t><t>like showers on the grass, </t><t>which delay not for a man </t><t>nor wait for the children of man.</t>
5-8 <t>And <f>ⓡ</f>the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, </t><t>in the midst of many peoples, </t><t>like a lion among the beasts of the forest, </t><t>like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>which, when it goes through, treads down </t><t>and tears in pieces, and there is none to deliver.</t>
5-9 <t>Your hand shall <f>ⓣ</f>be lifted up over your adversaries, </t><t>and all your enemies shall be cut off. </t>
