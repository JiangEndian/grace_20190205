29-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now the Philistines had gathered all their forces at <f>ⓑ</f>Aphek. And the Israelites were encamped by <f>ⓒ</f>the spring that is in <f>ⓓ</f>Jezreel.
29-2 As <f>ⓔ</f>the lords of the Philistines were passing on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were passing on in the rear <f>ⓕ</f>with Achish,
29-3 the commanders of the Philistines said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me <f>ⓖ</f>now for days and years, and since he deserted to me <f>ⓗ</f>I have found no fault in him to this day.”
29-4 But <f>ⓘ</f>the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him. And the commanders of the Philistines said to him, “Send the man back, that he may return <f>ⓙ</f>to the place to which you have assigned him. He shall not go down with us to battle, <f>ⓚ</f>lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?
29-5 Is not this David, of whom they sing to one another in dances, <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f>‘Saul has struck down his thousands, </t><t>and David his ten thousands’?” </t>
29-6 <pb/>Then Achish called David and said to him, <f>ⓜ</f>“As the LORD lives, you have been honest, and to me it seems right that <f>ⓝ</f>you should march out and in with me in the campaign. For I have found nothing wrong in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless, the lords do not approve of you.
29-7 So go back now; and go peaceably, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.”
29-8 And David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
29-9 And Achish answered David and said, “I know that you are as blameless in my sight <f>ⓞ</f>as an angel of God. Nevertheless, <f>ⓟ</f>the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’
29-10 Now then rise early in the morning <f>ⓠ</f>with the servants of your lord who came with you, and start early in the morning, and depart as soon as you have light.”
29-11 So David set out with his men early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to <f>ⓡ</f>Jezreel.
2-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> My son, <f>ⓑ</f>if you receive my words </t><t>and treasure up my commandments with you,</t>
2-2 <t>making your ear attentive to wisdom </t><t>and inclining your heart to understanding;</t>
2-3 <t>yes, if you call out for insight </t><t>and raise your voice <f>ⓒ</f>for understanding,</t>
2-4 <t>if you seek it like <f>ⓓ</f>silver </t><t>and search for it as for <f>ⓔ</f>hidden treasures,</t>
2-5 <t>then <f>ⓕ</f>you will understand the fear of the LORD </t><t>and find the knowledge of God.</t>
2-6 <t>For <f>ⓖ</f>the LORD gives wisdom; </t><t>from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</t>
2-7 <t>he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; </t><t>he is <f>ⓗ</f>a shield to those who <f>ⓘ</f>walk in integrity,</t>
2-8 <t>guarding the paths of justice </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>watching over the way of his <f>ⓚ</f>saints.</t>
2-9 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Then you will understand <f>ⓜ</f>righteousness and justice </t><t>and equity, every good path;</t>
2-10 <t>for wisdom will come into your heart, </t><t>and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</t>
2-11 <t><f>ⓝ</f> discretion will <f>ⓞ</f>watch over you, </t><t>understanding will guard you,</t>
2-12 <t>delivering you from the way of evil, </t><t>from men of perverted speech,</t>
2-13 <t>who forsake the paths of uprightness </t><t>to <f>ⓟ</f>walk in the ways of darkness,</t>
2-14 <t>who <f>ⓠ</f>rejoice in doing evil </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>delight in the perverseness of evil,</t>
2-15 <t>men whose <f>ⓢ</f>paths are crooked, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>and who are <f>ⓤ</f>devious in their ways. </t>
2-16 <pb/><t>So <f>ⓥ</f>you will be delivered from the forbidden <f>[1]</f> woman, </t><t>from <f>ⓦ</f>the adulteress <f>[2]</f> with <f>ⓧ</f>her smooth words,</t>
2-17 <t>who forsakes <f>ⓨ</f>the companion of her youth </t><t>and forgets <f>ⓩ</f>the covenant of her God;</t>
2-18 <t><f>ⓐ</f> for her house sinks down to death, </t><t>and her paths to the departed; <f>[3]</f></t>
2-19 <t>none who go to her come back, </t><t>nor do they regain the paths of life. </t>
2-20 <pb/><t>So you will walk in the way of the good </t><t>and keep to the paths of the righteous.</t>
2-21 <t>For the upright <f>ⓑ</f>will inhabit the land, </t><t>and those with integrity will remain in it,</t>
2-22 <t>but the wicked will be <f>ⓒ</f>cut off from the land, </t><t>and the treacherous will be <f>ⓓ</f>rooted out of it. </t>
22-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called <f>ⓑ</f>the Passover.
22-2 And the chief priests and the scribes <f>ⓒ</f>were seeking how to put him to death, for they feared the people.
22-3 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Then <f>ⓔ</f>Satan entered into <f>ⓕ</f>Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.
22-4 He went away and conferred with the chief priests and <f>ⓖ</f>officers how he might betray him to them.
22-5 And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.
22-6 So he consented and sought an opportunity to <f>ⓗ</f>betray him to them in the absence of a crowd.
22-7 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Then came <f>ⓙ</f>the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
22-8 So Jesus <f>[1]</f> sent Peter and John, saying, <J>“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.”</J>
22-9 They said to him, “Where will you have us prepare it?”
22-10 He said to them, <J>“Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters</J>
22-11 <J>and tell the master of the house, <f>ⓚ</f>‘The Teacher says to you, Where is <f>ⓛ</f>the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</J>
22-12 <J>And he will show you <f>ⓜ</f>a large upper room furnished; prepare it there.”</J>
22-13 And they went and found it <f>ⓝ</f>just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
22-14 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> And when the hour came, he reclined at table, and the apostles with him.
22-15 And he said to them, <J>“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</J>
22-16 <J>For I tell you I will not eat it <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</J>
22-17 And he took a cup, and <f>ⓠ</f>when he had given thanks he said, <J>“Take this, and divide it among yourselves.</J>
22-18 <J><f>ⓡ</f> For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine <f>ⓢ</f>until the kingdom of God comes.”</J>
22-19 <f>ⓣ</f> And he took bread, and <f>ⓤ</f>when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</J>
22-20 And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, <J> <f>ⓦ</f>“This cup that is poured out for you is <f>ⓧ</f>the new <f>ⓨ</f>covenant in my blood. <f>[3]</f></J>
22-21 <J><f>ⓩ</f> But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is <f>ⓐ</f>with me on the table.</J>
22-22 <J>For the Son of Man goes <f>ⓑ</f>as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!”</J>
22-23 And they began to question one another, which of them it could be who was going to do this.
22-24 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> A dispute also arose among them, as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.
22-25 <f>ⓓ</f> And he said to them, <J>“The kings of the Gentiles <f>ⓔ</f>exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors.</J>
22-26 <J><f>ⓕ</f> But not so with you. Rather, let <f>ⓖ</f>the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.</J>
22-27 <J>For who is the greater, <f>ⓗ</f>one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But <f>ⓘ</f>I am among you as the one who serves.</J>
22-28 <pb/><J>“You are those who have stayed with me <f>ⓙ</f>in my trials,</J>
22-29 <J>and <f>ⓚ</f>I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom,</J>
22-30 <J><f>ⓛ</f> that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and <f>ⓜ</f>sit on thrones judging <f>ⓝ</f>the twelve tribes of Israel.</J>
22-31 <pb/><J>“Simon, Simon, behold, <f>ⓞ</f>Satan demanded to have you, <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>that he might sift you like wheat,</J>
22-32 <J>but <f>ⓠ</f>I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, <f>ⓡ</f>strengthen your brothers.”</J>
22-33 Peter <f>[5]</f> said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both <f>ⓢ</f>to prison and <f>ⓣ</f>to death.”
22-34 <f>ⓤ</f> Jesus <f>[6]</f> said, <J>“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you deny three times that you know me.”</J>
22-35 <pb/>And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“When I sent you out with no moneybag or knapsack or sandals, did you lack anything?”</J> They said, “Nothing.”
22-36 He said to them, <J>“But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and likewise a knapsack. And let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.</J>
22-37 <J>For I tell you that <f>ⓦ</f>this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: <f>ⓧ</f>‘And he was numbered with the transgressors.’ For <f>ⓨ</f>what is written about me has its fulfillment.”</J>
22-38 And they said, “Look, Lord, here are two <f>ⓩ</f>swords.” And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“It is enough.”</J>
22-39 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> And he came out and went, <f>ⓒ</f>as was his custom, to <f>ⓓ</f>the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.
22-40 <f>ⓔ</f> And when he came to <f>ⓕ</f>the place, he said to them, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Pray that you may not <f>ⓗ</f>enter into temptation.”</J>
22-41 And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and <f>ⓘ</f>knelt down and prayed,
22-42 saying, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“Father, if you are willing, remove <f>ⓚ</f>this cup from me. <f>ⓛ</f>Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</J>
22-43 And there appeared to him <f>ⓜ</f>an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
22-44 And <f>ⓝ</f>being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. <f>[7]</f>
22-45 And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow,
22-46 and he said to them, <J>“Why are you sleeping? Rise and <f>ⓞ</f>pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</J>
22-47 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called <f>ⓠ</f>Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him,
22-48 but Jesus said to him, <J>“Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</J>
22-49 And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, “Lord, shall we strike <f>ⓡ</f>with the sword?”
22-50 And one of them struck the servant <f>[8]</f> of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
22-51 But Jesus said, <J>“No more of this!”</J> And he touched his ear and healed him.
22-52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests and <f>ⓢ</f>officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, <J>“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</J>
22-53 <J>When <f>ⓣ</f>I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is <f>ⓤ</f>your hour, and <f>ⓥ</f>the power of darkness.”</J>
22-54 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house, <f>ⓧ</f>and Peter was following at a distance.
22-55 <f>ⓨ</f> And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of <f>ⓩ</f>the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
22-56 Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, “This man also was with him.”
22-57 But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.”
22-58 And a little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”
22-59 And after an interval of about an hour still another <f>ⓐ</f>insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.”
22-60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
22-61 And the Lord turned and <f>ⓑ</f>looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“Before the rooster crows today, you will <f>ⓓ</f>deny me three times.”</J>
22-62 And he went out and wept bitterly.
22-63 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him.
22-64 <f>ⓕ</f> They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Prophesy! <f>ⓗ</f>Who is it that struck you?”
22-65 And they said many other things against him, <f>ⓘ</f>blaspheming him.
22-66 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> When day came, <f>ⓚ</f>the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. And they led him away to their <f>ⓛ</f>council, and they <f>ⓜ</f>said,
22-67 <f>ⓝ</f> “If you are <f>ⓞ</f>the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, <J>“If I tell you, you will not believe,</J>
22-68 <J>and if I ask you, you will not answer.</J>
22-69 <J>But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated <f>ⓟ</f>at the right hand of the power of God.”</J>
22-70 So they all said, “Are you <f>ⓠ</f>the Son of God, then?” And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓡ</f>“You say that I am.”</J>
22-71 Then they said, “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.”
