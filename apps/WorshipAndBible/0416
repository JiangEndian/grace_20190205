Exodus 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:
Exodus 1-2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Exodus 1-3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Exodus 1-4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
Exodus 1-5 All the descendants of Jacob were <f>ⓑ</f>seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus 1-6 Then <f>ⓒ</f>Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.
Exodus 1-7 <f>ⓓ</f> But the people of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them.
Exodus 1-8 <pb/>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, <f>ⓔ</f>who did not know Joseph.
Exodus 1-9 And he said to his people, “Behold, <f>ⓕ</f>the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us.
Exodus 1-10 <f>ⓖ</f> Come, <f>ⓗ</f>let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.”
Exodus 1-11 Therefore they set taskmasters over them <f>ⓘ</f>to afflict them with heavy <f>ⓙ</f>burdens. They built for Pharaoh <f>ⓚ</f>store cities, Pithom and <f>ⓛ</f>Raamses.
Exodus 1-12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel.
Exodus 1-13 So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel <f>ⓜ</f>work as slaves
Exodus 1-14 and <f>ⓝ</f>made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves.
Exodus 1-15 <pb/>Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,
Exodus 1-16 “When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live.”
Exodus 1-17 But the midwives <f>ⓞ</f>feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live.
Exodus 1-18 So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this, and let the male children live?”
Exodus 1-19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.”
Exodus 1-20 <f>ⓟ</f> So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong.
Exodus 1-21 And because the midwives feared God, <f>ⓠ</f>he gave them families.
Exodus 1-22 Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, <f>ⓡ</f>“Every son that is born to the Hebrews <f>[1]</f> you shall cast into <f>ⓢ</f>the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.”

Jeremiah 36-1 <pb/>In the <f>ⓐ</f>fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 36-2 “Take <f>ⓑ</f>a scroll and <f>ⓒ</f>write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and <f>ⓓ</f>Judah <f>ⓔ</f>and all the nations, <f>ⓕ</f>from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.
Jeremiah 36-3 <f>ⓖ</f> It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, <f>ⓗ</f>so that every one may turn from his evil way, and <f>ⓘ</f>that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
Jeremiah 36-4 <pb/>Then Jeremiah called <f>ⓙ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah, and <f>ⓚ</f>Baruch wrote on <f>ⓛ</f>a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him.
Jeremiah 36-5 And Jeremiah ordered <f>ⓜ</f>Baruch, saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“I am banned from going to the house of the LORD,
Jeremiah 36-6 so you are to go, and <f>ⓞ</f>on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the LORD's house you shall read the words of the LORD from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities.
Jeremiah 36-7 <f>ⓟ</f> It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, <f>ⓠ</f>and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people.”
Jeremiah 36-8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.
Jeremiah 36-9 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, <f>ⓢ</f>in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem <f>ⓣ</f>proclaimed a fast before the LORD.
Jeremiah 36-10 Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in <f>ⓤ</f>the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD's house.
Jeremiah 36-11 <pb/>When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of <f>ⓥ</f>Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,
Jeremiah 36-12 he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber, and <f>ⓦ</f>all the officials were sitting there: <f>ⓧ</f>Elishama the secretary, <f>ⓨ</f>Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, <f>ⓩ</f>Elnathan <f>ⓐ</f>the son of Achbor, <f>ⓑ</f>Gemariah the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials.
Jeremiah 36-13 And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.
Jeremiah 36-14 Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of <f>ⓓ</f>Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
Jeremiah 36-15 And they said to him, “Sit down and read it.” So Baruch read it to them.
Jeremiah 36-16 When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, <f>ⓔ</f>“We must report all these words to the king.”
Jeremiah 36-17 Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”
Jeremiah 36-18 Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, <f>ⓕ</f>while I wrote them with ink on the scroll.”
Jeremiah 36-19 Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.”
Jeremiah 36-20 <pb/>So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in <f>ⓖ</f>the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king.
Jeremiah 36-21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king.
Jeremiah 36-22 It was <f>ⓗ</f>the ninth month, and the king was sitting in <f>ⓘ</f>the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him.
Jeremiah 36-23 As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot.
Jeremiah 36-24 Yet <f>ⓙ</f>neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, <f>ⓚ</f>nor did they tear their garments.
Jeremiah 36-25 Even when <f>ⓛ</f>Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah <f>ⓜ</f>urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
Jeremiah 36-26 And the king commanded Jerahmeel the <f>ⓝ</f>king's son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and <f>ⓞ</f>Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize <f>ⓟ</f>Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.
Jeremiah 36-27 <pb/>Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 36-28 “Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
Jeremiah 36-29 And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, <f>ⓠ</f>“Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?”
Jeremiah 36-30 Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: <f>ⓡ</f>He shall have none <f>ⓢ</f>to sit on the throne of David, <f>ⓣ</f>and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.
Jeremiah 36-31 <f>ⓤ</f> And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.’”
Jeremiah 36-32 <pb/>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to <f>ⓥ</f>Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who <f>ⓦ</f>wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.
James 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> James, a servant <f>[1]</f> of God and <f>ⓑ</f>of the Lord Jesus Christ, <pb/>To <f>ⓒ</f>the twelve tribes in <f>ⓓ</f>the Dispersion: <pb/>Greetings.
James 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Count it all joy, my brothers, <f>[2]</f> when you meet trials <f>ⓕ</f>of various kinds,
James 1-3 for you know that <f>ⓖ</f>the testing of your faith <f>ⓗ</f>produces steadfastness.
James 1-4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be <f>ⓘ</f>perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
James 1-5 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> If any of you lacks wisdom, <f>ⓚ</f>let him ask God, <f>ⓛ</f>who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
James 1-6 But <f>ⓜ</f>let him ask in faith, <f>ⓝ</f>with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like <f>ⓞ</f>a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
James 1-7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
James 1-8 <f>ⓟ</f> he is a double-minded man, <f>ⓠ</f>unstable in all his ways.
James 1-9 <pb/>Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
James 1-10 and <f>ⓡ</f>the rich in his humiliation, because <f>ⓢ</f>like a flower of the grass <f>[3]</f> he will pass away.
James 1-11 For the sun rises with its scorching heat and <f>ⓣ</f>withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.
James 1-12 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive <f>ⓥ</f>the crown of life, <f>ⓦ</f>which God has promised to those who love him.
James 1-13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.
James 1-14 But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.
James 1-15 Then desire <f>ⓧ</f>when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and <f>ⓨ</f>sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.
James 1-16 <pb/>Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
James 1-17 <f>ⓩ</f> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from <f>ⓐ</f>the Father of lights, <f>ⓑ</f>with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. <f>[4]</f>
James 1-18 <f>ⓒ</f> Of his own will he <f>ⓓ</f>brought us forth by the word of truth, <f>ⓔ</f>that we should be a kind of <f>ⓕ</f>firstfruits of his creatures.
James 1-19 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person <f>ⓗ</f>be quick to hear, <f>ⓘ</f>slow to speak, <f>ⓙ</f>slow to anger;
James 1-20 for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
James 1-21 Therefore <f>ⓚ</f>put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with <f>ⓛ</f>meekness the implanted word, <f>ⓜ</f>which is able to save your souls.
James 1-22 <pb/>But be <f>ⓝ</f>doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
James 1-23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.
James 1-24 For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.
James 1-25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, <f>ⓞ</f>the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, <f>ⓟ</f>he will be blessed in his doing.
James 1-26 <pb/>If anyone thinks he is religious <f>ⓠ</f>and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's <f>ⓡ</f>religion is worthless.
James 1-27 Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: <f>ⓢ</f>to visit <f>ⓣ</f>orphans and widows in their affliction, and <f>ⓤ</f>to keep oneself <f>ⓥ</f>unstained from the world.
