15-1 <pb/>After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: <f>ⓐ</f>“Fear not, Abram, I am <f>ⓑ</f>your shield; your reward shall be very great.”
15-2 But Abram said, “O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue <f>[1]</f> childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”
15-3 And Abram said, “Behold, you have given me no offspring, and <f>ⓒ</f>a member of my household will be my heir.”
15-4 And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: “This man shall not be your heir; <f>ⓓ</f>your very own son <f>[2]</f> shall be your heir.”
15-5 And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and <f>ⓔ</f>number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, <f>ⓕ</f>“So shall your offspring be.”
15-6 And <f>ⓖ</f>he believed the LORD, and <f>ⓗ</f>he counted it to him as righteousness.
15-7 <pb/>And he said to him, “I am the LORD who <f>ⓘ</f>brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans <f>ⓙ</f>to give you this land to possess.”
15-8 But he said, “O Lord GOD, <f>ⓚ</f>how am I to know that I shall possess it?”
15-9 He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”
15-10 And he brought him all these, <f>ⓛ</f>cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But <f>ⓜ</f>he did not cut the birds in half.
15-11 And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
15-12 <pb/>As the sun was going down, a <f>ⓝ</f>deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him.
15-13 Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain <f>ⓞ</f>that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and <f>ⓟ</f>they will be afflicted for <f>ⓠ</f>four hundred years.
15-14 But <f>ⓡ</f>I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward <f>ⓢ</f>they shall come out with great possessions.
15-15 As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; <f>ⓣ</f>you shall be buried in a good old age.
15-16 And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for <f>ⓤ</f>the iniquity of the Amorites <f>ⓥ</f>is not yet complete.”
15-17 <pb/>When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
15-18 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, <f>ⓦ</f>“To your offspring I give <f>[3]</f> this land, from <f>ⓧ</f>the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
15-19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
15-20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
15-21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites.”
13-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, <f>ⓑ</f>Abijah began to reign over Judah.
13-2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was <f>ⓒ</f>Micaiah <f>[1]</f> the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. <pb/><f>ⓓ</f>Now there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
13-3 Abijah went out to battle, having an army of valiant men of war, 400,000 chosen men. And Jeroboam <f>ⓔ</f>drew up his line of battle against him with 800,000 chosen mighty warriors.
13-4 Then Abijah stood up on Mount <f>ⓕ</f>Zemaraim that is in <f>ⓖ</f>the hill country of Ephraim and said, “Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel!
13-5 Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel <f>ⓗ</f>gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons by <f>ⓘ</f>a covenant of salt?
13-6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up <f>ⓙ</f>and rebelled against his lord,
13-7 and certain <f>ⓚ</f>worthless scoundrels <f>[2]</f> gathered about him and defied Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was <f>ⓛ</f>young and irresolute <f>[3]</f> and could not withstand them.
13-8 <pb/>“And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David, because you are a great multitude and have with you <f>ⓜ</f>the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods.
13-9 <f>ⓝ</f> Have you not driven out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves like the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes <f>ⓞ</f>for ordination <f>[4]</f> with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are <f>ⓟ</f>not gods.
13-10 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests ministering to the LORD who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service.
13-11 They offer to the LORD <f>ⓠ</f>every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices, set out <f>ⓡ</f>the showbread on the table of pure gold, <f>ⓢ</f>and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may <f>ⓣ</f>burn every evening. For we <f>ⓤ</f>keep the charge of the LORD our God, but you have forsaken him.
13-12 Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests <f>ⓥ</f>with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, <f>ⓦ</f>do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you cannot succeed.”
13-13 <pb/>Jeroboam had sent <f>ⓧ</f>an ambush around to come upon them from behind. Thus his troops <f>[5]</f> were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
13-14 And when Judah looked, behold, the battle was in front of and behind them. <f>ⓨ</f>And they cried to the LORD, and the priests <f>ⓩ</f>blew the trumpets.
13-15 Then the men of Judah raised the battle shout. And when the men of Judah shouted, <f>ⓐ</f>God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
13-16 The men of Israel fled before Judah, <f>ⓑ</f>and God gave them into their hand.
13-17 Abijah and his people struck them with great force, so there fell slain of Israel 500,000 chosen men.
13-18 Thus the men of Israel were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed, <f>ⓒ</f>because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.
13-19 And Abijah pursued Jeroboam <f>ⓓ</f>and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages and Jeshanah with its villages and <f>ⓔ</f>Ephron <f>[6]</f> with its villages.
13-20 Jeroboam did not recover his power in the days of Abijah. <f>ⓕ</f>And the LORD struck him down, <f>ⓖ</f>and he died.
13-21 But Abijah grew mighty. And he took fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
13-22 The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways and his sayings, are written in the <f>ⓗ</f>story of the prophet <f>ⓘ</f>Iddo.
66-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>“Heaven is my throne, </t><t>and the earth is my footstool; </t><t>what is the house that you would build for me, </t><t>and what is the place of my rest?</t>
66-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> All these things my hand has made, </t><t>and so all these things came to be, <pb/>declares the LORD. </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>But this is the one to whom I will look: </t><t>he who is humble and contrite in spirit </t><t>and trembles at my word. </t>
66-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man; </t><t>he who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; </t><t>he who presents a grain offering, like one who offers <f>ⓕ</f>pig's blood; </t><t>he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>These have chosen their own ways, </t><t>and their soul delights in their abominations;</t>
66-4 <t><f>ⓗ</f> I also will choose harsh treatment for them </t><t>and bring <f>ⓘ</f>their fears upon them, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>because when I called, no one answered, </t><t>when I spoke, they did not listen; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>but they did what was evil in my eyes </t><t>and chose that in which I did not delight.” </t>
66-5 <pb/><t>Hear the word of the LORD, </t><t>you who tremble at his word: </t><t>“Your brothers who hate you </t><t>and cast you out for my name's sake </t><t>have said, <f>ⓛ</f>‘Let the LORD be glorified, </t><t>that we may see your joy’; </t><t>but it is they who shall be put to shame. </t>
66-6 <pb/><t>“The sound of an uproar from the city! </t><t>A sound from the temple! </t><t>The sound of the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>rendering recompense to his enemies! </t>
66-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> “Before she was in labor </t><t>she gave birth; </t><t>before her pain came upon her </t><t>she delivered a son.</t>
66-8 <t>Who has heard such a thing? </t><t>Who has seen such things? </t><t>Shall a land be born in one day? </t><t>Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment? </t><t>For <f>ⓞ</f>as soon as Zion was in labor </t><t>she brought forth her children.</t>
66-9 <t>Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth?” </t><t>says the LORD; </t><t>“shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb?” </t><t>says your God. </t>
66-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, </t><t>all you who love her; </t><t>rejoice with her in joy, </t><t>all you who mourn over her;</t>
66-11 <t>that you may nurse and be satisfied </t><t>from her consoling breast; </t><t>that you may drink deeply with delight </t><t>from her glorious abundance.” <f>[1]</f> </t>
66-12 <pb/><t>For thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>“Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, </t><t>and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, </t><t>and bounced upon her knees.</t>
66-13 <t>As one whom his mother comforts, </t><t>so <f>ⓢ</f>I will comfort you; </t><t>you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</t>
66-14 <t>You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>your bones shall flourish like the grass; </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>the hand of the LORD shall be known to his servants, </t><t>and he shall show his indignation against his enemies. </t>
66-15 <pb/><t>“For behold, <f>ⓥ</f>the LORD will come in fire, </t><t>and <f>ⓦ</f>his chariots like the whirlwind, </t><t>to render his anger in fury, </t><t>and his rebuke with flames of fire.</t>
66-16 <t>For <f>ⓧ</f>by fire <f>ⓨ</f>will the LORD enter into judgment, </t><t>and by his sword, with all flesh; </t><t>and those slain by the LORD shall be many. </t>
66-17 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> “Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, <f>ⓐ</f>eating pig's flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the LORD.
66-18 <pb/>“For I know <f>[2]</f> their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory,
66-19 and I will set a sign among them. And from them <f>ⓒ</f>I will send survivors to the nations, to <f>ⓓ</f>Tarshish, <f>ⓔ</f>Pul, and <f>ⓕ</f>Lud, who draw the bow, to <f>ⓖ</f>Tubal and <f>ⓗ</f>Javan, <f>ⓘ</f>to the coastlands far away, <f>ⓙ</f>that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations.
66-20 <f>ⓚ</f> And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations <f>ⓛ</f>as an offering to the LORD, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.
66-21 <f>ⓜ</f> And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.
66-22 <pb/><t>“For as <f>ⓝ</f>the new heavens and the new earth </t><t>that I make </t><t>shall remain before me, says the LORD, </t><t>so <f>ⓞ</f>shall your offspring and your name remain.</t>
66-23 <t><f>ⓟ</f> From new moon to new moon, </t><t>and from Sabbath to Sabbath, </t><t>all flesh shall come to worship before me, </t><t>declares the LORD. </t>
66-24 <pb/>“And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For <f>ⓠ</f>their worm shall not die, <f>ⓡ</f>their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.”
4-1 <pb/>Masters, treat your bondservants <f>[1]</f> justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
4-2 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it <f>ⓑ</f>with thanksgiving.
4-3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God may <f>ⓒ</f>open to us a door for the word, <f>ⓓ</f>to declare the mystery of Christ, <f>ⓔ</f>on account of which I am in prison —
4-4 that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.
4-5 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Walk in wisdom toward <f>ⓖ</f>outsiders, making the best use of the time.
4-6 Let your speech always <f>ⓗ</f>be gracious, <f>ⓘ</f>seasoned with salt, <f>ⓙ</f>so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.
4-7 <pb/>Tychicus will tell you <f>ⓚ</f>all about my activities. He is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant <f>[2]</f> in the Lord.
4-8 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts,
4-9 and with him <f>ⓛ</f>Onesimus, our faithful and <f>ⓜ</f>beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you of everything that has taken place here.

4-12 <f>ⓣ</f> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you, always <f>ⓤ</f>struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand <f>ⓥ</f>mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
