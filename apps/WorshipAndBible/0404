39-1 <pb/>Now Joseph had been brought down to Egypt, and <f>ⓐ</f>Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, <f>ⓑ</f>had bought him from the <f>ⓒ</f>Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
39-2 <f>ⓓ</f> The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
39-3 His master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD <f>ⓔ</f>caused all that he did to succeed in his hands.
39-4 So Joseph <f>ⓕ</f>found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house <f>ⓖ</f>and put him in charge of all that he had.
39-5 From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house <f>ⓗ</f>for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had, in house and field.
39-6 So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge, and because of him he had no concern about anything but the food he ate. <pb/>Now Joseph was <f>ⓘ</f>handsome in form and appearance.
39-7 And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said, “Lie with me.”
39-8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, “Behold, because of me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and <f>ⓙ</f>he has put everything that he has in my charge.
39-9 He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept back anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and <f>ⓚ</f>sin against God?”
39-10 And as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he <f>ⓛ</f>would not listen to her, to lie beside her or to be with her.
39-11 <pb/>But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,
39-12 <f>ⓜ</f> she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out of the house.
39-13 And as soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled out of the house,
39-14 she called to the men of her household and said to them, “See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.
39-15 And as soon as he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garment beside me and fled and got out of the house.”
39-16 Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,
39-17 and she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to laugh at me.
39-18 But as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment beside me and fled out of the house.”
39-19 <pb/>As soon as his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, “This is the way your servant treated me,” his anger was kindled.
39-20 And Joseph's master took him and <f>ⓝ</f>put him into the <f>ⓞ</f>prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.
39-21 But <f>ⓟ</f>the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love <f>ⓠ</f>and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
39-22 And the keeper of the prison <f>ⓡ</f>put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.
39-23 The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph's charge, because <f>ⓢ</f>the LORD was with him. And whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed.
1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, <f>ⓑ</f>that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so <f>ⓒ</f>that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:
1-2 <pb/>“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and <f>ⓓ</f>he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
1-3 Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel — <f>ⓔ</f>he is the God who is in Jerusalem.
1-4 And let each survivor, in whatever place he sojourns, be assisted by the men of his place with silver and gold, with goods and with beasts, besides freewill offerings for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.”
1-5 <pb/>Then rose up the heads of the fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, <f>ⓕ</f>everyone whose spirit <f>ⓖ</f>God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem.
1-6 And all who were about them <f>ⓗ</f>aided them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with costly wares, besides all that was freely offered.
1-7 <f>ⓘ</f> Cyrus the king also brought out the vessels of the house of the LORD that <f>ⓙ</f>Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.
1-8 Cyrus king of Persia brought these out in the charge of <f>ⓚ</f>Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to <f>ⓛ</f>Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
1-9 And this was the number of them: <f>ⓜ</f>30 basins of gold, 1,000 basins of silver, 29 censers,
1-10 30 bowls of gold, 410 bowls of silver, and 1,000 other vessels;
1-11 all the vessels of gold and of silver were 5,400. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when the exiles were brought up from Babylonia to Jerusalem.
24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem <f>ⓑ</f>Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with <f>ⓒ</f>the officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers, and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me this vision: behold, <f>ⓓ</f>two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the LORD.
24-2 One basket had very good figs, <f>ⓔ</f>like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had <f>ⓕ</f>very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten.
24-3 And the LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”
24-4 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me:
24-5 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, <f>ⓖ</f>whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
24-6 <f>ⓗ</f> I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. <f>ⓘ</f>I will build them up, and not tear them down; <f>ⓙ</f>I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
24-7 <f>ⓚ</f> I will give them a heart to know that I am the LORD, <f>ⓛ</f>and they shall be my people <f>ⓜ</f>and I will be their God, <f>ⓝ</f>for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
24-8 <pb/>“But thus says the LORD: Like <f>ⓞ</f>the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat <f>ⓟ</f>Zedekiah the king of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who <f>ⓠ</f>dwell in the land of Egypt.
24-9 I will make them <f>ⓡ</f>a horror <f>[1]</f> to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be <f>ⓢ</f>a reproach, <f>ⓣ</f>a byword, <f>ⓤ</f>a taunt, and <f>ⓥ</f>a curse in all the places where I shall drive them.
24-10 And I will send <f>ⓦ</f>sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall be utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.”
2-1 <pb/>Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.
2-2 For since <f>ⓐ</f>the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and <f>ⓑ</f>every transgression or disobedience received a just <f>ⓒ</f>retribution,
2-3 <f>ⓓ</f> how shall we escape if we <f>ⓔ</f>neglect such a great salvation? It was <f>ⓕ</f>declared at first by the Lord, and it was <f>ⓖ</f>attested to us <f>ⓗ</f>by those who heard,
2-4 <f>ⓘ</f> while God also bore witness <f>ⓙ</f>by signs and wonders and various miracles and by <f>ⓚ</f>gifts of the Holy Spirit <f>ⓛ</f>distributed according to his will.
2-5 <pb/>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world <f>ⓜ</f>to come, of which we are speaking.
2-6 It has been testified somewhere, <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“What is man, that you are mindful of him, </t><t>or the son of man, that you care for him?</t>
2-7 <t>You made him for a little while lower than the angels; </t><t>you have crowned him with glory and honor, <f>[1]</f></t>
2-8 <t>putting everything in subjection under his feet.” </t> <pb/>Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, <f>ⓞ</f>we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.
2-9 But we see him <f>ⓟ</f>who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, <f>ⓠ</f>crowned with glory and honor <f>ⓡ</f>because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might <f>ⓢ</f>taste death <f>ⓣ</f>for everyone.
2-10 <pb/>For it <f>ⓤ</f>was fitting that he, <f>ⓥ</f>for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons <f>ⓦ</f>to glory, should make the <f>ⓧ</f>founder of their salvation <f>ⓨ</f>perfect through suffering.
2-11 For <f>ⓩ</f>he who sanctifies and <f>ⓐ</f>those who are sanctified <f>ⓑ</f>all have one source. <f>[2]</f> That is why he is not ashamed to call them <f>ⓒ</f>brothers, <f>[3]</f>
2-12 saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“I will tell of your name to my brothers; </t><t>in the midst of the <f>ⓔ</f>congregation I will sing your praise.” </t>
2-13 <pb/>And again, <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f>“I will put my trust in him.” </t> <pb/>And again, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“Behold, I and the children <f>ⓗ</f>God has given me.” </t>
2-14 <pb/>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise <f>ⓘ</f>partook of the same things, that <f>ⓙ</f>through death he might <f>ⓚ</f>destroy <f>ⓛ</f>the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
2-15 and deliver all those who <f>ⓜ</f>through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
2-16 For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he <f>ⓝ</f>helps the offspring of Abraham.
2-17 Therefore he had <f>ⓞ</f>to be made like his brothers in every respect, <f>ⓟ</f>so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest <f>ⓠ</f>in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
2-18 For because he himself has suffered <f>ⓡ</f>when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
