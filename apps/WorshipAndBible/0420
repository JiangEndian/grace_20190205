5-1 <pb/>Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold <f>ⓐ</f>a feast to me in the wilderness.’”
5-2 But Pharaoh said, <f>ⓑ</f>“Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and moreover, <f>ⓒ</f>I will not let Israel go.”
5-3 Then they said, “The <f>ⓓ</f>God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.”
5-4 But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your <f>ⓔ</f>burdens.”
5-5 And Pharaoh said, “Behold, <f>ⓕ</f>the people of the land are now many, <f>[1]</f> and you make them rest from their burdens!”
5-6 The same day Pharaoh commanded the <f>ⓖ</f>taskmasters of the people and their <f>ⓗ</f>foremen,
5-7 “You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
5-8 But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.’
5-9 Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.”
5-10 <pb/>So the <f>ⓘ</f>taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw.
5-11 Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.’”
5-12 So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
5-13 The <f>ⓙ</f>taskmasters were urgent, saying, “Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw.”
5-14 And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's <f>ⓚ</f>taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?”
5-15 <pb/>Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, “Why do you treat your servants like this?
5-16 No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.”
5-17 But he said, “You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’
5-18 Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.”
5-19 The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, “You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.”
5-20 They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh;
5-21 and <f>ⓛ</f>they said to them, “The LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”
5-22 <pb/>Then Moses turned to the LORD and said, “O Lord, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me?
5-23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all.”
7-1 <pb/>Now when the wall had been built <f>ⓐ</f>and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,
7-2 I gave <f>ⓑ</f>my brother Hanani and Hananiah the governor of <f>ⓒ</f>the castle charge over Jerusalem, for he was <f>ⓓ</f>a more faithful and God-fearing man than many.
7-3 And I said to them, “Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot. And while they are still standing guard, let them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, some at their guard posts and some in front of their own homes.”
7-4 The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few, and no houses had been rebuilt.
7-5 <pb/>Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles and the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of <f>ⓔ</f>those who came up at the first, and I found written in it:
7-6 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> These were the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of those exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his town.
7-7 They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, <f>ⓖ</f>Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. <pb/>The number of the men of the people of Israel:

7-45 The gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, 138.
7-46 <pb/>The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth,
7-47 the sons of Keros, the sons of <f>ⓤ</f>Sia, the sons of Padon,
7-48 the sons of Lebana, the sons of <f>ⓥ</f>Hagaba, the sons of <f>ⓦ</f>Shalmai,
7-49 the sons of Hanan, the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar,
7-50 the sons of Reaiah, the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda,
7-51 the sons of Gazzam, the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah,
7-52 the sons of Besai, the sons of Meunim, the sons of <f>ⓧ</f>Nephushesim,
7-53 the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur,
7-54 the sons of <f>ⓨ</f>Bazlith, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha,
7-55 the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Temah,
7-56 the sons of Neziah, the sons of Hatipha.
7-57 <pb/>The sons of Solomon's servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth, the sons of <f>ⓩ</f>Perida,
7-58 the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel,
7-59 the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of <f>ⓐ</f>Amon.
7-60 <pb/>All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon's servants were 392.
7-61 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, <f>ⓒ</f>Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their fathers' houses nor their descent, whether they belonged to Israel:
7-62 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642.
7-63 Also, of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai (who had taken a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name).
7-64 These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but it was not found there, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
7-65 <f>ⓓ</f> The <f>ⓔ</f>governor told them that they were not to partake of the most holy food until a priest with Urim and Thummim should arise.
7-66 <pb/>The whole assembly together was 42,360,
7-67 besides their male and female servants, of whom there were 7,337. And they had 245 singers, male and female.
7-68 Their horses were 736, their mules 245, <f>[1]</f>
7-69 their camels 435, and their donkeys 6,720.
7-70 <pb/>Now some of the heads of fathers' houses gave to the work. The <f>ⓕ</f>governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics <f>[2]</f> of gold, 50 basins, 30 priests' garments and 500 minas <f>[3]</f> of silver. <f>[4]</f>
7-71 And some of the heads of fathers' houses gave into the treasury of the work 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver.
7-72 <f>ⓖ</f> And what the rest of the people gave was 20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priests' garments.
7-73 <pb/>So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their towns. <pb/><f>ⓗ</f>And when the seventh month had come, the people of Israel were in their towns.
40-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD <f>ⓐ</f>after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from <f>ⓑ</f>Ramah, when he took him <f>ⓒ</f>bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
40-2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, <f>ⓓ</f>“The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place.
40-3 The LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said. <f>ⓔ</f>Because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you.
40-4 Now, behold, I release you today from <f>ⓕ</f>the chains on your hands. <f>ⓖ</f>If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, <f>ⓗ</f>but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. <f>ⓘ</f>See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go.
40-5 If you remain, <f>[1]</f> then return to <f>ⓙ</f>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, <f>ⓚ</f>whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go.
40-6 Then Jeremiah went to <f>ⓛ</f>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at <f>ⓜ</f>Mizpah, and lived with him <f>ⓝ</f>among the people <f>ⓞ</f>who were left in the land.
40-7 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that <f>ⓠ</f>the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of <f>ⓡ</f>the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon,
40-8 they went to Gedaliah at <f>ⓢ</f>Mizpah — <f>ⓣ</f>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, <f>ⓤ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, <f>ⓥ</f>Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
40-9 Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, <f>ⓦ</f>and it shall be well with you.
40-10 As for me, I will dwell at <f>ⓧ</f>Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you, <f>ⓨ</f>gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”
40-11 Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in <f>ⓩ</f>Moab and among <f>ⓐ</f>the Ammonites and in <f>ⓑ</f>Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them,
40-12 <f>ⓒ</f> then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they <f>ⓓ</f>gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.
40-13 <pb/>Now <f>ⓔ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓕ</f>all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
40-14 and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of <f>ⓖ</f>the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them.
40-15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered, <f>ⓗ</f>and the remnant of Judah would perish?”
40-16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael.”
5-1 <pb/>Come now, <f>ⓐ</f>you rich, weep and howl for the <f>ⓑ</f>miseries that are coming upon you.
5-2 <f>ⓒ</f> Your riches have rotted and <f>ⓓ</f>your garments are moth-eaten.
5-3 Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. <f>ⓔ</f>You have laid up treasure <f>ⓕ</f>in the last days.
5-4 Behold, <f>ⓖ</f>the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are crying out against you, and <f>ⓗ</f>the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of <f>ⓘ</f>the Lord of hosts.
5-5 <f>ⓙ</f> You have lived on the earth in luxury and <f>ⓚ</f>in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in <f>ⓛ</f>a day of slaughter.
5-6 You have condemned and <f>ⓜ</f>murdered <f>ⓝ</f>the righteous person. He does not resist you.
5-7 <pb/>Be patient, therefore, brothers, <f>[1]</f> until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives <f>ⓞ</f>the early and the late rains.
5-8 You also, be patient. <f>ⓟ</f>Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord <f>ⓠ</f>is at hand.
5-9 Do not grumble against one another, brothers, <f>ⓡ</f>so that you may not be judged; behold, <f>ⓢ</f>the Judge is standing <f>ⓣ</f>at the door.
5-10 As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take <f>ⓤ</f>the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
5-11 Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of <f>ⓥ</f>the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen <f>ⓦ</f>the purpose of the Lord, how <f>ⓧ</f>the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
5-12 <pb/>But above all, my brothers, <f>ⓨ</f>do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.
5-13 <pb/>Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him <f>ⓩ</f>sing praise.
5-14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, <f>ⓐ</f>anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
5-15 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And <f>ⓑ</f>if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
5-16 Therefore, <f>ⓒ</f>confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, <f>ⓓ</f>that you may be healed. <f>ⓔ</f>The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working. <f>[2]</f>
5-17 Elijah was a man <f>ⓕ</f>with a nature like ours, and <f>ⓖ</f>he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for <f>ⓗ</f>three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.
5-18 <f>ⓘ</f> Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit.
5-19 <pb/>My brothers, <f>ⓙ</f>if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone <f>ⓚ</f>brings him back,
5-20 let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering <f>ⓛ</f>will save his soul from death and <f>ⓜ</f>will cover a multitude of sins.
