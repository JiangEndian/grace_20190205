15-13 <pb/>According to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah, <f>ⓧ</f>Kiriath-arba, that is, <f>ⓨ</f>Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak).
15-14 And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak, <f>ⓩ</f>Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.
15-15 And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir. <f>ⓐ</f>Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.
15-16 And Caleb said, “Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.”
15-17 <f>ⓑ</f> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, <f>ⓒ</f>the brother of Caleb, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
15-18 When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she got off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”
15-19 She said to him, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water.” And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
