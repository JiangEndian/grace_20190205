Genesis 28-1 <pb/>Then Isaac called Jacob <f>ⓐ</f>and blessed him and directed him, <f>ⓑ</f>“You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women.
Genesis 28-2 <f>ⓒ</f> Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of <f>ⓓ</f>Bethuel your mother's father, and take as your wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.
Genesis 28-3 <f>ⓔ</f> God Almighty <f>[1]</f> bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.
Genesis 28-4 May he give <f>ⓕ</f>the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you, that you may take possession of <f>ⓖ</f>the land of your sojournings that God gave to Abraham!”
Genesis 28-5 Thus Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
Genesis 28-6 <pb/>Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he directed him, “You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,”
Genesis 28-7 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.
Genesis 28-8 So when Esau saw <f>ⓗ</f>that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father,
Genesis 28-9 Esau went to Ishmael and took as his wife, besides the wives he had, <f>ⓘ</f>Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of <f>ⓙ</f>Nebaioth.
Genesis 28-10 <pb/>Jacob left <f>ⓚ</f>Beersheba and went toward <f>ⓛ</f>Haran.
Genesis 28-11 And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.
Genesis 28-12 And he <f>ⓜ</f>dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder <f>[2]</f> set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, <f>ⓝ</f>the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!
Genesis 28-13 And behold, <f>ⓞ</f>the LORD stood above it <f>[3]</f> and said, <f>ⓟ</f>“I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. <f>ⓠ</f>The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring.
Genesis 28-14 Your offspring shall be like <f>ⓡ</f>the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and <f>ⓢ</f>your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis 28-15 Behold, <f>ⓣ</f>I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and <f>ⓤ</f>will bring you back to this land. For I will <f>ⓥ</f>not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”
Genesis 28-16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is <f>ⓦ</f>in this place, and I did not know it.”
Genesis 28-17 And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
Genesis 28-18 <pb/>So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up <f>ⓧ</f>for a pillar <f>ⓨ</f>and poured oil on the top of it.
Genesis 28-19 He called the name of that place <f>ⓩ</f>Bethel, <f>[4]</f> but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
Genesis 28-20 Then Jacob <f>ⓐ</f>made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,
Genesis 28-21 <f>ⓑ</f> so that I come again to my father's house in peace, <f>ⓒ</f>then the LORD shall be my God,
Genesis 28-22 and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, <f>ⓓ</f>shall be God's house. And <f>ⓔ</f>of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.”
2 Chronicles 26-1 <pb/>And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
2 Chronicles 26-2 He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
2 Chronicles 26-3 Uzziah was <f>ⓐ</f>sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 26-4 And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
2 Chronicles 26-5 He set himself to seek God <f>ⓑ</f>in the days of Zechariah, <f>ⓒ</f>who instructed him in the fear of God, and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him prosper.
2 Chronicles 26-6 <pb/>He went out and <f>ⓓ</f>made war against the Philistines and broke through the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in the territory of Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
2 Chronicles 26-7 God helped him <f>ⓔ</f>against the Philistines and against the Arabians who lived in Gurbaal and against the <f>ⓕ</f>Meunites.
2 Chronicles 26-8 The Ammonites <f>ⓖ</f>paid tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread even to the border of Egypt, for he became very strong.
2 Chronicles 26-9 Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at <f>ⓗ</f>the Corner Gate and at <f>ⓘ</f>the Valley Gate and at <f>ⓙ</f>the Angle, and fortified them.
2 Chronicles 26-10 And he built towers in the wilderness and <f>ⓚ</f>cut out many cisterns, for he had large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the plain, and he had farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
2 Chronicles 26-11 Moreover, Uzziah had an army of soldiers, fit for war, in divisions according to the numbers in the muster made by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer, under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's commanders.
2 Chronicles 26-12 The whole number of the heads of fathers' houses of mighty men of valor was 2,600.
2 Chronicles 26-13 Under their command was an army of <f>ⓛ</f>307,500, who could make war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
2 Chronicles 26-14 And Uzziah prepared for all the army shields, spears, helmets, <f>ⓜ</f>coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging.
2 Chronicles 26-15 In Jerusalem he made machines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his fame spread far, for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong.
2 Chronicles 26-16 <pb/>But when <f>ⓝ</f>he was strong, <f>ⓞ</f>he grew proud, to his destruction. For he was unfaithful to the LORD his God and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles 26-17 But <f>ⓟ</f>Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty priests of the LORD who were men of valor,
2 Chronicles 26-18 and they withstood King Uzziah and said to him, <f>ⓠ</f>“It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, <f>ⓡ</f>but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have done wrong, and it will bring you no honor from the LORD God.”
2 Chronicles 26-19 Then Uzziah was angry. Now he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and when he became angry with the priests, <f>ⓢ</f>leprosy <f>[1]</f> broke out on his forehead in the presence of the priests in the house of the LORD, by the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles 26-20 And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead! And they rushed him out quickly, and he himself hurried to go out, because the LORD had struck him.
2 Chronicles 26-21 <f>ⓣ</f> And King Uzziah was a leper to the day of his death, and being a leper lived <f>ⓤ</f>in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the LORD. And Jotham his son was over the king's household, governing the people of the land.
2 Chronicles 26-22 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, <f>ⓥ</f>Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz wrote.
2 Chronicles 26-23 And Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” And Jotham his son reigned in his place.
Jeremiah 13-1 <pb/>Thus says the LORD to me, “Go and buy a linen loincloth and <f>ⓐ</f>put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water.”
Jeremiah 13-2 So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD, and put it around my waist.
Jeremiah 13-3 And the word of the LORD came to me a second time,
Jeremiah 13-4 “Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, <f>ⓑ</f>go to the Euphrates and hide it there in <f>ⓒ</f>a cleft of the rock.”
Jeremiah 13-5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
Jeremiah 13-6 And after many days the LORD said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there <f>ⓓ</f>the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”
Jeremiah 13-7 Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took <f>ⓔ</f>the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was <f>ⓕ</f>spoiled; it was <f>ⓖ</f>good for nothing.
Jeremiah 13-8 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah 13-9 “Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓗ</f>Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great <f>ⓘ</f>pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 13-10 This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, <f>ⓙ</f>who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is <f>ⓚ</f>good for nothing.
Jeremiah 13-11 For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, <f>ⓛ</f>that they might be for me a people, <f>ⓜ</f>a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.
Jeremiah 13-12 <pb/>“You shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, “Every jar shall be filled with wine.”’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that <f>ⓝ</f>every jar will be filled with wine?’
Jeremiah 13-13 Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓞ</f>Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: <f>ⓟ</f>the kings who sit on David's throne, <f>ⓠ</f>the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 13-14 And I will <f>ⓡ</f>dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.’”
Jeremiah 13-15 <pb/><t>Hear and give ear; be not proud, </t><t>for the LORD has spoken.</t>
Jeremiah 13-16 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Give glory to the LORD your God </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>before he brings darkness, </t><t>before your feet stumble </t><t>on the twilight mountains, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>while you look for light </t><t>he turns it into gloom </t><t>and makes it <f>ⓥ</f>deep darkness.</t>
Jeremiah 13-17 <t>But if you will not listen, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>my soul will weep in secret for your pride; </t><t>my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, </t><t>because the LORD's flock has been taken captive. </t>
Jeremiah 13-18 <pb/><t>Say to <f>ⓧ</f>the king and <f>ⓨ</f>the queen mother: </t><t>“Take a lowly seat, </t><t>for <f>ⓩ</f>your beautiful crown </t><t>has come down from your head.”</t>
Jeremiah 13-19 <t><f>ⓐ</f> The cities of the Negeb are shut up, </t><t>with none to open them; </t><t>all Judah is taken into exile, </t><t>wholly taken into exile. </t>
Jeremiah 13-20 <pb/><t>“Lift up your eyes <f>ⓑ</f>and see </t><t>those who come from the north. </t><t>Where is the flock that was given you, </t><t>your beautiful flock?</t>
Jeremiah 13-21 <t>What will you say when they set as head over you </t><t>those whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you? </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>Will not pangs take hold of you </t><t>like those of a woman in labor?</t>
Jeremiah 13-22 <t>And if you say in your heart, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>‘Why have these things come upon me?’ </t><t>it is for the greatness of your iniquity </t><t>that <f>ⓔ</f>your skirts are lifted up </t><t>and you suffer violence.</t>
Jeremiah 13-23 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Can the Ethiopian change his skin </t><t>or <f>ⓖ</f>the leopard his spots? </t><t>Then also you can do good </t><t>who are accustomed to do evil.</t>
Jeremiah 13-24 <t>I will scatter you <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓗ</f>like chaff </t><t>driven by the wind from the desert.</t>
Jeremiah 13-25 <t><f>ⓘ</f> This is your lot, </t><t>the portion I have measured out to you, declares the LORD, </t><t>because <f>ⓙ</f>you have forgotten me </t><t>and trusted in lies.</t>
Jeremiah 13-26 <t><f>ⓚ</f> I myself will lift up your skirts over your face, </t><t>and your shame will be seen.</t>
Jeremiah 13-27 <t>I have seen <f>ⓛ</f>your abominations, </t><t>your adulteries and <f>ⓜ</f>neighings, your lewd whorings, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>on the hills in the field. </t><t>Woe to you, O Jerusalem! </t><t>How long will it be <f>ⓞ</f>before you are made clean?” </t>
1 Timothy 5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father, <f>ⓑ</f>younger men as brothers,
1 Timothy 5-2 older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.
1 Timothy 5-3 <pb/>Honor widows <f>ⓒ</f>who are truly widows.
1 Timothy 5-4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn <f>ⓓ</f>to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents, for <f>ⓔ</f>this is pleasing in the sight of God.
1 Timothy 5-5 She <f>ⓕ</f>who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on God and <f>ⓖ</f>continues in supplications and prayers night and day,
1 Timothy 5-6 but <f>ⓗ</f>she who is self-indulgent is <f>ⓘ</f>dead even while she lives.
1 Timothy 5-7 <f>ⓙ</f> Command these things as well, so that they may be without reproach.
1 Timothy 5-8 But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for <f>ⓚ</f>members of his household, he has <f>ⓛ</f>denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
1 Timothy 5-9 <pb/>Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age, having been <f>ⓜ</f>the wife of one husband, <f>[1]</f>
1 Timothy 5-10 and having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, has <f>ⓝ</f>shown hospitality, <f>ⓞ</f>has washed the feet of the saints, has <f>ⓟ</f>cared for the afflicted, and has <f>ⓠ</f>devoted herself to every good work.
1 Timothy 5-11 But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when <f>ⓡ</f>their passions draw them away from Christ, they desire to marry
1 Timothy 5-12 and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith.
1 Timothy 5-13 Besides that, they learn to be idlers, going about from house to house, and not only idlers, but also <f>ⓢ</f>gossips and <f>ⓣ</f>busybodies, saying what they should not.
1 Timothy 5-14 So I would have <f>ⓤ</f>younger widows marry, bear children, <f>ⓥ</f>manage their households, and <f>ⓦ</f>give the adversary no occasion for slander.
1 Timothy 5-15 <f>ⓧ</f> For some have already strayed after Satan.
1 Timothy 5-16 If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her care for them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those <f>ⓨ</f>who are truly widows.
1 Timothy 5-17 <pb/>Let the elders <f>ⓩ</f>who rule well be considered worthy of <f>ⓐ</f>double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.
1 Timothy 5-18 For the Scripture says, <f>ⓑ</f>“You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“The laborer deserves his wages.”</J>
1 Timothy 5-19 Do not admit a charge against an elder except <f>ⓓ</f>on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy 5-20 As for those who persist in sin, <f>ⓔ</f>rebuke them in the presence of all, <f>ⓕ</f>so that the rest may stand in fear.
1 Timothy 5-21 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels <f>ⓖ</f>I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, <f>ⓗ</f>doing nothing from partiality.
1 Timothy 5-22 <f>ⓘ</f> Do not be hasty in the <f>ⓙ</f>laying on of hands, nor <f>ⓚ</f>take part in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
1 Timothy 5-23 (No longer drink only water, but <f>ⓛ</f>use a little wine <f>ⓜ</f>for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.)
1 Timothy 5-24 The sins of some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear later.
1 Timothy 5-25 So also good works are conspicuous, and <f>ⓝ</f>even those that are not cannot remain hidden.
