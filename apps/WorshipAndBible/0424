Exodus 9-1 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓐ</f>“Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says <f>ⓑ</f>the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, “Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus 9-2 For if you refuse to let them go and still hold them,
Exodus 9-3 behold, <f>ⓒ</f>the hand of the LORD will fall with a very severe plague upon your livestock that are in the field, the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks.
Exodus 9-4 <f>ⓓ</f> But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing of all that belongs to the people of Israel shall die.”’”
Exodus 9-5 And the LORD set a time, saying, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.”
Exodus 9-6 And the next day the LORD did this thing. <f>ⓔ</f>All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one of the livestock of the people of Israel died.
Exodus 9-7 And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not one of the livestock of Israel was dead. But <f>ⓕ</f>the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
Exodus 9-8 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from the kiln, and let Moses throw them in the air in the sight of Pharaoh.
Exodus 9-9 It shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and become <f>ⓖ</f>boils breaking out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.”
Exodus 9-10 So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh. And Moses threw it in the air, and it became boils breaking out in sores on man and beast.
Exodus 9-11 And <f>ⓗ</f>the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils came upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.
Exodus 9-12 <f>ⓘ</f> But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, as <f>ⓙ</f>the LORD had spoken to Moses.
Exodus 9-13 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓚ</f>“Rise up early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, “Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus 9-14 For this time I will send all my plagues on you yourself, <f>[1]</f> and on your servants and your people, so <f>ⓛ</f>that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
Exodus 9-15 For by now I could have put out my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth.
Exodus 9-16 <f>ⓜ</f> But for this purpose I have raised you up, to show you my power, so <f>ⓝ</f>that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.
Exodus 9-17 <f>ⓞ</f> You are still exalting yourself against my people and will not let them go.
Exodus 9-18 Behold, about this time tomorrow I will cause very heavy hail to fall, such as never has been in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
Exodus 9-19 Now therefore send, <f>ⓟ</f>get your livestock and all that you have in the field into safe shelter, for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home will die when the hail falls on them.”’”
Exodus 9-20 Then whoever feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh hurried his slaves and his livestock into the houses,
Exodus 9-21 but whoever did not pay attention to the word of the LORD left his slaves and his livestock in the field.
Exodus 9-22 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that there may be <f>ⓠ</f>hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and beast and every plant of the field, in the land of Egypt.”
Exodus 9-23 Then Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the <f>ⓡ</f>LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. And the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus 9-24 There was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very heavy hail, such as had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
Exodus 9-25 The hail struck down everything that was in the field in all the land of Egypt, both man and beast. And the hail <f>ⓢ</f>struck down every plant of the field and broke every tree of the field.
Exodus 9-26 <f>ⓣ</f> Only in the land of Goshen, where the people of Israel were, was there no hail.
Exodus 9-27 <pb/>Then Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron and said to them, “This time <f>ⓤ</f>I have sinned; the <f>ⓥ</f>LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
Exodus 9-28 <f>ⓦ</f> Plead with the LORD, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.”
Exodus 9-29 Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, <f>ⓧ</f>I will stretch out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that <f>ⓨ</f>the earth is the LORD's.
Exodus 9-30 But as for you and your servants, <f>ⓩ</f>I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God.”
Exodus 9-31 (The flax and the barley were struck down, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.
Exodus 9-32 But the wheat and the emmer <f>[2]</f> were not struck down, for they are late in coming up.)
Exodus 9-33 So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and <f>ⓐ</f>stretched out his hands to the LORD, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth.
Exodus 9-34 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet again and <f>ⓑ</f>hardened his heart, <f>ⓒ</f>he and his servants.
Exodus 9-35 So <f>ⓓ</f>the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.
Nehemiah 11-1 <pb/>Now the leaders of the people <f>ⓐ</f>lived in Jerusalem. And the rest of the people <f>ⓑ</f>cast lots to bring one out of ten to live in Jerusalem <f>ⓒ</f>the holy city, while nine out of ten <f>[1]</f> remained in the other towns.

Nehemiah 11-24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's side <f>[4]</f> in all matters concerning the people.
Nehemiah 11-25 <pb/>And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in <f>ⓡ</f>Kiriath-arba and its villages, and in Dibon and its villages, and in Jekabzeel and its villages,

Jeremiah 44-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who lived in the land of Egypt, at <f>ⓐ</f>Migdol, at <f>ⓑ</f>Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of <f>ⓒ</f>Pathros,
Jeremiah 44-2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the disaster that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. Behold, this day <f>ⓓ</f>they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them,
Jeremiah 44-3 because of the evil that they committed, <f>ⓔ</f>provoking me to anger, <f>ⓕ</f>in that they went to make offerings <f>ⓖ</f>and serve other gods that they knew not, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.
Jeremiah 44-4 <f>ⓗ</f> Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, ‘Oh, do not do this abomination that I hate!’
Jeremiah 44-5 <f>ⓘ</f> But they did not listen <f>ⓙ</f>or incline their ear, to turn from their evil and make no offerings to other gods.
Jeremiah 44-6 <f>ⓚ</f> Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, <f>ⓛ</f>and they became a waste and a desolation, as at this day.
Jeremiah 44-7 And now thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil <f>ⓜ</f>against yourselves, to cut off from you <f>ⓝ</f>man and woman, <f>ⓞ</f>infant and child, from the midst of Judah, leaving you no remnant?
Jeremiah 44-8 <f>ⓟ</f> Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, <f>ⓠ</f>making offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live, so that you may be cut off and become <f>ⓡ</f>a curse and a taunt among all the nations of the earth?
Jeremiah 44-9 Have you forgotten the evil of your fathers, <f>ⓢ</f>the evil of the kings of Judah, <f>ⓣ</f>the evil of their <f>[1]</f> wives, your own evil, <f>ⓤ</f>and the evil of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah 44-10 They have not humbled themselves even to this day, <f>ⓥ</f>nor have they feared, nor walked in my law and my statutes that I set before you and before your fathers.
Jeremiah 44-11 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓦ</f>Behold, I will set my face against you for harm, to cut off all Judah.
Jeremiah 44-12 I will take the remnant of Judah who have <f>ⓧ</f>set their faces to come to the land of Egypt to live, and they shall all be consumed. <f>ⓨ</f>In the land of Egypt they shall fall; by the sword and by famine <f>ⓩ</f>they shall be consumed. <f>ⓐ</f>From the least to the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine, <f>ⓑ</f>and they shall become an oath, a horror, <f>ⓒ</f>a curse, and a taunt.
Jeremiah 44-13 <f>ⓓ</f> I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence,
Jeremiah 44-14 <f>ⓔ</f> so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive <f>ⓕ</f>or return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return to dwell there. For they shall not return, <f>ⓖ</f>except some fugitives.”
Jeremiah 44-15 <pb/>Then all the men who knew that <f>ⓗ</f>their wives had made offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who lived in <f>ⓘ</f>Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 44-16 “As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, <f>ⓙ</f>we will not listen to you.
Jeremiah 44-17 <f>ⓚ</f> But we will do everything that we have vowed, make offerings to <f>ⓛ</f>the queen of heaven <f>ⓜ</f>and pour out drink offerings to her, <f>ⓝ</f>as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our officials, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no disaster.
Jeremiah 44-18 But since we left off making offerings to <f>ⓞ</f>the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything <f>ⓟ</f>and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.”
Jeremiah 44-19 And the women said, <f>[2]</f> “When we made offerings to the queen of heaven <f>ⓠ</f>and poured out drink offerings to her, was it <f>ⓡ</f>without our husbands' approval that we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”
Jeremiah 44-20 <pb/>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, <f>ⓢ</f>men and women, all the people who had given him this answer:
Jeremiah 44-21 <f>ⓣ</f> “As for the offerings that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land, <f>ⓤ</f>did not the LORD remember them? Did it not come into his mind?
Jeremiah 44-22 <f>ⓥ</f> The LORD could no longer bear your evil deeds and <f>ⓦ</f>the abominations that you committed. <f>ⓧ</f>Therefore your land has become <f>ⓨ</f>a desolation and a waste and a curse, <f>ⓩ</f>without inhabitant, as it is this day.
Jeremiah 44-23 It is because you made offerings <f>ⓐ</f>and because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey the voice of the LORD or walk in his law and in his statutes and in his testimonies <f>ⓑ</f>that this disaster has happened to you, as at this day.”
Jeremiah 44-24 <pb/>Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
Jeremiah 44-25 Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓓ</f>You and your wives have declared with your mouths, and have fulfilled it with your hands, saying, ‘We will surely perform our vows that we have made, <f>ⓔ</f>to make offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Then confirm your vows and perform your vows!
Jeremiah 44-26 Therefore hear the word of the LORD, <f>ⓕ</f>all you of Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: <f>ⓖ</f>Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the LORD, <f>ⓗ</f>that my name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, <f>ⓘ</f>saying, ‘As the Lord GOD lives.’
Jeremiah 44-27 <f>ⓙ</f> Behold, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. <f>ⓚ</f>All the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them.
Jeremiah 44-28 <f>ⓛ</f> And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, <f>ⓜ</f>few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who came to the land of Egypt to live, <f>ⓝ</f>shall know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.
Jeremiah 44-29 This shall be the sign to you, declares the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, in order that you may know that <f>ⓞ</f>my words will surely stand against you for harm:
Jeremiah 44-30 Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will give <f>ⓟ</f>Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies <f>ⓠ</f>and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave <f>ⓡ</f>Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and sought his life.”
1 Peter 4-1 <pb/>Since therefore <f>ⓐ</f>Christ suffered in the flesh, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for <f>ⓒ</f>whoever has suffered in the flesh <f>ⓓ</f>has ceased from sin,
1 Peter 4-2 <f>ⓔ</f> so as to live for <f>ⓕ</f>the rest of the time in the flesh <f>ⓖ</f>no longer for human passions but <f>ⓗ</f>for the will of God.
1 Peter 4-3 For the time that is past <f>ⓘ</f>suffices <f>ⓙ</f>for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.
1 Peter 4-4 With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of <f>ⓚ</f>debauchery, and <f>ⓛ</f>they malign you;
1 Peter 4-5 but they will give account to him who is ready <f>ⓜ</f>to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter 4-6 For this is why <f>ⓝ</f>the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.
1 Peter 4-7 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> The end of all things is at hand; therefore <f>ⓟ</f>be self-controlled and sober-minded <f>ⓠ</f>for the sake of your prayers.
1 Peter 4-8 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since <f>ⓡ</f>love covers a multitude of sins.
1 Peter 4-9 <f>ⓢ</f> Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
1 Peter 4-10 <f>ⓣ</f> As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, <f>ⓤ</f>as good stewards of God's varied grace:
1 Peter 4-11 whoever speaks, as one who speaks <f>ⓥ</f>oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves <f>ⓦ</f>by the strength that God supplies — in order that in everything <f>ⓧ</f>God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. <f>ⓨ</f>To him belong glory and <f>ⓩ</f>dominion forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter 4-12 <pb/>Beloved, do not be surprised at <f>ⓐ</f>the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
1 Peter 4-13 But rejoice <f>ⓑ</f>insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad <f>ⓒ</f>when his glory is revealed.
1 Peter 4-14 <f>ⓓ</f> If you are insulted <f>ⓔ</f>for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory <f>[2]</f> and of God rests upon you.
1 Peter 4-15 But <f>ⓕ</f>let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or <f>ⓖ</f>as a meddler.
1 Peter 4-16 Yet <f>ⓗ</f>if anyone suffers as a <f>ⓘ</f>Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God <f>ⓙ</f>in that name.
1 Peter 4-17 For it is time for judgment <f>ⓚ</f>to begin at the household of God; and <f>ⓛ</f>if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who <f>ⓜ</f>do not obey the gospel of God?
1 Peter 4-18 And <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“If the righteous is scarcely saved, </t><t>what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?” <f>[3]</f> </t>
1 Peter 4-19 <pb/>Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will <f>ⓞ</f>entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.
