37-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood. Two cubits <f>[1]</f> and a half was its length, a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
37-2 And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of gold around it.
37-3 And he cast for it four rings of gold for its <f>ⓑ</f>four feet, two rings on its one side and two rings on its other side.
37-4 And he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold
37-5 and put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark.
37-6 And he made a mercy seat of pure gold. Two cubits and a half was its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth.
37-7 And he made two cherubim of gold. He made them of hammered work on the two ends of the mercy seat,
37-8 one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end. Of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim on its two ends.
37-9 The cherubim spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat were the faces of the cherubim.
37-10 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> He also made the table of acacia wood. Two cubits was its length, a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
37-11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold around it.
37-12 And he made a rim around it a handbreadth <f>[2]</f> wide, and made a molding of gold around the rim.
37-13 He cast for it four rings of gold and fastened the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
37-14 Close to the frame were the rings, as holders for the poles to carry the table.
37-15 He made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table, and overlaid them with gold.
37-16 And he made the vessels of pure gold that were to be on the table, its plates and dishes for incense, and its bowls and flagons with which to pour drink offerings.
37-17 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> He also made the lampstand of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work. Its base, its stem, its cups, its calyxes, and its flowers were of one piece with it.
37-18 And there were six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it;
37-19 three cups made like almond blossoms, each with calyx and flower, on one branch, and three cups made like almond blossoms, each with calyx and flower, on the other branch — so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
37-20 And on the lampstand itself were four cups made like almond blossoms, with their calyxes and flowers,
37-21 and a calyx of one piece with it under each pair of the six branches going out of it.
37-22 Their calyxes and their branches were of one piece with it. The whole of it was a single piece of hammered work of pure gold.
37-23 And he made its seven lamps and its tongs and its trays of pure gold.
37-24 He made it and all its utensils out of a talent <f>[3]</f> of pure gold.
37-25 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> He made the altar of incense of acacia wood. Its length was a cubit, and its breadth was a cubit. It was square, and two cubits was its height. Its horns were of one piece with it.
37-26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top and around its sides and its horns. And he made a molding of gold around it,
37-27 and made two rings of gold on it under its molding, on two opposite sides of it, as holders for the poles with which to carry it.
37-28 And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
37-29 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> He made the holy anointing oil also, and the <f>ⓖ</f>pure fragrant incense, blended as by the perfumer.
16-1 <pb/>Then Job answered and said:
16-2 <pb/><t>“I have heard <f>ⓐ</f>many such things; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>miserable comforters are you all.</t>
16-3 <t>Shall <f>ⓒ</f>windy words have an end? </t><t>Or what provokes you that you answer?</t>
16-4 <t>I also could speak as you do, </t><t>if you were in my place; </t><t>I could join words together against you </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>shake my head at you.</t>
16-5 <t>I could strengthen you with my mouth, </t><t>and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain. </t>
16-6 <pb/><t>“If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, </t><t>and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me?</t>
16-7 <t>Surely now God has worn me out; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>he has <f>[1]</f> made desolate all my company.</t>
16-8 <t>And he has shriveled me up, </t><t>which is <f>ⓕ</f>a witness against me, </t><t>and my <f>ⓖ</f>leanness has risen up against me; </t><t>it testifies to my face.</t>
16-9 <t>He has <f>ⓗ</f>torn me in his wrath <f>ⓘ</f>and hated me; </t><t>he has <f>ⓙ</f>gnashed his teeth at me; </t><t>my adversary sharpens his eyes against me.</t>
16-10 <t>Men have <f>ⓚ</f>gaped at me with their mouth; </t><t>they have <f>ⓛ</f>struck me insolently on the cheek; </t><t>they <f>ⓜ</f>mass themselves together against me.</t>
16-11 <t>God gives me up to the ungodly </t><t>and casts me into the hands of the wicked.</t>
16-12 <t>I was at ease, and he broke me apart; </t><t>he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; </t><t>he set me up as his <f>ⓝ</f>target;</t>
16-13 <t>his <f>ⓞ</f>archers surround me. </t><t>He slashes open my kidneys <f>ⓟ</f>and does not spare; </t><t>he <f>ⓠ</f>pours out my gall on the ground.</t>
16-14 <t>He breaks me with <f>ⓡ</f>breach upon breach; </t><t>he <f>ⓢ</f>runs upon me like a warrior.</t>
16-15 <t>I have sewed <f>ⓣ</f>sackcloth upon my skin </t><t>and have laid <f>ⓤ</f>my strength <f>ⓥ</f>in the dust.</t>
16-16 <t>My face is red with weeping, </t><t>and on my eyelids is <f>ⓦ</f>deep darkness,</t>
16-17 <t>although there is no <f>ⓧ</f>violence in my hands, </t><t>and my prayer is pure. </t>
16-18 <pb/><t>“O earth, <f>ⓨ</f>cover not my blood, </t><t>and let my <f>ⓩ</f>cry find no resting place.</t>
16-19 <t>Even now, behold, my <f>ⓐ</f>witness is in heaven, </t><t>and he who testifies for me is <f>ⓑ</f>on high.</t>
16-20 <t>My friends <f>ⓒ</f>scorn me; </t><t>my eye pours out tears to God,</t>
16-21 <t>that he would <f>ⓓ</f>argue the case of a man with God, </t><t>as <f>[2]</f> a son of man does with his neighbor.</t>
16-22 <t>For when a few years have come </t><t>I shall go the way <f>ⓔ</f>from which I shall not return. </t>
15-1 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
15-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, how does <f>ⓑ</f>the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest?
15-3 Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take <f>ⓒ</f>a peg from it to hang any vessel on it?
15-4 <f>ⓓ</f> Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything?
15-5 <f>ⓔ</f> Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything!
15-6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓕ</f>Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, <f>ⓖ</f>which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
15-7 <f>ⓗ</f> And I will set my face against them. Though <f>ⓘ</f>they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, <f>ⓙ</f>and you will know that I am the LORD, <f>ⓚ</f>when I set my face against them.
15-8 <f>ⓛ</f> And I will make the land desolate, because <f>ⓜ</f>they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord GOD.”
16-1 <pb/>Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling <f>ⓐ</f>the seven angels, “Go and <f>ⓑ</f>pour out on the earth <f>ⓒ</f>the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”
16-2 <pb/>So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful <f>ⓓ</f>sores came upon the people who bore <f>ⓔ</f>the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
16-3 <pb/>The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and <f>ⓕ</f>it became like the blood of a corpse, and <f>ⓖ</f>every living thing died that was in the sea.
16-4 <pb/>The third angel poured out his bowl into <f>ⓗ</f>the rivers and the springs of water, and <f>ⓘ</f>they became blood.
16-5 And I heard the angel in charge of the waters <f>[1]</f> say, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“Just are you, <f>ⓚ</f>O Holy One, <f>ⓛ</f>who is and who was, </t><t>for you brought these judgments.</t>
16-6 <t>For <f>ⓜ</f>they have shed the blood of <f>ⓝ</f>saints and prophets, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>you have given them blood to drink. </t><t>It is what they deserve!” </t>
16-7 <pb/>And I heard <f>ⓟ</f>the altar saying, <pb/><t>“Yes, Lord God the Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>true and just are your judgments!” </t>
16-8 <pb/>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people <f>ⓡ</f>with fire.
16-9 They were scorched by the fierce heat, and <f>ⓢ</f>they cursed <f>[2]</f> the name of God who had power over these plagues. <f>ⓣ</f>They did not repent <f>ⓤ</f>and give him glory.
16-10 <pb/>The fifth angel poured out his bowl on <f>ⓥ</f>the throne of the beast, and <f>ⓦ</f>its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish
16-11 and cursed <f>ⓧ</f>the God of heaven for their pain and <f>ⓨ</f>sores. <f>ⓩ</f>They did not repent of their deeds.
16-12 <pb/>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on <f>ⓐ</f>the great river Euphrates, and <f>ⓑ</f>its water was dried up, <f>ⓒ</f>to prepare the way for the kings <f>ⓓ</f>from the east.
16-13 And I saw, coming out of the mouth of <f>ⓔ</f>the dragon and out of the mouth of <f>ⓕ</f>the beast and out of the mouth of <f>ⓖ</f>the false prophet, three <f>ⓗ</f>unclean spirits like <f>ⓘ</f>frogs.
16-14 For they are <f>ⓙ</f>demonic spirits, <f>ⓚ</f>performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, <f>ⓛ</f>to assemble them for battle on <f>ⓜ</f>the great day of God the Almighty.
16-15 <J>(“Behold, <f>ⓝ</f>I am coming like a thief! <f>ⓞ</f>Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, <f>ⓟ</f>that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!”)</J>
16-16 And <f>ⓠ</f>they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called <f>ⓡ</f>Armageddon.
16-17 <pb/>The seventh angel poured out his bowl into <f>ⓢ</f>the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, <f>ⓣ</f>“It is done!”
16-18 And there were <f>ⓤ</f>flashes of lightning, rumblings, <f>[3]</f> peals of thunder, and <f>ⓥ</f>a great earthquake <f>ⓦ</f>such as there had never been since man was on the earth, so great was that earthquake.
16-19 <f>ⓧ</f> The great city <f>ⓨ</f>was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God <f>ⓩ</f>remembered <f>ⓐ</f>Babylon the great, <f>ⓑ</f>to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.
16-20 And <f>ⓒ</f>every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found.
16-21 And <f>ⓓ</f>great hailstones, about one hundred pounds <f>[4]</f> each, fell from heaven on people; and <f>ⓔ</f>they cursed God for <f>ⓕ</f>the plague of the hail, because the plague was so severe.
