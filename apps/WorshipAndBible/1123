2 Samuel 5-1 <pb/>Then all the tribes of Israel <f>ⓐ</f>came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, <f>ⓑ</f>we are your bone and flesh.
2 Samuel 5-2 In times past, when Saul was king over us, <f>ⓒ</f>it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD said to you, <f>ⓓ</f>‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince <f>[1]</f> over Israel.’”
2 Samuel 5-3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, <f>ⓔ</f>and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron <f>ⓕ</f>before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.
2 Samuel 5-4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and <f>ⓖ</f>he reigned forty years.
2 Samuel 5-5 <f>ⓗ</f> At Hebron he reigned over Judah <f>ⓘ</f>seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years. <f>[2]</f>
2 Samuel 5-6 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem <f>ⓚ</f>against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, “You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will ward you off” — thinking, “David cannot come in here.”
2 Samuel 5-7 Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, <f>ⓛ</f>that is, the city of David.
2 Samuel 5-8 And David said on that day, “Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack ‘the lame and the blind,’ who are hated by David's soul.” Therefore it is said, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”
2 Samuel 5-9 And David lived in the stronghold and called it <f>ⓜ</f>the city of David. And David built the city all around from the <f>ⓝ</f>Millo inward.
2 Samuel 5-10 And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.
2 Samuel 5-11 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> And <f>ⓟ</f>Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also carpenters and masons who built David a house.
2 Samuel 5-12 And David knew that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
2 Samuel 5-13 <pb/>And David took more <f>ⓠ</f>concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David.
2 Samuel 5-14 <f>ⓡ</f> And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
2 Samuel 5-15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
2 Samuel 5-16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2 Samuel 5-17 <pb/>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went down <f>ⓢ</f>to the stronghold.
2 Samuel 5-18 Now the Philistines had come and spread out in <f>ⓣ</f>the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel 5-19 And David <f>ⓤ</f>inquired of the LORD, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?” And the LORD said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand.”
2 Samuel 5-20 And David came to Baal-perazim, and David defeated them there. And he said, “The LORD has broken through my enemies before me like a breaking flood.” <f>ⓥ</f>Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim. <f>[3]</f>
2 Samuel 5-21 And the Philistines left their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.
2 Samuel 5-22 <pb/>And the Philistines came up yet again <f>ⓦ</f>and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel 5-23 <f>ⓧ</f> And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, “You shall not go up; go around to their rear, and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
2 Samuel 5-24 And <f>ⓨ</f>when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then rouse yourself, <f>ⓩ</f>for then the LORD has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”
2 Samuel 5-25 And David did as the LORD commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba <f>ⓐ</f>to Gezer.

John 5-1 <pb/>After this there was a <f>ⓐ</f>feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John 5-2 <pb/>Now there is in Jerusalem by <f>ⓑ</f>the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic <f>[1]</f> called Bethesda, <f>[2]</f> which has five roofed colonnades.
John 5-3 In these lay a multitude of invalids — blind, lame, and <f>ⓒ</f>paralyzed. <f>[3]</f>
John 5-4 
John 5-5 One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
John 5-6 When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, <J>“Do you want to be healed?”</J>
John 5-7 The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.”
John 5-8 Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Get up, take up your bed, and walk.”</J>
John 5-9 <f>ⓔ</f> And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked. <pb/><f>ⓕ</f>Now that day was the Sabbath.
John 5-10 So the Jews <f>[4]</f> said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and <f>ⓖ</f>it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.”
John 5-11 But he answered them, “The man who healed me, that man said to me, <J>‘Take up your bed, and walk.’</J>”
John 5-12 They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?”
John 5-13 Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for <f>ⓗ</f>Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.
John 5-14 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, <J>“See, you are well! <f>ⓘ</f>Sin no more, <f>ⓙ</f>that nothing worse may happen to you.”</J>
John 5-15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.
John 5-16 And this was why the Jews <f>ⓚ</f>were persecuting Jesus, <f>ⓛ</f>because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
John 5-17 But Jesus answered them, <J>“My Father is working until now, and I am working.”</J>
John 5-18 <pb/>This was why the Jews <f>ⓜ</f>were seeking all the more to kill him, <f>ⓝ</f>because not only was he <f>ⓞ</f>breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God <f>ⓟ</f>his own Father, <f>ⓠ</f>making himself equal with God.
John 5-19 <pb/>So Jesus said to them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓡ</f>the Son <f>ⓢ</f>can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father <f>[5]</f> does, that the Son does likewise.</J>
John 5-20 <J>For <f>ⓣ</f>the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And <f>ⓤ</f>greater works than these will he show him, so that <f>ⓥ</f>you may marvel.</J>
John 5-21 <J>For as the Father <f>ⓦ</f>raises the dead and <f>ⓧ</f>gives them life, so <f>ⓨ</f>also the Son gives life <f>ⓩ</f>to whom he will.</J>
John 5-22 <J><f>ⓐ</f> For the Father judges no one, but <f>ⓑ</f>has given all judgment to the Son,</J>
John 5-23 <J>that all may honor the Son, just as they <f>ⓒ</f>honor the Father. <f>ⓓ</f>Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</J>
John 5-24 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓔ</f>whoever hears my word and <f>ⓕ</f>believes him who sent me has eternal life. He <f>ⓖ</f>does not come into judgment, but <f>ⓗ</f>has passed from death to life.</J>
John 5-25 <pb/><J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓘ</f>an hour is coming, and is now here, when <f>ⓙ</f>the dead will hear <f>ⓚ</f>the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear <f>ⓛ</f>will live.</J>
John 5-26 <J><f>ⓜ</f> For as the Father has life in himself, <f>ⓝ</f>so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.</J>
John 5-27 <J>And he <f>ⓞ</f>has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</J>
John 5-28 <J>Do not marvel at this, for <f>ⓟ</f>an hour is coming when <f>ⓠ</f>all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</J>
John 5-29 <J>and come out, <f>ⓡ</f>those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.</J>
John 5-30 <pb/><J><f>ⓢ</f> “I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and <f>ⓣ</f>my judgment is just, because <f>ⓤ</f>I seek not my own will <f>ⓥ</f>but the will of him who sent me.</J>
John 5-31 <J><f>ⓦ</f> If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true.</J>
John 5-32 <J>There is <f>ⓧ</f>another who bears witness about me, and <f>ⓨ</f>I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true.</J>
John 5-33 <J><f>ⓩ</f> You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</J>
John 5-34 <J>Not that <f>ⓐ</f>the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.</J>
John 5-35 <J>He was a burning and <f>ⓑ</f>shining lamp, and <f>ⓒ</f>you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</J>
John 5-36 <J>But <f>ⓓ</f>the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For <f>ⓔ</f>the works that the Father has given me <f>ⓕ</f>to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, <f>ⓖ</f>bear witness about me that <f>ⓗ</f>the Father has sent me.</J>
John 5-37 <J>And the Father who sent me <f>ⓘ</f>has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, <f>ⓙ</f>his form you have never seen,</J>
John 5-38 <J>and <f>ⓚ</f>you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent.</J>
John 5-39 <J><f>ⓛ</f> You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and <f>ⓜ</f>it is they that bear witness about me,</J>
John 5-40 <J>yet <f>ⓝ</f>you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</J>
John 5-41 <J><f>ⓞ</f> I do not receive glory from people.</J>
John 5-42 <J>But <f>ⓟ</f>I know that you do not have <f>ⓠ</f>the love of God within you.</J>
John 5-43 <J>I have come <f>ⓡ</f>in my Father's name, and <f>ⓢ</f>you do not receive me. <f>ⓣ</f>If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.</J>
John 5-44 <J>How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and <f>ⓤ</f>do not seek the glory that comes from <f>ⓥ</f>the only God?</J>
John 5-45 <J>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, <f>ⓦ</f>on whom you have set your hope.</J>
John 5-46 <J>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for <f>ⓧ</f>he wrote of me.</J>
John 5-47 <J>But <f>ⓨ</f>if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?”</J>
