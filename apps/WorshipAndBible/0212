15-1 <pb/>David <f>[1]</f> built houses for himself in the city of David. And he prepared a place for the ark of God and <f>ⓐ</f>pitched a tent for it.
15-2 Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry <f>ⓑ</f>the ark of God, for the LORD had chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister to him forever.
15-3 <f>ⓒ</f> And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD <f>ⓓ</f>to its place, which he had prepared for it.
15-4 And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and <f>ⓔ</f>the Levites:
15-5 of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 of his brothers;
15-6 of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 of his brothers;
15-7 of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 of his brothers;
15-8 of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 of his brothers;
15-9 of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 of his brothers;
15-10 of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 of his brothers.
15-11 Then David summoned the priests <f>ⓕ</f>Zadok and <f>ⓖ</f>Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,
15-12 and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites. <f>ⓗ</f>Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓘ</f>to the place that I have prepared for it.
15-13 <f>ⓙ</f> Because you did not carry it the first time, the LORD our God broke out against us, because we did not seek him according to the rule.”
15-14 So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.
15-15 And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders <f>ⓚ</f>with the poles, <f>ⓛ</f>as Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD.
15-16 <pb/>David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers who should play loudly on <f>ⓜ</f>musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.
15-17 So the Levites appointed <f>ⓝ</f>Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers <f>ⓞ</f>Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brothers, <f>ⓟ</f>Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
15-18 and with them their brothers of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
15-19 The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals;
15-20 Zechariah, <f>ⓠ</f>Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to <f>ⓡ</f>Alamoth;
15-21 but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, <f>ⓢ</f>Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to <f>ⓣ</f>the Sheminith.
15-22 Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it.
15-23 Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
15-24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, should <f>ⓤ</f>blow the trumpets before the ark of God. <f>ⓥ</f>Obed-edom and Jehiah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
15-25 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of <f>ⓧ</f>Obed-edom with rejoicing.
15-26 And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they sacrificed <f>ⓨ</f>seven bulls and seven rams.
15-27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers. And David wore a linen ephod.
15-28 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, to the sound of the horn, <f>ⓩ</f>trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on <f>ⓐ</f>harps and lyres.
15-29 <pb/>And as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.
39-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, <f>ⓑ</f>sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
39-2 And Hezekiah welcomed them gladly. And he showed them his treasure house, <f>ⓒ</f>the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his whole armory, all that was found in his storehouses. <f>ⓓ</f>There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
39-3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?” Hezekiah said, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.”
39-4 He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
39-5 <pb/>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
39-6 <f>ⓔ</f> Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
39-7 <f>ⓕ</f> And some of your own sons, who will come from you, whom you will father, shall be taken away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
39-8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, <f>ⓖ</f>“There will be peace and security in my days.”
5-1 <pb/>For we know that if <f>ⓐ</f>the tent that is <f>ⓑ</f>our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, <f>ⓒ</f>a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
5-2 For in this tent <f>ⓓ</f>we groan, longing to <f>ⓔ</f>put on our heavenly dwelling,
5-3 if indeed by putting it on <f>[1]</f> we may not be found naked.
5-4 For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened — not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal <f>ⓕ</f>may be swallowed up by life.
5-5 He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, <f>ⓖ</f>who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
5-6 <pb/>So we are always of good courage. We know that <f>ⓗ</f>while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,
5-7 for <f>ⓘ</f>we walk by faith, not <f>ⓙ</f>by sight.
5-8 Yes, we are of good courage, and we <f>ⓚ</f>would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
5-9 So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to <f>ⓛ</f>please him.
5-10 For <f>ⓜ</f>we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, <f>ⓝ</f>so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.
5-11 <pb/>Therefore, knowing <f>ⓞ</f>the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But <f>ⓟ</f>what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.
5-12 <f>ⓠ</f> We are not commending ourselves to you again but <f>ⓡ</f>giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart.
5-13 For if we <f>ⓢ</f>are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
5-14 For the love of Christ <f>ⓣ</f>controls us, because we have concluded this: that <f>ⓤ</f>one has died for all, therefore all have died;
5-15 and he died for all, <f>ⓥ</f>that those who live might no longer live for themselves but <f>ⓦ</f>for him who for their sake died and was raised.
5-16 <pb/>From now on, therefore, <f>ⓧ</f>we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.
5-17 Therefore, if anyone is <f>ⓨ</f>in Christ, he is <f>ⓩ</f>a new creation. <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
5-18 All this is from God, <f>ⓑ</f>who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us <f>ⓒ</f>the ministry of reconciliation;
5-19 that is, in Christ God was reconciling <f>[3]</f> the world to himself, <f>ⓓ</f>not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us <f>ⓔ</f>the message of reconciliation.
5-20 Therefore, <f>ⓕ</f>we are ambassadors for Christ, <f>ⓖ</f>God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
5-21 <f>ⓗ</f> For our sake he made him to be sin <f>ⓘ</f>who knew no sin, so that in him we might become <f>ⓙ</f>the righteousness of God.
