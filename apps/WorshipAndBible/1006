Judges 13-1 <pb/>And the people of Israel again <f>ⓐ</f>did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, so the LORD gave them <f>ⓑ</f>into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.
Judges 13-2 <pb/>There was a certain man of <f>ⓒ</f>Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. <f>ⓓ</f>And his wife was barren and had no children.
Judges 13-3 <f>ⓔ</f> And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold, you are barren and have not borne children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.
Judges 13-4 Therefore be careful <f>ⓕ</f>and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean,
Judges 13-5 for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. <f>ⓖ</f>No razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be <f>ⓗ</f>a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall <f>ⓘ</f>begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”
Judges 13-6 Then the woman came and told her husband, <f>ⓙ</f>“A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. <f>ⓚ</f>I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name,
Judges 13-7 but he said to me, <f>ⓛ</f>‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’”
Judges 13-8 <pb/>Then Manoah prayed to the LORD and said, “O Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do with the child who will be born.”
Judges 13-9 And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. But Manoah her husband was not with her.
Judges 13-10 So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.”
Judges 13-11 And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to this woman?” And he said, “I am.”
Judges 13-12 And Manoah said, “Now when your words come true, <f>ⓜ</f>what is to be the child's manner of life, and what is his mission?”
Judges 13-13 And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful.
Judges 13-14 She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine, <f>ⓝ</f>neither let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.”
Judges 13-15 <pb/>Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “Please let us detain you and <f>ⓞ</f>prepare a young goat for you.”
Judges 13-16 And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “If you detain me, I will not eat of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the LORD.” (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the LORD.)
Judges 13-17 And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, <f>ⓟ</f>“What is your name, so that, when your words come true, we may honor you?”
Judges 13-18 And the angel of the LORD said to him, <f>ⓠ</f>“Why do you ask my name, seeing <f>ⓡ</f>it is wonderful?”
Judges 13-19 So <f>ⓢ</f>Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the LORD, to the one who works <f>[1]</f> wonders, and Manoah and his wife were watching.
Judges 13-20 And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the LORD went up in the flame of the altar. Now Manoah and his wife were watching, <f>ⓣ</f>and they fell on their faces to the ground.
Judges 13-21 <pb/>The angel of the LORD appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife. <f>ⓤ</f>Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.
Judges 13-22 And Manoah said to his wife, <f>ⓥ</f>“We shall surely die, for we have seen God.”
Judges 13-23 But his wife said to him, “If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these.”
Judges 13-24 And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. <f>ⓦ</f>And the young man grew, and the LORD blessed him.
Judges 13-25 <f>ⓧ</f> And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between <f>ⓨ</f>Zorah and Eshtaol.

Matthew 25-1 <pb/><J>“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like <f>ⓐ</f>ten virgins who took their lamps <f>[1]</f> and went to meet <f>ⓑ</f>the bridegroom. <f>[2]</f></J>
Matthew 25-2 <J>Five of them were foolish, and five were <f>ⓒ</f>wise.</J>
Matthew 25-3 <J>For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,</J>
Matthew 25-4 <J>but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.</J>
Matthew 25-5 <J>As the bridegroom <f>ⓓ</f>was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.</J>
Matthew 25-6 <J>But <f>ⓔ</f>at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’</J>
Matthew 25-7 <J>Then all those virgins rose and <f>ⓕ</f>trimmed their lamps.</J>
Matthew 25-8 <J>And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’</J>
Matthew 25-9 <J>But the wise answered, saying, ‘Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’</J>
Matthew 25-10 <J>And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and <f>ⓖ</f>those who were ready went in with him to <f>ⓗ</f>the marriage feast, and <f>ⓘ</f>the door was shut.</J>
Matthew 25-11 <J>Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>‘Lord, lord, open to us.’</J>
Matthew 25-12 <J><f>ⓚ</f> But he answered, ‘Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓛ</f>I do not know you.’</J>
Matthew 25-13 <J><f>ⓜ</f> Watch therefore, for you <f>ⓝ</f>know neither the day nor the hour.</J>
Matthew 25-14 <pb/><J><f>ⓞ</f> “For <f>ⓟ</f>it will be like a man <f>ⓠ</f>going on a journey, who called his servants <f>[3]</f> and entrusted to them his property.</J>
Matthew 25-15 <J>To one he gave five <f>ⓡ</f>talents, <f>[4]</f> to another two, to another one, <f>ⓢ</f>to each according to his ability. Then he <f>ⓣ</f>went away.</J>
Matthew 25-16 <J>He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more.</J>
Matthew 25-17 <J>So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.</J>
Matthew 25-18 <J>But he who had received the one talent went and <f>ⓤ</f>dug in the ground and hid his master's money.</J>
Matthew 25-19 <J>Now <f>ⓥ</f>after a long time the master of those servants came and <f>ⓦ</f>settled accounts with them.</J>
Matthew 25-20 <J>And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.’</J>
Matthew 25-21 <J>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and <f>ⓧ</f>faithful servant. <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓨ</f>You have been faithful over a little; <f>ⓩ</f>I will set you over much. Enter into <f>ⓐ</f>the joy of your master.’</J>
Matthew 25-22 <J>And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.’</J>
Matthew 25-23 <J>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’</J>
Matthew 25-24 <J>He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be <f>ⓑ</f>a hard man, reaping <f>ⓒ</f>where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,</J>
Matthew 25-25 <J>so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, <f>ⓓ</f>you have what is yours.’</J>
Matthew 25-26 <J>But his master answered him, ‘You <f>ⓔ</f>wicked and <f>ⓕ</f>slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed?</J>
Matthew 25-27 <J>Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest.</J>
Matthew 25-28 <J>So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.</J>
Matthew 25-29 <J><f>ⓖ</f> For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</J>
Matthew 25-30 <J>And <f>ⓗ</f>cast <f>ⓘ</f>the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place <f>ⓙ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</J>
Matthew 25-31 <pb/><J><f>ⓚ</f> “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, <f>ⓛ</f>then he will sit on his glorious throne.</J>
Matthew 25-32 <J>Before him <f>ⓜ</f>will be gathered <f>ⓝ</f>all the nations, and <f>ⓞ</f>he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates <f>ⓟ</f>the sheep from the goats.</J>
Matthew 25-33 <J>And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.</J>
Matthew 25-34 <J>Then <f>ⓠ</f>the King will say to <f>ⓡ</f>those on his right, ‘Come, you <f>ⓢ</f>who are blessed by my Father, <f>ⓣ</f>inherit <f>ⓤ</f>the kingdom <f>ⓥ</f>prepared for you <f>ⓦ</f>from the foundation of the world.</J>

Matthew 25-36 <J><f>ⓐ</f> I was naked and you clothed me, <f>ⓑ</f>I was sick and you <f>ⓒ</f>visited me, <f>ⓓ</f>I was in prison and you came to me.’</J>
Matthew 25-37 <J>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</J>
Matthew 25-38 <J>And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?</J>
Matthew 25-39 <J>And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’</J>
Matthew 25-40 <J>And <f>ⓔ</f>the King will answer them, <f>ⓕ</f>‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these <f>ⓖ</f>my brothers, <f>[6]</f> you did it to me.’</J>
Matthew 25-41 <pb/><J>“Then he will say to those on his left, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Depart from me, you <f>ⓘ</f>cursed, into <f>ⓙ</f>the eternal fire prepared for <f>ⓚ</f>the devil and his angels.</J>

Matthew 25-43 <J>I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’</J>
Matthew 25-44 <J>Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’</J>
Matthew 25-45 <J>Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, <f>ⓜ</f>you did not do it to me.’</J>
Matthew 25-46 <J>And these will go away <f>ⓝ</f>into eternal punishment, but the righteous <f>ⓞ</f>into <f>ⓟ</f>eternal life.”</J>
