Exodus 21-1 <pb/>“Now these are the <f>ⓐ</f>rules that you shall set before them.
Exodus 21-2 <f>ⓑ</f> When you buy a Hebrew slave, <f>[1]</f> he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing.
Exodus 21-3 If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him.
Exodus 21-4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone.
Exodus 21-5 But <f>ⓒ</f>if the slave plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’
Exodus 21-6 then his master shall bring him to <f>ⓓ</f>God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.
Exodus 21-7 <pb/>“When a man <f>ⓔ</f>sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do.

Exodus 21-9 If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter.
Exodus 21-10 If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or <f>ⓕ</f>her marital rights.

Exodus 21-12 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> “Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall be put to death.

Exodus 21-14 But if a man willfully attacks another to kill him by cunning, <f>ⓙ</f>you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.
Exodus 21-15 <pb/>“Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death.

Exodus 21-17 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> “Whoever curses <f>[3]</f> his father or his mother shall be put to death.
Exodus 21-18 <pb/>“When men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist and the man does not die but takes to his bed,
Exodus 21-19 then if the man rises again and walks outdoors with his staff, he who struck him shall be clear; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall have him thoroughly healed.
Exodus 21-20 <pb/>“When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be avenged.
Exodus 21-21 But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be avenged, for the <f>ⓝ</f>slave is his money.
Exodus 21-22 <pb/>“When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and <f>ⓞ</f>he shall pay as the <f>ⓟ</f>judges determine.
Exodus 21-23 But if there is harm, <f>[4]</f> then you shall pay <f>ⓠ</f>life for life,
Exodus 21-24 <f>ⓡ</f> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
Exodus 21-25 burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
Exodus 21-26 <pb/>“When a man strikes the eye of his slave, male or female, and destroys it, he shall let the slave go free because of his eye.
Exodus 21-27 If he knocks out the tooth of his slave, male or female, he shall let the slave go free because of his tooth.
Exodus 21-28 <pb/>“When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the <f>ⓢ</f>ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall not be liable.
Exodus 21-29 But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
Exodus 21-30 If <f>ⓣ</f>a ransom is imposed on him, then <f>ⓤ</f>he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him.
Exodus 21-31 If it gores a man's son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule.
Exodus 21-32 If the ox gores a slave, male or female, the owner shall give to their master <f>ⓥ</f>thirty shekels <f>[5]</f> of silver, and <f>ⓦ</f>the ox shall be stoned.
Exodus 21-33 <pb/>“When a man opens a pit, or when a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
Exodus 21-34 the owner of the pit shall make restoration. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead beast shall be his.
Exodus 21-35 <pb/>“When one man's ox butts another's, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and share its price, and the dead beast also they shall share.
Exodus 21-36 Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall repay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his.
Esther 10-1 <pb/>King Ahasuerus imposed tax on the land and on <f>ⓐ</f>the coastlands of the sea.
Esther 10-2 And all the acts of his power and might, and the full account of the high honor of Mordecai, <f>ⓑ</f>to which the king advanced him, are they not written in <f>ⓒ</f>the Book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
Esther 10-3 For Mordecai the Jew was <f>ⓓ</f>second in rank to King Ahasuerus, and he was great among the Jews and popular with the multitude of his brothers, for he <f>ⓔ</f>sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to all his people.
Lamentations 4-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> How the gold has grown dim, </t><t>how the pure gold is changed! </t><t>The holy stones lie scattered </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>at the head of every street. </t>
Lamentations 4-2 <pb/><t>The precious sons of Zion, </t><t>worth their weight in <f>ⓒ</f>fine gold, </t><t>how they are regarded as <f>ⓓ</f>earthen pots, </t><t>the work of a potter's hands! </t>
Lamentations 4-3 <pb/><t>Even jackals offer the breast; </t><t>they nurse their young; </t><t>but the daughter of my people has become cruel, </t><t>like the ostriches in the wilderness. </t>
Lamentations 4-4 <pb/><t>The tongue of the nursing infant <f>ⓔ</f>sticks </t><t>to the roof of its mouth for thirst; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the children beg for food, </t><t>but no one gives to them. </t>
Lamentations 4-5 <pb/><t>Those who once feasted on delicacies </t><t>perish in the streets; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>those who were brought up in purple </t><t>embrace ash heaps. </t>
Lamentations 4-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> For the chastisement <f>[1]</f> of the daughter of my people has been greater </t><t>than the punishment <f>[2]</f> of Sodom, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>which was overthrown in a moment, </t><t>and no hands were wrung for her. <f>[3]</f> </t>
Lamentations 4-7 <pb/><t>Her princes were purer than snow, </t><t>whiter than milk; </t><t>their bodies were more ruddy than coral, </t><t>the beauty of their form <f>[4]</f> was like sapphire. <f>[5]</f> </t>
Lamentations 4-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Now their face is blacker than soot; </t><t>they are not recognized in the streets; </t><t>their skin has shriveled on their bones; </t><t>it has become as dry as wood. </t>
Lamentations 4-9 <pb/><t>Happier were the victims of the sword </t><t>than the victims of hunger, </t><t>who wasted away, pierced </t><t>by lack of the fruits of the field. </t>
Lamentations 4-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> The hands of <f>ⓛ</f>compassionate women </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>have boiled their own children; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>they became their food </t><t>during the destruction of the daughter of my people. </t>
Lamentations 4-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> The LORD gave full vent to his wrath; </t><t>he poured out his hot anger, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>he kindled a fire in Zion </t><t>that consumed its foundations. </t>
Lamentations 4-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> The kings of the earth did not believe, </t><t>nor any of the inhabitants of the world, </t><t>that foe or enemy could enter </t><t>the gates of Jerusalem. </t>
Lamentations 4-13 <pb/><t>This was for <f>ⓡ</f>the sins of her prophets </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>the iniquities of her priests, </t><t>who shed in the midst of her </t><t>the blood of the righteous. </t>
Lamentations 4-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> They wandered, blind, through the streets; </t><t>they were so defiled with blood </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>that no one was able to touch </t><t>their garments. </t>
Lamentations 4-15 <pb/><t>“Away! <f>ⓥ</f>Unclean!” people cried at them. </t><t>“Away! Away! Do not touch!” </t><t>So they became fugitives and wanderers; </t><t>people said among the nations, </t><t>“They shall stay with us no longer.” </t>
Lamentations 4-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> The LORD himself <f>[6]</f> has scattered them; </t><t>he will regard them no more; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>no honor was shown to the priests, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>no favor to the elders. </t>
Lamentations 4-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f> Our eyes failed, ever watching </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>vainly for help; </t><t>in our watching we watched </t><t>for <f>ⓑ</f>a nation which could not save. </t>
Lamentations 4-18 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> They dogged our steps </t><t>so that we could not walk in our streets; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>our end drew near; our days were numbered, </t><t>for our end had come. </t>
Lamentations 4-19 <pb/><t>Our pursuers were <f>ⓔ</f>swifter </t><t>than the eagles in the heavens; </t><t>they chased us on the mountains; </t><t>they lay in wait for us in the wilderness. </t>
Lamentations 4-20 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> The breath of our nostrils, <f>ⓖ</f>the LORD's anointed, </t><t>was captured <f>ⓗ</f>in their pits, </t><t>of whom we said, <f>ⓘ</f>“Under his shadow </t><t>we shall live among the nations.” </t>
Lamentations 4-21 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, </t><t>you who dwell in <f>ⓚ</f>the land of Uz; </t><t>but to you also <f>ⓛ</f>the cup shall pass; </t><t>you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare. </t>
Lamentations 4-22 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished; </t><t>he will keep you in exile no longer; <f>[7]</f> </t><t>but <f>ⓝ</f>your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish; </t><t>he will uncover your sins. </t>
Jude 1-1 <pb/>Jude, a servant <f>[1]</f> of Jesus Christ and brother of James, <pb/><f>ⓐ</f>To those who are called, <f>ⓑ</f>beloved in God the Father and <f>ⓒ</f>kept for <f>[2]</f> Jesus Christ:
Jude 1-2 <pb/>May <f>ⓓ</f>mercy, <f>ⓔ</f>peace, and love be multiplied to you.
Jude 1-3 <pb/>Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our <f>ⓕ</f>common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you <f>ⓖ</f>to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.
Jude 1-4 For <f>ⓗ</f>certain people <f>ⓘ</f>have crept in unnoticed <f>ⓙ</f>who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert <f>ⓚ</f>the grace of our God into sensuality and <f>ⓛ</f>deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
Jude 1-5 <pb/>Now I want <f>ⓜ</f>to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that <f>ⓝ</f>Jesus, who saved <f>[3]</f> a people out of the land of Egypt, <f>ⓞ</f>afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
Jude 1-6 And <f>ⓟ</f>the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day —
Jude 1-7 just as <f>ⓠ</f>Sodom and Gomorrah and <f>ⓡ</f>the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and <f>ⓢ</f>pursued unnatural desire, <f>[4]</f> serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
Jude 1-8 <pb/>Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and <f>ⓣ</f>blaspheme the glorious ones.
Jude 1-9 But when <f>ⓤ</f>the archangel <f>ⓥ</f>Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing <f>ⓦ</f>about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, <f>ⓧ</f>“The Lord rebuke you.”
Jude 1-10 <f>ⓨ</f> But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively.
Jude 1-11 Woe to them! For they walked in <f>ⓩ</f>the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain <f>ⓐ</f>to Balaam's error and <f>ⓑ</f>perished in Korah's rebellion.
Jude 1-12 These are hidden reefs <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, <f>ⓓ</f>shepherds feeding themselves; <f>ⓔ</f>waterless clouds, <f>ⓕ</f>swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, <f>ⓖ</f>uprooted;
Jude 1-13 <f>ⓗ</f> wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of <f>ⓘ</f>their own shame; <f>ⓙ</f>wandering stars, <f>ⓚ</f>for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.
Jude 1-14 <pb/>It was also about these that Enoch, <f>ⓛ</f>the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>“Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones,
Jude 1-15 <f>ⓝ</f> to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have <f>ⓞ</f>committed in such an ungodly way, and of all <f>ⓟ</f>the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”
Jude 1-16 These are grumblers, malcontents, <f>ⓠ</f>following their own sinful desires; <f>ⓡ</f>they are loud-mouthed boasters, <f>ⓢ</f>showing favoritism to gain advantage.
Jude 1-17 <pb/>But you must <f>ⓣ</f>remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Jude 1-18 They <f>[6]</f> said to you, <f>ⓤ</f>“In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.”
Jude 1-19 It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, <f>ⓥ</f>devoid of the Spirit.
Jude 1-20 But you, beloved, <f>ⓦ</f>building yourselves up in your most holy faith and <f>ⓧ</f>praying in the Holy Spirit,
Jude 1-21 <f>ⓨ</f> keep yourselves in the love of God, <f>ⓩ</f>waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.
Jude 1-22 And have mercy on those who doubt;
Jude 1-23 save others by <f>ⓐ</f>snatching them out of <f>ⓑ</f>the fire; to others show mercy <f>ⓒ</f>with fear, hating even <f>ⓓ</f>the garment <f>[7]</f> stained by the flesh.
Jude 1-24 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Now to him who is able <f>ⓕ</f>to keep you from stumbling and <f>ⓖ</f>to present you <f>ⓗ</f>blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy,
Jude 1-25 to <f>ⓘ</f>the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, <f>ⓙ</f>be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time <f>[8]</f> and now and forever. Amen.
