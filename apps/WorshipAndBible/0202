5-1 <pb/>The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (<f>ⓐ</f>for he was the firstborn, but because <f>ⓑ</f>he defiled his father's couch, <f>ⓒ</f>his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, so that he could not be enrolled as the oldest son;
5-2 <f>ⓓ</f> though Judah became strong among his brothers and a <f>ⓔ</f>chief came from him, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph),
5-3 the <f>ⓕ</f>sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
5-4 The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,
5-5 Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son,
5-6 Beerah his son, whom <f>ⓖ</f>Tiglath-pileser <f>[1]</f> king of Assyria carried away into exile; he was a chief of the Reubenites.
5-7 And his kinsmen by their clans, <f>ⓗ</f>when the genealogy of their generations was recorded: the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,
5-8 and Bela the son of Azaz, son of <f>ⓘ</f>Shema, son of Joel, who lived in <f>ⓙ</f>Aroer, as far as <f>ⓚ</f>Nebo and <f>ⓛ</f>Baal-meon.
5-9 He also lived to the east as far as the entrance of the desert this side of the Euphrates, because their livestock had multiplied <f>ⓜ</f>in the land of Gilead.
5-10 And in the days of Saul they waged war against the <f>ⓝ</f>Hagrites, who fell into their hand. And they lived in their tents throughout all the region east of Gilead.
5-11 <pb/>The sons of Gad lived over against them in the land of Bashan as far as <f>ⓞ</f>Salecah:
5-12 Joel the chief, Shapham the second, Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.
5-13 And their kinsmen according to their fathers' houses: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia and Eber, seven.
5-14 These were the sons of Abihail the son of Huri, son of Jaroah, son of Gilead, son of Michael, son of Jeshishai, son of Jahdo, son of Buz.
5-15 Ahi the son of Abdiel, son of Guni, was chief in their fathers' houses,
5-16 and they lived in Gilead, in Bashan and in its towns, and in all the pasturelands of <f>ⓟ</f>Sharon to their limits.
5-17 All of these were recorded in genealogies in the days of <f>ⓠ</f>Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of <f>ⓡ</f>Jeroboam king of Israel.
5-18 <pb/>The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had valiant men who carried shield and sword, and drew the bow, <f>ⓢ</f>expert in war, 44,760, able to go to war.
5-19 They waged war against the <f>ⓣ</f>Hagrites, <f>ⓤ</f>Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
5-20 And when they prevailed <f>[2]</f> over them, the Hagrites and all who were with them were given into their hands, <f>ⓥ</f>for they cried out to God in the battle, and he granted their urgent plea <f>ⓦ</f>because they trusted in him.
5-21 They carried off their livestock: 50,000 of their camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys, and 100,000 men alive.
5-22 For many fell, because the war was of God. And they lived <f>ⓧ</f>in their place until <f>ⓨ</f>the exile.
5-23 <pb/>The members of the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land. They were very numerous from Bashan to Baal-hermon, <f>ⓩ</f>Senir, and Mount Hermon.
5-24 These were the heads of their fathers' houses: Epher, <f>[3]</f> Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty warriors, famous men, heads of their fathers' houses.
5-25 But they broke faith with the God of their fathers, and <f>ⓐ</f>whored <f>ⓑ</f>after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
5-26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of <f>ⓒ</f>Pul king of Assyria, the spirit of <f>ⓓ</f>Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and he took them into exile, namely, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them <f>ⓔ</f>to Halah, <f>ⓕ</f>Habor, Hara, and <f>ⓖ</f>the river Gozan, to this day.
29-1 <pb/><t>Ah, Ariel, Ariel, </t><t>the city <f>ⓐ</f>where David encamped! </t><t>Add year to year; </t><t>let the feasts run their round.</t>
29-2 <t>Yet I will distress Ariel, </t><t>and there shall be moaning and lamentation, </t><t>and she shall be to me like an Ariel. <f>[1]</f></t>
29-3 <t><f>ⓑ</f> And I will encamp against you all around, </t><t>and will besiege you <f>ⓒ</f>with towers </t><t>and I will raise siegeworks against you.</t>
29-4 <t><f>ⓓ</f> And you will be brought low; from the earth you shall speak, </t><t>and from the dust your speech will be bowed down; </t><t>your voice shall come from the ground like <f>ⓔ</f>the voice of a ghost, </t><t>and from the dust your speech shall whisper. </t>
29-5 <pb/><t>But the multitude of your foreign foes shall be like <f>ⓕ</f>small dust, </t><t>and the multitude of the ruthless like passing chaff. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>And in an instant, suddenly,</t>
29-6 <t><f>ⓗ</f> you will be visited by the LORD of hosts </t><t>with thunder and with earthquake and great noise, </t><t>with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.</t>
29-7 <t>And <f>ⓘ</f>the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, </t><t>all that fight against her and her stronghold and distress her, </t><t>shall be <f>ⓙ</f>like a dream, a vision of the night.</t>
29-8 <t><f>ⓚ</f> As when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he is eating, </t><t>and awakes with his hunger not satisfied, </t><t>or as when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he is drinking, </t><t>and awakes faint, with his thirst not quenched, </t><t>so shall the multitude of all the nations be </t><t>that fight against Mount Zion. </t>
29-9 <pb/><t>Astonish yourselves <f>[2]</f> and be astonished; </t><t>blind yourselves and be blind! </t><t>Be drunk, <f>[3]</f> but not with wine; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>stagger, <f>[4]</f> but not with strong drink!</t>
29-10 <t><f>ⓜ</f> For the LORD has poured out upon you </t><t>a spirit of deep sleep, </t><t>and has closed your eyes (the prophets), </t><t>and covered your heads (the seers). </t>
29-11 <pb/>And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is <f>ⓝ</f>sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.”
29-12 And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot read.”
29-13 <pb/><t>And the Lord said: </t><t>“Because <f>ⓞ</f>this people <f>ⓟ</f>draw near with their mouth </t><t>and honor me with their lips, </t><t>while their hearts are far from me, </t><t>and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,</t>
29-14 <t>therefore, behold, <f>ⓠ</f>I will again </t><t>do wonderful things with this people, </t><t>with wonder upon wonder; </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, </t><t>and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden.” </t>
29-15 <pb/><t>Ah, <f>ⓢ</f>you who hide deep from the LORD your counsel, </t><t>whose deeds are <f>ⓣ</f>in the dark, </t><t>and who say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”</t>
29-16 <t><f>ⓤ</f> You turn things upside down! </t><t>Shall the potter be regarded as the clay, </t><t>that the thing made should say of its maker, </t><t>“He did not make me”; </t><t>or the thing formed say of him who formed it, </t><t>“He has no understanding”? </t>
29-17 <pb/><t>Is it not yet a very little while </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, </t><t>and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?</t>
29-18 <t>In that day <f>ⓦ</f>the deaf shall hear </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>the words of a book, </t><t>and out of their gloom and darkness </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>the eyes of the blind shall see.</t>
29-19 <t><f>ⓩ</f> The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD, </t><t>and the poor among mankind shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.</t>
29-20 <t>For the ruthless shall come to nothing </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>the scoffer cease, </t><t>and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off,</t>
29-21 <t>who by a word make a man out to be an offender, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, </t><t>and with an empty plea <f>ⓒ</f>turn aside him who is in the right. </t>
29-22 <pb/>Therefore thus says the LORD, <f>ⓓ</f>who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: <pb/><t>“Jacob shall no more be ashamed, </t><t>no more shall his face grow pale.</t>
29-23 <t>For when he sees his children, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>the work of my hands, in his midst, </t><t>they will sanctify my name; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob </t><t>and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.</t>
29-24 <t>And those <f>ⓖ</f>who go astray in spirit will come to understanding, </t><t>and those who murmur will accept instruction.” </t>
11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
11-2 <pb/>Now I commend you <f>ⓑ</f>because you remember me in everything and <f>ⓒ</f>maintain the traditions <f>ⓓ</f>even as I delivered them to you.
11-3 But I want you to understand that <f>ⓔ</f>the head of every man is Christ, <f>ⓕ</f>the head of a wife <f>[1]</f> is her husband, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>the head of Christ is God.
11-4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head,
11-5 but every wife <f>[3]</f> who prays or <f>ⓗ</f>prophesies <f>ⓘ</f>with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same <f>ⓙ</f>as if her head were shaven.
11-6 For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head.
11-7 For a man ought not to cover his head, since <f>ⓚ</f>he is the image and glory of God, but <f>ⓛ</f>woman is the glory of man.
11-8 For <f>ⓜ</f>man was not made from woman, but woman from man.
11-9 Neither was man created for woman, but <f>ⓝ</f>woman for man.
11-10 That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. <f>[4]</f>
11-11 Nevertheless, <f>ⓞ</f>in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman;
11-12 for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And <f>ⓟ</f>all things are from God.
11-13 Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered?
11-14 Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him,
11-15 but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
11-16 <f>ⓠ</f> If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do <f>ⓡ</f>the churches of God.
11-17 <pb/>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
11-18 For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, <f>ⓢ</f>I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, <f>[5]</f>
11-19 for <f>ⓣ</f>there must be factions among you in order <f>ⓤ</f>that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.
11-20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.
11-21 For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, <f>ⓥ</f>another gets drunk.
11-22 What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise <f>ⓦ</f>the church of God and <f>ⓧ</f>humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.
11-23 <pb/>For <f>ⓨ</f>I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that <f>ⓩ</f>the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,
11-24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <J>“This is my body, which is for <f>[6]</f> you. Do this in remembrance of me.” <f>[7]</f></J>
11-25 In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <J>“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</J>
11-26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death <f>ⓐ</f>until he comes.
11-27 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord <f>ⓒ</f>in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning <f>ⓓ</f>the body and blood of the Lord.
11-28 <f>ⓔ</f> Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
11-29 For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.
11-30 That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some <f>ⓕ</f>have died. <f>[8]</f>
11-31 <f>ⓖ</f> But if we judged <f>[9]</f> ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
11-32 But when we are judged by the Lord, <f>ⓗ</f>we are disciplined <f>[10]</f> so that we may not be <f>ⓘ</f>condemned along with the world.
11-33 <pb/>So then, my brothers, <f>[11]</f> when you come together to eat, wait for <f>[12]</f> one another —
11-34 <f>ⓙ</f> if anyone is hungry, <f>ⓚ</f>let him eat at home — so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things <f>ⓛ</f>I will give directions <f>ⓜ</f>when I come.
