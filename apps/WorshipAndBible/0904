5-1 <pb/>As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites <f>ⓐ</f>who were by the sea, <f>ⓑ</f>heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts <f>ⓒ</f>melted and <f>ⓓ</f>there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.
5-2 <pb/>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make <f>ⓔ</f>flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time.”
5-3 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. <f>[1]</f>
5-4 And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: <f>ⓕ</f>all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt.
5-5 Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
5-6 For the people of Israel walked <f>ⓖ</f>forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD; the LORD <f>ⓗ</f>swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give to us, <f>ⓘ</f>a land flowing with milk and honey.
5-7 So it was <f>ⓙ</f>their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
5-8 <pb/>When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed.
5-9 And the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the <f>ⓚ</f>reproach of Egypt from you.” And so the name of that place is called <f>ⓛ</f>Gilgal <f>[2]</f> to this day.
5-10 <pb/>While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover <f>ⓜ</f>on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho.
5-11 And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
5-12 And <f>ⓝ</f>the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
5-13 <pb/>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, <f>ⓞ</f>a man was standing before him <f>ⓟ</f>with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our adversaries?”
5-14 And he said, “No; but I am the commander of the army of the LORD. Now I have come.” And Joshua <f>ⓠ</f>fell on his face to the earth and worshiped <f>[3]</f> and said to him, “What does my lord say to his servant?”
5-15 And the commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, <f>ⓡ</f>“Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.
79-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> O God, <f>ⓑ</f>the nations have come into your <f>ⓒ</f>inheritance; </t><t>they have defiled your <f>ⓓ</f>holy temple; </t><t>they have <f>ⓔ</f>laid Jerusalem in ruins.</t>
79-2 <t>They have given <f>ⓕ</f>the bodies of your servants </t><t>to the birds of the heavens for food, </t><t>the flesh of your <f>ⓖ</f>faithful to <f>ⓗ</f>the beasts of the earth.</t>
79-3 <t>They have poured out their blood like water </t><t>all around Jerusalem, </t><t>and there was <f>ⓘ</f>no one to bury them.</t>
79-4 <t>We have become <f>ⓙ</f>a taunt to our neighbors, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>mocked and derided by those around us. </t>
79-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> How long, O LORD? Will you be angry <f>ⓜ</f>forever? </t><t>Will your <f>ⓝ</f>jealousy <f>ⓞ</f>burn like fire?</t>
79-6 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Pour out your anger on the nations </t><t>that <f>ⓠ</f>do not know you, </t><t>and on the kingdoms </t><t>that <f>ⓡ</f>do not call upon your name!</t>
79-7 <t>For they have devoured Jacob </t><t>and laid waste his habitation. </t>
79-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓢ</f> Do not remember against us <f>ⓣ</f>our former iniquities; <f>[1]</f> </t><t>let your compassion come speedily to meet us, </t><t>for we are <f>ⓤ</f>brought very low.</t>
79-9 <t><f>ⓥ</f> Help us, O God of our salvation, </t><t>for the glory of your name; </t><t>deliver us, and <f>ⓦ</f>atone for our sins, </t><t>for your <f>ⓧ</f>name's sake!</t>
79-10 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Why should the nations say, </t><t>“Where is their God?” </t><t>Let <f>ⓩ</f>the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants </t><t>be known among the nations before our eyes! </t>
79-11 <pb/><t>Let <f>ⓐ</f>the groans of the prisoners come before you; </t><t>according to your great power, preserve those <f>ⓑ</f>doomed to die!</t>
79-12 <t>Return <f>ⓒ</f>sevenfold into the <f>ⓓ</f>lap of our neighbors </t><t>the <f>ⓔ</f>taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lord!</t>
79-13 <t>But we your people, the <f>ⓕ</f>sheep of your pasture, </t><t>will <f>ⓖ</f>give thanks to you forever; </t><t>from generation to generation we will recount your praise. </t>
11-1 <pb/><t>Open your doors, <f>ⓐ</f>O Lebanon, </t><t>that the fire may devour your cedars!</t>
11-2 <t>Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, </t><t>for the glorious trees are ruined! </t><t>Wail, <f>ⓑ</f>oaks of Bashan, </t><t>for the thick forest has been felled!</t>
11-3 <t>The sound of <f>ⓒ</f>the wail of <f>ⓓ</f>the shepherds, </t><t>for their glory is ruined! </t><t>The sound of the roar of <f>ⓔ</f>the lions, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>for the thicket of the Jordan is ruined! </t>
11-4 <pb/>Thus said the LORD my God: <f>ⓖ</f>“Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter.
11-5 <f>ⓗ</f> Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the LORD, <f>ⓘ</f>I have become rich,’ and their own shepherds have no pity on them.
11-6 For <f>ⓙ</f>I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the LORD. Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor, and each into the hand of his king, and they shall crush the land, and I will deliver none from their hand.”
11-7 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named <f>ⓛ</f>Favor, the other I named <f>ⓜ</f>Union. <f>ⓝ</f>And I tended the sheep.
11-8 In one month <f>ⓞ</f>I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me.
11-9 So I said, “I will not be your shepherd. <f>ⓟ</f>What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another.”
11-10 And I took <f>ⓠ</f>my staff Favor, and I broke it, annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples.
11-11 So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD.
11-12 Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” And they weighed out as my wages <f>ⓡ</f>thirty pieces of silver.
11-13 Then the LORD said to me, “Throw it to the potter” — <f>ⓢ</f>the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the <f>ⓣ</f>thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter.
11-14 Then I broke <f>ⓤ</f>my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
11-15 <pb/>Then the LORD said to me, “Take once more the equipment of <f>ⓥ</f>a foolish shepherd.
11-16 For behold, I am raising up in the land a shepherd <f>ⓦ</f>who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but <f>ⓧ</f>devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs.
11-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓨ</f> “Woe to my worthless shepherd, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>who deserts the flock! </t><t>May the sword strike his arm </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>his right eye! </t><t>Let his arm be wholly withered, </t><t>his right eye utterly blinded!” </t>
