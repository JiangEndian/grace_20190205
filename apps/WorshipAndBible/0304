Genesis 8-1 <pb/>But God <f>ⓐ</f>remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And <f>ⓑ</f>God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided.
Genesis 8-2 <f>ⓒ</f> The fountains of the deep and <f>ⓓ</f>the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
Genesis 8-3 and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end <f>ⓔ</f>of 150 days the waters had abated,
Genesis 8-4 and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of <f>ⓕ</f>Ararat.
Genesis 8-5 And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
Genesis 8-6 <pb/>At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
Genesis 8-7 and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
Genesis 8-8 Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground.
Genesis 8-9 But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.
Genesis 8-10 He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
Genesis 8-11 And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
Genesis 8-12 Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore.
Genesis 8-13 <pb/>In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
Genesis 8-14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out.
Genesis 8-15 Then God said to Noah,
Genesis 8-16 “Go out from the ark, <f>ⓖ</f>you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
Genesis 8-17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh — birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth — that they may swarm on the earth, and <f>ⓗ</f>be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”
Genesis 8-18 So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.
Genesis 8-19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark.
Genesis 8-20 <pb/>Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Genesis 8-21 And when the LORD smelled <f>ⓘ</f>the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, “I will never again <f>ⓙ</f>curse <f>[1]</f> the ground because of man, for <f>ⓚ</f>the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth. <f>ⓛ</f>Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.
Genesis 8-22 <f>ⓜ</f> While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, <f>ⓝ</f>day and night, shall not cease.”
2 Chronicles 6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then Solomon said, “The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
2 Chronicles 6-2 But I have built you <f>ⓑ</f>an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever.”
2 Chronicles 6-3 Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.
2 Chronicles 6-4 And he said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,
2 Chronicles 6-5 ‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, and I chose no man as prince over my people Israel;
2 Chronicles 6-6 <f>ⓒ</f> but I have chosen Jerusalem that my name may be there, <f>ⓓ</f>and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’
2 Chronicles 6-7 <f>ⓔ</f> Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 6-8 But the LORD said to David my father, ‘Whereas <f>ⓕ</f>it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.
2 Chronicles 6-9 Nevertheless, it is not you who shall build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’
2 Chronicles 6-10 Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 6-11 And there I have set the ark, <f>ⓖ</f>in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the people of Israel.”
2 Chronicles 6-12 <pb/>Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
2 Chronicles 6-13 <f>ⓗ</f> Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits <f>[1]</f> long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court, and he stood on it. <f>ⓘ</f>Then he knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven,
2 Chronicles 6-14 and said, “O LORD, God of Israel, <f>ⓙ</f>there is no God like you, in heaven or on earth, <f>ⓚ</f>keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart,
2 Chronicles 6-15 <f>ⓛ</f> who have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day.
2 Chronicles 6-16 Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>‘You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, <f>ⓝ</f>if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.’
2 Chronicles 6-17 Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David.
2 Chronicles 6-18 <pb/>“But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth? Behold, <f>ⓞ</f>heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that I have built!
2 Chronicles 6-19 Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you,
2 Chronicles 6-20 <f>ⓟ</f> that your eyes may be open day and night toward this house, the place where you have promised to set your name, that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place.
2 Chronicles 6-21 And listen to the pleas of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen from heaven your dwelling place, <f>ⓠ</f>and when you hear, forgive.
2 Chronicles 6-22 <pb/>“If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house,
2 Chronicles 6-23 then hear from heaven and act and judge your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
2 Chronicles 6-24 <pb/>“If your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and they turn again and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house,
2 Chronicles 6-25 <f>ⓡ</f> then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to them and to their fathers.
2 Chronicles 6-26 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict <f>[2]</f> them,
2 Chronicles 6-27 <f>ⓣ</f> then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way <f>[3]</f> in which they should walk, and grant rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.

2 Chronicles 6-29 whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing his own affliction and his own sorrow and stretching out his hands toward this house,
2 Chronicles 6-30 <f>ⓥ</f> then hear from heaven your dwelling place and forgive and render to each whose heart you know, according to all his ways, <f>ⓦ</f>for you, you only, know the hearts of the children of mankind,
2 Chronicles 6-31 that they may fear you and walk in your ways all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers.
2 Chronicles 6-32 <pb/>“Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for the sake of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, when he comes and prays toward this house,
2 Chronicles 6-33 hear from heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house <f>ⓧ</f>that I have built is called by your name.
2 Chronicles 6-34 <pb/>“If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
2 Chronicles 6-35 then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.
2 Chronicles 6-36 <pb/>“If they sin against you — <f>ⓨ</f>for there is no one who does not sin — and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to a land far or near,
2 Chronicles 6-37 yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,’
2 Chronicles 6-38 if they repent with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity to which they were carried captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,
2 Chronicles 6-39 then hear from heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their pleas, and maintain their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
2 Chronicles 6-40 Now, O my God, <f>ⓩ</f>let your eyes be open <f>ⓐ</f>and your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.
2 Chronicles 6-41 <pb/><t>“And now arise, O LORD God, and go to your <f>ⓑ</f>resting place, </t><t>you and the ark of your might. </t><t>Let your priests, O LORD God, be <f>ⓒ</f>clothed with salvation, </t><t>and let your saints <f>ⓓ</f>rejoice in your goodness.</t>

Isaiah 59-1 <pb/><t>Behold, <f>ⓐ</f>the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, </t><t>or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;</t>
Isaiah 59-2 <t><f>ⓑ</f> but your iniquities have made a separation </t><t>between you and your God, </t><t>and your sins have hidden his face from you </t><t>so that he does not hear.</t>
Isaiah 59-3 <t><f>ⓒ</f> For your hands are defiled with blood </t><t>and your fingers with iniquity; </t><t>your lips have spoken lies; </t><t>your tongue mutters wickedness.</t>
Isaiah 59-4 <t><f>ⓓ</f> No one enters suit justly; </t><t>no one goes to law honestly; </t><t>they rely on empty pleas, they speak lies, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.</t>
Isaiah 59-5 <t>They hatch adders' eggs; </t><t>they weave the spider's web; </t><t>he who eats their eggs dies, </t><t>and from one that is crushed a viper is hatched.</t>
Isaiah 59-6 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Their webs will not serve as clothing; </t><t>men will not cover themselves with what they make. </t><t>Their works are works of iniquity, </t><t>and deeds of violence are in their hands.</t>
Isaiah 59-7 <t><f>ⓖ</f> Their feet run to evil, </t><t>and they are swift to shed innocent blood; </t><t>their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; </t><t>desolation and destruction are in their highways.</t>
Isaiah 59-8 <t>The way of peace they do not know, </t><t>and there is no justice in their paths; </t><t>they have made their roads crooked; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>no one who treads on them knows peace. </t>
Isaiah 59-9 <pb/><t>Therefore justice is far from us, </t><t>and righteousness does not overtake us; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>we hope for light, and behold, darkness, </t><t>and for brightness, but we walk in gloom.</t>

Isaiah 59-12 <t>For our transgressions are multiplied before you, </t><t>and our sins testify against us; </t><t>for our transgressions are with us, </t><t>and we know our iniquities:</t>
Isaiah 59-13 <t>transgressing, and denying the LORD, </t><t>and turning back from following our God, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>speaking oppression and revolt, </t><t>conceiving and uttering from the heart lying words. </t>
Isaiah 59-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> Justice is turned back, </t><t>and righteousness stands far away; </t><t>for truth has stumbled in the public squares, </t><t>and uprightness cannot enter.</t>
Isaiah 59-15 <t>Truth is lacking, </t><t>and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. </t> <pb/><t>The LORD saw it, and it displeased him <f>[1]</f> </t><t>that there was no justice.</t>

Isaiah 59-17 <t><f>ⓠ</f> He put on righteousness as a breastplate, </t><t>and a helmet of salvation on his head; </t><t>he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, </t><t>and wrapped himself in <f>ⓡ</f>zeal as a cloak.</t>
Isaiah 59-18 <t><f>ⓢ</f> According to their deeds, so will he repay, </t><t>wrath to his adversaries, repayment to his enemies; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>to the coastlands he will render repayment.</t>

Philippians 1-1 <pb/>Paul and Timothy, servants <f>[1]</f> of Christ Jesus, <pb/>To all the <f>ⓐ</f>saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the <f>ⓑ</f>overseers <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓒ</f>deacons: <f>[3]</f>
Philippians 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> I thank my God <f>ⓕ</f>in all my remembrance of you,
Philippians 1-4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy,
Philippians 1-5 <f>ⓖ</f> because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
Philippians 1-6 And I am sure of this, that he who began <f>ⓗ</f>a good work in you <f>ⓘ</f>will bring it to completion at <f>ⓙ</f>the day of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1-7 It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you <f>ⓚ</f>in my heart, for you are all <f>ⓛ</f>partakers with me of grace, <f>[4]</f> both <f>ⓜ</f>in my imprisonment and in <f>ⓝ</f>the defense and confirmation of the gospel.
Philippians 1-8 For <f>ⓞ</f>God is my witness, <f>ⓟ</f>how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
Philippians 1-9 And it is my prayer that <f>ⓠ</f>your love may abound more and more, <f>ⓡ</f>with knowledge and all discernment,
Philippians 1-10 so that you may approve what is excellent, <f>ⓢ</f>and so be pure and blameless <f>ⓣ</f>for the day of Christ,
Philippians 1-11 filled <f>ⓤ</f>with the fruit of righteousness that comes <f>ⓥ</f>through Jesus Christ, <f>ⓦ</f>to the glory and praise of God.
Philippians 1-12 <pb/>I want you to know, brothers, <f>[5]</f> that what has happened to me has really <f>ⓧ</f>served to advance the gospel,
Philippians 1-13 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard <f>[6]</f> and <f>ⓨ</f>to all the rest that <f>ⓩ</f>my imprisonment is for Christ.
Philippians 1-14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold <f>ⓐ</f>to speak the word <f>[7]</f> without fear.
Philippians 1-15 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will.
Philippians 1-16 The latter do it out of love, <f>ⓒ</f>knowing that I am put here for <f>ⓓ</f>the defense of the gospel.
Philippians 1-17 The former proclaim Christ <f>ⓔ</f>out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.
Philippians 1-18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. <pb/><e>To Live Is Christ</e> </pb> <pb/>Yes, and I will rejoice,
Philippians 1-19 for I know that <f>ⓕ</f>through your prayers and <f>ⓖ</f>the help of <f>ⓗ</f>the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,
Philippians 1-20 as it is my eager expectation and hope <f>ⓘ</f>that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full <f>ⓙ</f>courage now as always Christ <f>ⓚ</f>will be honored in my body, <f>ⓛ</f>whether by life or by death.
Philippians 1-21 For to me <f>ⓜ</f>to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
Philippians 1-22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
Philippians 1-23 <f>ⓝ</f> I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is <f>ⓞ</f>to depart and <f>ⓟ</f>be with Christ, for that is far better.
Philippians 1-24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
Philippians 1-25 <f>ⓠ</f> Convinced of this, <f>ⓡ</f>I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your <f>ⓢ</f>progress and <f>ⓣ</f>joy in the faith,
Philippians 1-26 so that in me <f>ⓤ</f>you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.
Philippians 1-27 <pb/>Only <f>ⓥ</f>let your manner of life be <f>ⓦ</f>worthy <f>[8]</f> of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you <f>ⓧ</f>that you are standing firm in one spirit, with <f>ⓨ</f>one mind <f>ⓩ</f>striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,
Philippians 1-28 and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is <f>ⓐ</f>a clear sign to them of their destruction, but <f>ⓑ</f>of your salvation, and that from God.
Philippians 1-29 For <f>ⓒ</f>it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also <f>ⓓ</f>suffer for his sake,
Philippians 1-30 engaged in the same <f>ⓔ</f>conflict that <f>ⓕ</f>you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
