Genesis 18-1 <pb/>And the LORD appeared to him by the <f>ⓐ</f>oaks <f>[1]</f> of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day.
Genesis 18-2 He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. <f>ⓑ</f>When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth
Genesis 18-3 and said, “O Lord, <f>[2]</f> if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.
Genesis 18-4 Let a <f>ⓒ</f>little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree,
Genesis 18-5 while I bring a morsel of bread, that <f>ⓓ</f>you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on — <f>ⓔ</f>since you have come to your servant.” So they said, “Do as you have said.”
Genesis 18-6 And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quick! Three seahs <f>[3]</f> of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes.”
Genesis 18-7 And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly.
Genesis 18-8 Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
Genesis 18-9 <pb/>They said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “She is <f>ⓕ</f>in the tent.”
Genesis 18-10 The LORD said, “I will surely return to you <f>ⓖ</f>about this time next year, and <f>ⓗ</f>Sarah your wife shall have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him.
Genesis 18-11 Now <f>ⓘ</f>Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.
Genesis 18-12 <f>ⓙ</f> So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, <f>ⓚ</f>“After I am worn out, and <f>ⓛ</f>my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?”
Genesis 18-13 The LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’
Genesis 18-14 <f>ⓜ</f> Is anything too hard <f>[4]</f> for the LORD? <f>ⓝ</f>At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.”
Genesis 18-15 But Sarah denied it, <f>[5]</f> saying, “I did not laugh,” for she was afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh.”
Genesis 18-16 <pb/>Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
Genesis 18-17 The LORD said, <f>ⓞ</f>“Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
Genesis 18-18 seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be <f>ⓟ</f>blessed in him?
Genesis 18-19 For I have <f>ⓠ</f>chosen <f>[6]</f> him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice, so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him.”
Genesis 18-20 Then the LORD said, “Because <f>ⓡ</f>the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave,
Genesis 18-21 <f>ⓢ</f> I will go down to see whether they have done altogether <f>[7]</f> according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, <f>ⓣ</f>I will know.”
Genesis 18-22 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham <f>ⓥ</f>still stood before the LORD.
Genesis 18-23 Then Abraham drew near and said, <f>ⓦ</f>“Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
Genesis 18-24 Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?
Genesis 18-25 Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, <f>ⓧ</f>so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! <f>ⓨ</f>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”
Genesis 18-26 And the LORD said, <f>ⓩ</f>“If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”
Genesis 18-27 <pb/>Abraham answered and said, <f>ⓐ</f>“Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.
Genesis 18-28 Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And he said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”
Genesis 18-29 Again he spoke to him and said, “Suppose forty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.”
Genesis 18-30 Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.”
Genesis 18-31 He said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.”
Genesis 18-32 Then he said, <f>ⓑ</f>“Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.”
Genesis 18-33 And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.
2 Chronicles 16-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the <f>ⓑ</f>thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, <f>ⓒ</f>that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
2 Chronicles 16-2 Then Asa took silver and gold from the treasures of the house of the LORD and the king's house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
2 Chronicles 16-3 “There is a covenant <f>[1]</f> between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.”
2 Chronicles 16-4 And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the <f>ⓓ</f>store cities of Naphtali.
2 Chronicles 16-5 And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease.
2 Chronicles 16-6 Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.
2 Chronicles 16-7 <pb/>At that time <f>ⓔ</f>Hanani <f>ⓕ</f>the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Because you relied on the king of Syria, and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you.
2 Chronicles 16-8 Were not <f>ⓗ</f>the Ethiopians and <f>ⓘ</f>the Libyans a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet <f>ⓙ</f>because you relied on the LORD, he gave them into your hand.
2 Chronicles 16-9 <f>ⓚ</f> For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to give strong support to those <f>ⓛ</f>whose heart is blameless <f>[2]</f> toward him. <f>ⓜ</f>You have done foolishly in this, for from now on <f>ⓝ</f>you will have wars.”
2 Chronicles 16-10 Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him <f>ⓞ</f>in the stocks in prison, for he was in a rage with him because of this. And Asa inflicted cruelties upon some of the people at the same time.
2 Chronicles 16-11 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 16-12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but sought help from physicians.
2 Chronicles 16-13 And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.
2 Chronicles 16-14 They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier <f>ⓠ</f>that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer's art, <f>ⓡ</f>and they made a very great fire in his honor.
Jeremiah 3-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> “If <f>[1]</f> a man divorces his wife </t><t>and she goes from him </t><t>and becomes another man's wife, </t><t>will he return to her? </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>Would not that land be greatly polluted? </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>You have played the whore with many lovers; </t><t>and would you return to me? <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 3-2 <t>Lift up your eyes to <f>ⓓ</f>the bare heights, and see! </t><t>Where have you not been ravished? </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers </t><t>like an Arab in the wilderness. </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>You have polluted the land </t><t>with your vile whoredom.</t>
Jeremiah 3-3 <t><f>ⓖ</f> Therefore the showers have been withheld, </t><t>and the spring rain has not come; </t><t>yet you have <f>ⓗ</f>the forehead of a whore; </t><t>you refuse to be ashamed.</t>
Jeremiah 3-4 <t>Have you not just now <f>ⓘ</f>called to me, </t><t>‘My father, you are the friend of my youth — </t>
Jeremiah 3-5 <t><f>ⓙ</f> will he be angry forever, </t><t>will he be indignant to the end?’ </t><t>Behold, you have spoken, </t><t>but you have done all the evil that you could.” </t>
Jeremiah 3-6 <pb/>The LORD said to me in the days of <f>ⓚ</f>King Josiah: “Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, <f>ⓛ</f>how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there <f>ⓜ</f>played the whore?
Jeremiah 3-7 And I thought, ‘After she has done all this she will return to me,’ but she did not return, and her treacherous <f>ⓝ</f>sister Judah saw it.
Jeremiah 3-8 She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, <f>ⓞ</f>I had sent her away with <f>ⓟ</f>a decree of divorce. <f>ⓠ</f>Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went <f>ⓡ</f>and played the whore.
Jeremiah 3-9 Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with <f>ⓢ</f>stone and tree.
Jeremiah 3-10 Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me <f>ⓣ</f>with her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the LORD.”
Jeremiah 3-11 <pb/>And the LORD said to me, <f>ⓤ</f>“Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
Jeremiah 3-12 Go, and proclaim these words toward <f>ⓥ</f>the north, and say, <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f>“‘Return, faithless Israel, <pb/>declares the LORD. </t><t>I will not look on you in anger, </t><t>for <f>ⓧ</f>I am merciful, <pb/>declares the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>I will not be angry forever.</t>
Jeremiah 3-13 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Only acknowledge your guilt, </t><t>that you rebelled against the LORD your God </t><t>and scattered your favors among foreigners under <f>ⓐ</f>every green tree, </t><t>and that you have not obeyed my voice, <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 3-14 <t><f>ⓑ</f> Return, O faithless children, <pb/>declares the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>for I am your master; </t><t>I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, </t><t>and I will bring you to Zion. </t>
Jeremiah 3-15 <pb/>“‘And <f>ⓓ</f>I will give you shepherds after my own heart, <f>ⓔ</f>who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.
Jeremiah 3-16 And when you have multiplied and been fruitful in the land, in those days, declares the LORD, they shall no more say, “The ark of the covenant of the LORD.” It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again.
Jeremiah 3-17 At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD, <f>ⓕ</f>and all nations shall gather to it, <f>ⓖ</f>to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart.
Jeremiah 3-18 <f>ⓗ</f> In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land <f>ⓘ</f>of the north to <f>ⓙ</f>the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.
Jeremiah 3-19 <pb/><t>“‘I said, </t><t>How I would set you among my sons, </t><t>and give you a pleasant land, </t><t>a heritage most beautiful of all nations. </t><t>And I thought you would <f>ⓚ</f>call me, My Father, </t><t>and would not turn from following me.</t>
Jeremiah 3-20 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Surely, as a treacherous wife leaves her husband, </t><t>so have you been treacherous to me, O house of Israel, <pb/>declares the LORD.’” </t>
Jeremiah 3-21 <pb/><t>A voice on the <f>ⓜ</f>bare heights is heard, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>the weeping and pleading of Israel's sons </t><t>because they have perverted their way; </t><t>they have forgotten the LORD their God.</t>
Jeremiah 3-22 <t><f>ⓞ</f> “Return, O faithless sons; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>I will heal your faithlessness.” </t><t>“Behold, we come to you, </t><t>for you are the LORD our God.</t>

Jeremiah 3-24 <pb/>“But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
Jeremiah 3-25 <f>ⓢ</f> Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For <f>ⓣ</f>we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.”
1 Thessalonians 3-1 <pb/>Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing <f>ⓐ</f>to be left behind at Athens alone,
1 Thessalonians 3-2 and we <f>ⓑ</f>sent Timothy, <f>ⓒ</f>our brother and God's coworker <f>[1]</f> in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you in your faith,
1 Thessalonians 3-3 that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that <f>ⓓ</f>we are destined for this.
1 Thessalonians 3-4 For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, <f>ⓔ</f>just as it has come to pass, and just as you know.
1 Thessalonians 3-5 For this reason, <f>ⓕ</f>when I could bear it no longer, <f>ⓖ</f>I sent to learn about your faith, <f>ⓗ</f>for fear that somehow <f>ⓘ</f>the tempter had tempted you and <f>ⓙ</f>our labor would be in vain.
1 Thessalonians 3-6 <pb/>But <f>ⓚ</f>now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of <f>ⓛ</f>your faith and love and reported <f>ⓜ</f>that you always remember us kindly and <f>ⓝ</f>long to see us, as we long to see you —
1 Thessalonians 3-7 for this reason, brothers, <f>[2]</f> in all our distress and affliction <f>ⓞ</f>we have been comforted about you through your faith.
1 Thessalonians 3-8 For now we live, if you <f>ⓟ</f>are standing fast in the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 3-9 For <f>ⓠ</f>what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God,
1 Thessalonians 3-10 as we pray most earnestly <f>ⓡ</f>night and day <f>ⓢ</f>that we may see you face to face and <f>ⓣ</f>supply what is lacking in your faith?
