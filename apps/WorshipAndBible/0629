Numbers 8-1 <pb/>Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 8-2 “Speak to Aaron and say to him, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.”
Numbers 8-3 And Aaron did so: he set up its lamps in front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses.
Numbers 8-4 And <f>ⓐ</f>this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.
Numbers 8-5 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 8-6 “Take the Levites from among the people of Israel and cleanse them.
Numbers 8-7 Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the <f>ⓑ</f>water of purification upon them, and <f>ⓒ</f>let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves.
Numbers 8-8 Then let them take a bull from the herd and <f>ⓓ</f>its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, <f>ⓔ</f>and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering.
Numbers 8-9 <f>ⓕ</f> And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting <f>ⓖ</f>and assemble the whole congregation of the people of Israel.
Numbers 8-10 When you bring the Levites before the LORD, the people of Israel <f>ⓗ</f>shall lay their hands on the Levites,
Numbers 8-11 and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the people of Israel, that they may do the service of the LORD.
Numbers 8-12 Then the Levites <f>ⓘ</f>shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer <f>ⓙ</f>the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the LORD to make atonement for the Levites.
Numbers 8-13 And you shall set the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and shall offer them as <f>ⓚ</f>a wave offering to the LORD.
Numbers 8-14 <pb/>“Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel, and <f>ⓛ</f>the Levites shall be mine.
Numbers 8-15 And after that the Levites shall go in to serve at the tent of meeting, when you have cleansed them and offered them as a <f>ⓜ</f>wave offering.
Numbers 8-16 For they are <f>ⓝ</f>wholly given to me from among the people of Israel. <f>ⓞ</f>Instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself.
Numbers 8-17 <f>ⓟ</f> For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself,
Numbers 8-18 and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel.
Numbers 8-19 <f>ⓠ</f> And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel, to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and <f>ⓡ</f>to make atonement for the people of Israel, <f>ⓢ</f>that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary.”
Numbers 8-20 <pb/>Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites. According to all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, the people of Israel did to them.
Numbers 8-21 And <f>ⓣ</f>the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and <f>ⓤ</f>Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
Numbers 8-22 And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
Numbers 8-23 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 8-24 “This applies to the Levites: <f>ⓥ</f>from twenty-five years old and upward they <f>[1]</f> shall come to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers 8-25 And from the age of fifty years they shall withdraw from the duty of the service and serve no more.
Numbers 8-26 They minister <f>[2]</f> to their brothers in the tent of meeting <f>ⓦ</f>by keeping guard, but they shall do no service. Thus shall you do to the Levites in assigning their duties.”
Psalm 12-1 <f>[1]</f> <pb/><t> Save, O LORD, for <f>ⓐ</f>the godly one is gone; </t><t>for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.</t>
Psalm 12-2 <t>Everyone <f>ⓑ</f>utters lies to his neighbor; </t><t>with <f>ⓒ</f>flattering lips and <f>ⓓ</f>a double heart they speak. </t>
Psalm 12-3 <pb/><t>May the LORD cut off all <f>ⓔ</f>flattering lips, </t><t>the tongue that makes <f>ⓕ</f>great boasts,</t>
Psalm 12-4 <t>those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail, </t><t>our lips are with us; who is master over us?” </t>
Psalm 12-5 <pb/><t>“Because <f>ⓖ</f>the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>I will now arise,” says the LORD; </t><t>“I will place him in the <f>ⓘ</f>safety for which he longs.”</t>
Psalm 12-6 <t><f>ⓙ</f> The words of the LORD are pure words, </t><t>like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, </t><t>purified seven times. </t>
Psalm 12-7 <pb/><t>You, O LORD, will keep them; </t><t>you will guard us <f>[2]</f> from this generation forever.</t>
Psalm 12-8 <t>On every side the wicked prowl, </t><t>as vileness is exalted among the children of man. </t>
Daniel 5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> King Belshazzar <f>ⓑ</f>made a great feast for a thousand of his <f>ⓒ</f>lords and drank wine in front of the thousand.
Daniel 5-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Belshazzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that <f>ⓔ</f>the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father <f>[1]</f> had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.
Daniel 5-3 Then they brought in <f>ⓕ</f>the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.
Daniel 5-4 They drank wine and <f>ⓖ</f>praised the <f>ⓗ</f>gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
Daniel 5-5 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> Immediately <f>ⓙ</f>the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, opposite the lampstand. And the king saw <f>ⓚ</f>the hand as it wrote.
Daniel 5-6 <f>ⓛ</f> Then the king's color changed, <f>ⓜ</f>and his thoughts alarmed him; <f>ⓝ</f>his limbs gave way, and <f>ⓞ</f>his knees knocked together.
Daniel 5-7 <f>ⓟ</f> The king called loudly to bring in <f>ⓠ</f>the enchanters, the <f>ⓡ</f>Chaldeans, and <f>ⓢ</f>the astrologers. The king declared <f>[2]</f> to the wise men of Babylon, <f>ⓣ</f>“Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around his neck and <f>ⓤ</f>shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
Daniel 5-8 Then all the king's wise men came in, but <f>ⓥ</f>they could not read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation.
Daniel 5-9 Then King Belshazzar was greatly <f>ⓦ</f>alarmed, and his <f>ⓧ</f>color changed, and his <f>ⓨ</f>lords were perplexed.
Daniel 5-10 <pb/>The queen, <f>[3]</f> because of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banqueting hall, and the queen declared, <f>ⓩ</f>“O king, live forever! Let not your thoughts alarm you <f>ⓐ</f>or your color change.
Daniel 5-11 There is a man in your kingdom <f>ⓑ</f>in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. <f>[4]</f> In the days of your father, <f>ⓒ</f>light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father — your father the king — <f>ⓓ</f>made him chief of the magicians, <f>ⓔ</f>enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers,
Daniel 5-12 <f>ⓕ</f> because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and <f>ⓖ</f>understanding <f>ⓗ</f>to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and <f>ⓘ</f>solve problems were found in this Daniel, <f>ⓙ</f>whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.”
Daniel 5-13 <pb/>Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, “You are that Daniel, one of <f>ⓚ</f>the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah.
Daniel 5-14 I have heard of you that <f>ⓛ</f>the spirit of the gods <f>[5]</f> is in you, and that <f>ⓜ</f>light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.
Daniel 5-15 Now <f>ⓝ</f>the wise men, the <f>ⓞ</f>enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but <f>ⓟ</f>they could not show the interpretation of the matter.
Daniel 5-16 <f>ⓠ</f> But I have heard that you can give interpretations and <f>ⓡ</f>solve problems. <f>ⓢ</f>Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, <f>ⓣ</f>you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and <f>ⓤ</f>shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
Daniel 5-17 <pb/>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, <f>ⓥ</f>“Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation.
Daniel 5-18 O king, the <f>ⓦ</f>Most High God <f>ⓧ</f>gave <f>ⓨ</f>Nebuchadnezzar your father <f>ⓩ</f>kingship and greatness and glory and majesty.
Daniel 5-19 And because of the greatness that he gave him, <f>ⓐ</f>all peoples, nations, and languages <f>ⓑ</f>trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he would, he kept alive; whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would, he humbled.
Daniel 5-20 But <f>ⓒ</f>when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, <f>ⓓ</f>he was brought down from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him.
Daniel 5-21 <f>ⓔ</f> He was driven from among the children of mankind, and his mind was made like that of a beast, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, <f>ⓕ</f>until he knew that the <f>ⓖ</f>Most High God rules the kingdom of mankind and sets over it whom he will.
Daniel 5-22 And you his son, <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓗ</f>Belshazzar, <f>ⓘ</f>have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,
Daniel 5-23 but you have lifted up yourself against <f>ⓙ</f>the Lord of heaven. And <f>ⓚ</f>the vessels of his house have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. <f>ⓛ</f>And you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know, <f>ⓜ</f>but the God in whose hand is your breath, and <f>ⓝ</f>whose are all your ways, <f>ⓞ</f>you have not honored.
Daniel 5-24 <pb/>“Then from his presence <f>ⓟ</f>the hand was sent, and this writing was inscribed.
Daniel 5-25 And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN.
Daniel 5-26 This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE, God has numbered <f>[7]</f> the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end;
Daniel 5-27 TEKEL, <f>ⓠ</f>you have been weighed <f>[8]</f> in the balances and found wanting;
Daniel 5-28 PERES, your kingdom is divided and given to <f>ⓡ</f>the Medes and <f>ⓢ</f>Persians.” <f>[9]</f>
Daniel 5-29 <pb/>Then <f>ⓣ</f>Belshazzar gave the command, and Daniel <f>ⓤ</f>was clothed with purple, a chain of gold was put around his neck, and a proclamation was made about him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel 5-30 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> That very night <f>ⓦ</f>Belshazzar the <f>ⓧ</f>Chaldean king was killed.
Daniel 5-31 <f>[10]</f> And <f>ⓨ</f>Darius <f>ⓩ</f>the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.
