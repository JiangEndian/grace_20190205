8-1 <pb/>Now Elisha had said to the woman <f>ⓐ</f>whose son he had restored to life, “Arise, and depart with your household, and sojourn wherever you can, for the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>has called for a famine, and it will come upon the land for <f>ⓒ</f>seven years.”
8-2 So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
8-3 And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to appeal to the king for her house and her land.
8-4 Now the king was talking with <f>ⓓ</f>Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.”
8-5 And while he was telling the king how <f>ⓔ</f>Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life.”
8-6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, “Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.”
8-7 <pb/>Now Elisha came to <f>ⓕ</f>Damascus. <f>ⓖ</f>Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick. And when it was told him, “The man of God has come here,”
8-8 the king said to <f>ⓗ</f>Hazael, <f>ⓘ</f>“Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, <f>ⓙ</f>and inquire of the LORD through him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this sickness?’”
8-9 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camels' loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, <f>ⓚ</f>“Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this sickness?’”
8-10 And Elisha said to him, <f>ⓛ</f>“Go, say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover,’ but <f>[1]</f> the LORD has shown me that <f>ⓜ</f>he shall certainly die.”
8-11 And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, <f>ⓝ</f>until he was embarrassed. And the man of God wept.
8-12 And Hazael said, “Why does my lord weep?” He answered, “Because I know <f>ⓞ</f>the evil that you will do to the people of Israel. You will set on fire their fortresses, and you will kill their young men with the sword <f>ⓟ</f>and dash in pieces their little ones and rip open their pregnant women.”
8-13 And Hazael said, “What is your servant, <f>ⓠ</f>who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?” Elisha answered, <f>ⓡ</f>“The LORD has shown me that you are to be king over Syria.”
8-14 Then he departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me <f>ⓢ</f>that you would certainly recover.”
8-15 But the next day he took the bed cloth <f>[2]</f> and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died. And Hazael became king in his place.
8-16 <pb/>In the fifth year of <f>ⓣ</f>Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, <f>[3]</f> Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, began to reign.
8-17 He was <f>ⓤ</f>thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
8-18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for <f>ⓥ</f>the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
8-19 Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, <f>ⓦ</f>since he promised to give <f>ⓧ</f>a lamp to him and to his sons forever.
8-20 <pb/>In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah and set up <f>ⓨ</f>a king of their own.
8-21 Then Joram <f>[4]</f> passed over to Zair with all his chariots and rose by night, and he and his chariot commanders struck the Edomites who had surrounded him, but his army <f>ⓩ</f>fled home.
8-22 <f>ⓐ</f> So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then <f>ⓑ</f>Libnah revolted at the same time.
8-23 Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
8-24 So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried <f>ⓒ</f>with his fathers in the city of David, and <f>ⓓ</f>Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
8-25 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> In the <f>ⓕ</f>twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.
8-26 Ahaziah was <f>ⓖ</f>twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah; she was <f>ⓗ</f>a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
8-27 He also walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was son-in-law to the house of Ahab.
8-28 <pb/>He went with Joram the son of Ahab to make war against <f>ⓘ</f>Hazael king of Syria at <f>ⓙ</f>Ramoth-gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.
8-29 <f>ⓚ</f> And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him at <f>ⓛ</f>Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And <f>ⓜ</f>Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
7-1 <pb/>In the days of <f>ⓐ</f>Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, <f>ⓑ</f>Rezin the king of Syria and <f>ⓒ</f>Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it.
7-2 When the house of David was told, <f>ⓓ</f>“Syria is in league with <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>Ephraim,” the heart of Ahaz <f>[2]</f> and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
7-3 <pb/>And the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and <f>ⓕ</f>Shear-jashub <f>[3]</f> your son, at the end of <f>ⓖ</f>the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field.
7-4 And say to him, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Be careful, <f>ⓘ</f>be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two <f>ⓙ</f>smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and <f>ⓚ</f>the son of Remaliah.
7-5 Because Syria, with Ephraim and <f>ⓛ</f>the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying,
7-6 “Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it <f>[4]</f> for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,”
7-7 thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“‘It shall not stand, </t><t>and it shall not come to pass.</t>
7-8 <t>For the head of Syria is <f>ⓝ</f>Damascus, </t><t>and the head of Damascus is Rezin. </t><t>And within sixty-five years </t><t>Ephraim will be shattered from being a people.</t>
7-9 <t>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, </t><t>and the head of Samaria is <f>ⓞ</f>the son of Remaliah. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>If you <f>[5]</f> are not firm in faith, </t><t>you will not be firm at all.’” </t>
7-10 <pb/>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz:
7-11 “Ask <f>ⓠ</f>a sign of the LORD your <f>[6]</f> God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.”
7-12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.”
7-13 And he <f>[7]</f> said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you <f>ⓡ</f>weary my God also?
7-14 Therefore the <f>ⓢ</f>Lord himself will give you a sign. <f>ⓣ</f>Behold, the <f>ⓤ</f>virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name <f>ⓥ</f>Immanuel. <f>[8]</f>
7-15 He shall eat <f>ⓦ</f>curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.
7-16 <f>ⓧ</f> For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be <f>ⓨ</f>deserted.
7-17 <f>ⓩ</f> The LORD will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that <f>ⓐ</f>Ephraim departed from Judah — the king of Assyria!”
7-18 <pb/>In that day the LORD will <f>ⓑ</f>whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
7-19 And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and <f>ⓒ</f>in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures. <f>[9]</f>
7-20 <pb/>In that day <f>ⓓ</f>the Lord will <f>ⓔ</f>shave with a razor that is <f>ⓕ</f>hired beyond <f>ⓖ</f>the River <f>[10]</f> — with the king of Assyria — the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.
7-21 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep,
7-22 and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat <f>ⓘ</f>curds and honey.
7-23 <pb/>In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels <f>[11]</f> of silver, will become <f>ⓙ</f>briers and thorns.
7-24 <f>ⓚ</f> With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns.
7-25 <f>ⓛ</f> And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear <f>ⓜ</f>of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.
5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, <f>ⓑ</f>we <f>[1]</f> have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
5-2 Through him we have also <f>ⓒ</f>obtained access by faith <f>[2]</f> into this grace <f>ⓓ</f>in which we stand, and <f>ⓔ</f>we <f>[3]</f> rejoice <f>[4]</f> in hope of the glory of God.
5-3 Not only that, but we <f>ⓕ</f>rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering <f>ⓖ</f>produces endurance,
5-4 and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,
5-5 and <f>ⓗ</f>hope does not put us to shame, because God's love <f>ⓘ</f>has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
5-6 <pb/>For <f>ⓙ</f>while we were still weak, at the right time <f>ⓚ</f>Christ died for the ungodly.
5-7 For one will scarcely die for a righteous person — though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die —
5-8 but <f>ⓛ</f>God shows his love for us in that <f>ⓜ</f>while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
5-9 Since, therefore, <f>ⓝ</f>we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from <f>ⓞ</f>the wrath of God.
5-10 For if <f>ⓟ</f>while we were enemies <f>ⓠ</f>we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by <f>ⓡ</f>his life.
5-11 More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received <f>ⓢ</f>reconciliation.
5-12 <pb/>Therefore, just as <f>ⓣ</f>sin came into the world through one man, and <f>ⓤ</f>death through sin, and <f>ⓥ</f>so death spread to all men <f>[5]</f> because <f>ⓦ</f>all sinned —
5-13 for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but <f>ⓧ</f>sin is not counted where there is no law.
5-14 Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not <f>ⓨ</f>like the transgression of Adam, <f>ⓩ</f>who was a type of <f>ⓐ</f>the one who was to come.
5-15 <pb/>But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for <f>ⓑ</f>many.
5-16 And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For <f>ⓒ</f>the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought <f>ⓓ</f>justification.
5-17 For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness <f>ⓔ</f>reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.
5-18 <pb/>Therefore, as one trespass <f>[6]</f> led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness <f>[7]</f> leads to justification and life for <f>ⓕ</f>all men.
5-19 For as by the one man's <f>ⓖ</f>disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's <f>ⓗ</f>obedience the many will be made righteous.
5-20 Now <f>ⓘ</f>the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, <f>ⓙ</f>grace abounded all the more,
5-21 so that, <f>ⓚ</f>as sin reigned in death, <f>ⓛ</f>grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
