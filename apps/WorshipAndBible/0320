24-1 <pb/>Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. And the LORD <f>ⓐ</f>had blessed Abraham in all things.
24-2 And Abraham said to his servant, <f>ⓑ</f>the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, <f>ⓒ</f>“Put your hand under my thigh,
24-3 that I may make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that <f>ⓓ</f>you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell,
24-4 <f>ⓔ</f> but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”
24-5 The servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”
24-6 Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there.
24-7 The LORD, the God of heaven, <f>ⓕ</f>who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, <f>ⓖ</f>‘To your offspring I will give this land,’ <f>ⓗ</f>he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
24-8 But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then <f>ⓘ</f>you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.”
24-9 So the servant <f>ⓙ</f>put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.
24-10 <pb/>Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to <f>ⓚ</f>Mesopotamia <f>[1]</f> to the city of Nahor.
24-11 And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when <f>ⓛ</f>women go out to draw water.
24-12 And he said, “O LORD, <f>ⓜ</f>God of my master Abraham, <f>ⓝ</f>please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
24-13 Behold, <f>ⓞ</f>I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
24-14 Let the young woman to whom I shall say, ‘Please let down your jar that I may drink,’ and who shall say, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels’ — let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. <f>ⓟ</f>By this <f>[2]</f> I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.”
24-15 <pb/>Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of <f>ⓠ</f>Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder.
24-16 The young woman <f>ⓡ</f>was very attractive in appearance, a maiden <f>[3]</f> whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
24-17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.”
24-18 She said, “Drink, my lord.” And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.
24-19 When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.”
24-20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels.
24-21 The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.
24-22 <pb/>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, <f>[4]</f> and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,
24-23 and said, “Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?”
24-24 She said to him, <f>ⓢ</f>“I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”
24-25 She added, “We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night.”
24-26 <f>ⓣ</f> The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD
24-27 and said, “Blessed be the LORD, <f>ⓤ</f>the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken <f>ⓥ</f>his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD <f>ⓦ</f>has led me in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen.”
24-28 Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.
24-29 <pb/>Rebekah had a brother whose name was <f>ⓧ</f>Laban. Laban ran out toward the man, to the spring.
24-30 As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, “Thus the man spoke to me,” he went to the man. And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
24-31 He said, “Come in, <f>ⓨ</f>O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
24-32 So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave <f>ⓩ</f>straw and fodder to the camels, and there was <f>ⓐ</f>water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
24-33 Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, “I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.” He said, “Speak on.”
24-34 <pb/>So he said, “I am Abraham's servant.
24-35 The LORD <f>ⓑ</f>has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys.
24-36 And Sarah my master's wife <f>ⓒ</f>bore a son to my master when she was old, and <f>ⓓ</f>to him he has given all that he has.
24-37 <f>ⓔ</f> My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell,
24-38 but you shall go to my father's house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.’
24-39 I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’
24-40 But he said to me, ‘The LORD, <f>ⓕ</f>before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and <f>ⓖ</f>prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father's house.
24-41 Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’
24-42 <pb/>“I came today to the spring and said, <f>ⓗ</f>‘O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you <f>ⓘ</f>are prospering the way that I go,
24-43 behold, I am standing <f>ⓙ</f>by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, “Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,”
24-44 <f>ⓚ</f> and who will say to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,” let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master's son.’
24-45 <pb/>“Before I had finished <f>ⓛ</f>speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’
24-46 She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.’ So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also.
24-47 Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ <f>ⓜ</f>So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
24-48 <f>ⓝ</f> Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD and blessed the LORD, <f>ⓞ</f>the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way <f>[5]</f> to take <f>ⓟ</f>the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
24-49 Now then, if you are going to <f>ⓠ</f>show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.”
24-50 <pb/>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, “The thing has come from the LORD; we cannot <f>ⓡ</f>speak to you bad or good.
24-51 Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, <f>ⓢ</f>as the LORD has spoken.”
24-52 <pb/>When Abraham's servant heard their words, <f>ⓣ</f>he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD.
24-53 And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments.
24-54 And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, <f>ⓤ</f>“Send me away to my master.”
24-55 Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.”
24-56 But he said to them, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.”
24-57 They said, “Let us call the young woman and ask her.”
24-58 And they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.”
24-59 So they sent away Rebekah their sister and <f>ⓥ</f>her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men.
24-60 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, <pb/><t>“Our sister, may you <f>ⓦ</f>become </t><t>thousands of ten thousands, </t><t>and <f>ⓧ</f>may your offspring possess </t><t>the gate of those who hate him!” <f>[6]</f> </t>
24-61 <pb/>Then Rebekah and her young women arose and rode on the camels and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah and went his way.
24-62 <pb/>Now Isaac had returned from <f>ⓨ</f>Beer-lahai-roi and was dwelling in the Negeb.
24-63 And Isaac went out <f>ⓩ</f>to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, there were camels coming.
24-64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel
24-65 and said to the servant, “Who is that man, walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself.
24-66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
24-67 Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was <f>ⓐ</f>comforted after his mother's <f>ⓑ</f>death.
22-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, for the band of men that came with <f>ⓑ</f>the Arabians to the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
22-2 Ahaziah was twenty-two <f>[1]</f> years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, <f>ⓒ</f>the granddaughter of Omri.
22-3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in doing wickedly.
22-4 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done. For after the death of his father they were his counselors, to his undoing.
22-5 He even followed their counsel and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram,
22-6 and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was wounded.
22-7 <pb/>But it was ordained by <f>[2]</f> God that the downfall of Ahaziah should come about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there, <f>ⓓ</f>he went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, <f>ⓔ</f>whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
22-8 <f>ⓕ</f> And when Jehu was <f>ⓖ</f>executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he killed them.
22-9 <f>ⓗ</f> He searched for Ahaziah, and he was captured while hiding in Samaria, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. <f>ⓘ</f>They buried him, for they said, “He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, <f>ⓙ</f>who sought the LORD with all his heart.” And the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom.
22-10 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah.
22-11 But Jehoshabeath, <f>[3]</f> the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king's sons who were about to be put to death, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest, because she was a sister of Ahaziah, hid him <f>[4]</f> from Athaliah, so that she did not put him to death.
22-12 And he remained with them six years, hidden in the house of God, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
9-1 <pb/><t><pb/><f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>Oh that my head were waters, </t><t>and my eyes a fountain of tears, </t><t>that I might weep day and night </t><t>for the slain of <f>ⓑ</f>the daughter of my people!</t>
9-2 <t><f>[2]</f> Oh that I had in the desert </t><t>a travelers' lodging place, </t><t>that I might leave my people </t><t>and go away from them! </t><t>For they are all <f>ⓒ</f>adulterers, </t><t>a company of <f>ⓓ</f>treacherous men.</t>
9-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> They bend their tongue like a bow; </t><t>falsehood and not truth has grown strong <f>[3]</f> in the land; </t><t>for they proceed from evil to evil, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>and they do not know me, declares the LORD. </t>
9-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> Let everyone beware of his neighbor, </t><t>and put no trust in any brother, </t><t>for every <f>ⓗ</f>brother is a deceiver, </t><t>and every neighbor <f>ⓘ</f>goes about as a slanderer.</t>
9-5 <t>Everyone deceives his neighbor, </t><t>and no one speaks the truth; </t><t>they have taught their tongue to speak lies; </t><t>they weary themselves committing iniquity.</t>
9-6 <t>Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>they refuse to know me, declares the LORD. </t>
9-7 <pb/><t>Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: </t><t>“Behold, <f>ⓚ</f>I will refine them and <f>ⓛ</f>test them, </t><t>for what else can I do, <f>ⓜ</f>because of my people?</t>
9-8 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Their tongue is a deadly arrow; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>it speaks deceitfully; </t><t>with his mouth <f>ⓟ</f>each speaks peace to his neighbor, </t><t>but in his heart <f>ⓠ</f>he plans an ambush for him.</t>
9-9 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the LORD, </t><t>and shall I not avenge myself </t><t>on a nation such as this? </t>
9-10 <pb/><t>“I will take up weeping and wailing for the mountains, </t><t>and a lamentation for <f>ⓢ</f>the pastures of the wilderness, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>because they are laid waste so that no one passes through, </t><t>and the lowing of cattle is not heard; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>both the birds of the air and the beasts </t><t>have fled and are gone.</t>
9-11 <t><f>ⓥ</f> I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>a lair of jackals, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, </t><t>without inhabitant.” </t>
9-12 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Who is the man so wise that he can understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined <f>ⓩ</f>and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?
9-13 And the LORD says: <f>ⓐ</f>“Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it,
9-14 but <f>ⓑ</f>have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.
9-15 Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓒ</f>Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them <f>ⓓ</f>poisonous water to drink.
9-16 <f>ⓔ</f> I will scatter them among the nations <f>ⓕ</f>whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will <f>ⓖ</f>send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”
9-17 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD of hosts: </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>“Consider, and call for the mourning women to come; </t><t>send for the skillful women to come;</t>
9-18 <t>let them make haste <f>ⓘ</f>and raise a wailing over us, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>that our eyes may run down with tears </t><t>and our eyelids flow with water.</t>
9-19 <t>For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion: </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>‘How we are ruined! </t><t>We are utterly shamed, </t><t>because we have left the land, </t><t>because they have cast down our dwellings.’” </t>
9-20 <pb/><t>Hear, O women, the word of the LORD, </t><t>and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; </t><t>teach to your daughters a lament, </t><t>and each to her neighbor a dirge.</t>
9-21 <t>For death has come up into our windows; </t><t>it has entered our palaces, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>cutting off the children from the streets </t><t>and the young men from the squares.</t>
9-22 <t>Speak: “Thus declares the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>‘The dead bodies of men shall fall </t><t>like dung upon the open field, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>like sheaves after the reaper, </t><t>and none shall gather them.’” </t>
9-23 <pb/>Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓞ</f>“Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches,
9-24 but <f>ⓟ</f>let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. <f>ⓠ</f>For in these things I delight, declares the LORD.”
9-25 <pb/>“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when <f>ⓡ</f>I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh —
9-26 <f>ⓢ</f> Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and <f>ⓣ</f>all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are <f>ⓤ</f>uncircumcised in heart.”
1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>an apostle of Christ Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>by command of <f>ⓒ</f>God our Savior and of Christ Jesus <f>ⓓ</f>our hope,
1-2 <pb/>To Timothy, <f>ⓔ</f>my true child in the faith: <pb/><f>ⓕ</f>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1-3 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not <f>ⓗ</f>to teach any different doctrine,
1-4 nor <f>ⓘ</f>to devote themselves to myths and endless <f>ⓙ</f>genealogies, which promote <f>ⓚ</f>speculations rather than the stewardship <f>[1]</f> from God that is by faith.
1-5 The aim of our charge is love <f>ⓛ</f>that issues from a pure heart and <f>ⓜ</f>a good conscience and <f>ⓝ</f>a sincere faith.
1-6 Certain persons, by <f>ⓞ</f>swerving from these, have wandered away into <f>ⓟ</f>vain discussion,
1-7 desiring to be teachers of the law, <f>ⓠ</f>without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions.
1-8 <pb/>Now we know that <f>ⓡ</f>the law is good, if one uses it lawfully,
1-9 understanding this, that the <f>ⓢ</f>law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers,
1-10 the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, <f>[2]</f> liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to <f>ⓣ</f>sound <f>[3]</f> doctrine,
1-11 in accordance with <f>ⓤ</f>the gospel of the glory of <f>ⓥ</f>the blessed God <f>ⓦ</f>with which I have been entrusted.
1-12 <pb/>I thank him <f>ⓧ</f>who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, <f>ⓨ</f>appointing me to his service,
1-13 though formerly I was a blasphemer, <f>ⓩ</f>persecutor, and insolent opponent. But <f>ⓐ</f>I received mercy <f>ⓑ</f>because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief,
1-14 and <f>ⓒ</f>the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the <f>ⓓ</f>faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
1-15 The saying is <f>ⓔ</f>trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus <f>ⓕ</f>came into the world to save sinners, <f>ⓖ</f>of whom I am the foremost.
1-16 But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life.
1-17 To <f>ⓗ</f>the King of the ages, <f>ⓘ</f>immortal, <f>ⓙ</f>invisible, <f>ⓚ</f>the only God, <f>ⓛ</f>be honor and glory forever and ever. <f>[4]</f> Amen.
1-18 <pb/>This charge <f>ⓜ</f>I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with <f>ⓝ</f>the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may <f>ⓞ</f>wage the good warfare,
1-19 <f>ⓟ</f> holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have <f>ⓠ</f>made shipwreck of their faith,
