10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head <f>ⓑ</f>and kissed him and said, “Has not the LORD anointed you to be prince <f>[1]</f> over <f>ⓒ</f>his people Israel? And you shall reign over the people of the LORD and you will save them from the hand of their surrounding enemies. And this shall be the sign to you that the LORD has anointed you to be prince <f>[2]</f> over his heritage.
10-2 When you depart from me today, you will meet two men by <f>ⓓ</f>Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, <f>ⓔ</f>‘The donkeys that you went to seek are found, and now <f>ⓕ</f>your father has ceased to care about the donkeys and is anxious about you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?”’
10-3 Then you shall go on from there farther and come to the <f>ⓖ</f>oak of Tabor. Three men <f>ⓗ</f>going up <f>ⓘ</f>to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.
10-4 And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand.
10-5 After that you shall come to <f>ⓙ</f>Gibeath-elohim, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>where there is a garrison of the Philistines. And there, as soon as you come to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down <f>ⓛ</f>from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying.
10-6 <f>ⓜ</f> Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, <f>ⓝ</f>and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man.
10-7 Now when <f>ⓞ</f>these signs meet you, do what your hand finds to do, <f>ⓟ</f>for God is with you.
10-8 Then go down before me <f>ⓠ</f>to Gilgal. And behold, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and <f>ⓡ</f>to sacrifice peace offerings. <f>ⓢ</f>Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do.”
10-9 <pb/>When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart. And all these signs came to pass that day.
10-10 When they came to <f>ⓣ</f>Gibeah, <f>[4]</f> behold, a group of prophets met him, <f>ⓤ</f>and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them.
10-11 And when all who knew him previously saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, “What has come over the son of Kish? <f>ⓥ</f>Is Saul also among the prophets?”
10-12 And a man of the place answered, <f>ⓦ</f>“And who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, <f>ⓧ</f>“Is Saul also among the prophets?”
10-13 When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
10-14 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, <f>ⓩ</f>“To seek the donkeys. And when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”
10-15 And Saul's uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”
10-16 And Saul said to his uncle, <f>ⓐ</f>“He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But about the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.
10-17 <pb/>Now Samuel called the people together <f>ⓑ</f>to the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>at Mizpah.
10-18 And he said to the people of Israel, <f>ⓓ</f>“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’
10-19 <f>ⓔ</f> But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said to him, ‘Set a king over us.’ Now therefore <f>ⓕ</f>present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousands.”
10-20 <pb/>Then Samuel <f>ⓖ</f>brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.
10-21 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was taken by lot; <f>[5]</f> and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
10-22 <f>ⓗ</f> So they inquired again of the LORD, “Is there a man still to come?” and the LORD said, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”
10-23 Then they ran and took him from there. And when he stood among the people, <f>ⓘ</f>he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
10-24 And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him <f>ⓙ</f>whom the LORD has chosen? There is none like him among all the people.” And all the people shouted, <f>ⓚ</f>“Long live the king!”
10-25 <pb/>Then Samuel told the people <f>ⓛ</f>the rights and duties of the kingship, and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the LORD. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his home.
10-26 Saul also went to his home <f>ⓜ</f>at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched.
10-27 But some <f>ⓝ</f>worthless fellows said, “How can this man save us?” And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
133-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Behold, how good and pleasant it is </t><t>when <f>ⓑ</f>brothers dwell in unity! <f>[1]</f></t>
133-2 <t>It is like the precious <f>ⓒ</f>oil on <f>ⓓ</f>the head, </t><t>running down on the beard, </t><t>on the beard of Aaron, </t><t>running down on <f>ⓔ</f>the collar of his robes!</t>
133-3 <t>It is like <f>ⓕ</f>the dew of <f>ⓖ</f>Hermon, </t><t>which falls on <f>ⓗ</f>the mountains of Zion! </t><t>For there the LORD <f>ⓘ</f>has commanded the blessing, </t><t>life forevermore. </t>
3-1 <pb/>In the fifteenth year of the reign of <f>ⓐ</f>Tiberius Caesar, <f>ⓑ</f>Pontius Pilate <f>ⓒ</f>being governor of Judea, and <f>ⓓ</f>Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
3-2 during <f>ⓔ</f>the high priesthood of Annas and <f>ⓕ</f>Caiaphas, <f>ⓖ</f>the word of God came to <f>ⓗ</f>John the son of Zechariah in <f>ⓘ</f>the wilderness.
3-3 And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming <f>ⓙ</f>a baptism of repentance <f>ⓚ</f>for the forgiveness of sins.
3-4 As it is written in <f>ⓛ</f>the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness: </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>‘Prepare the way of the Lord, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>make his paths straight.</t>
3-5 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Every valley shall be filled, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>and every mountain and hill shall be made low, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and the crooked shall become straight, </t><t>and the rough places shall become level ways,</t>
3-6 <t><f>ⓡ</f> and all flesh shall see <f>ⓢ</f>the salvation of God.’” </t>
3-7 <pb/>He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, <f>ⓣ</f>“You brood of <f>ⓤ</f>vipers! Who warned you to flee from <f>ⓥ</f>the wrath to come?
3-8 Bear fruits <f>ⓦ</f>in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, <f>ⓧ</f>‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from <f>ⓨ</f>these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
3-9 Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. <f>ⓩ</f>Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
3-10 <pb/>And the crowds asked him, <f>ⓐ</f>“What then shall we do?”
3-11 And he answered them, <f>ⓑ</f>“Whoever has two tunics <f>[2]</f> is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.”
3-12 <f>ⓒ</f> Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, “Teacher, <f>ⓓ</f>what shall we do?”
3-13 And he said to them, <f>ⓔ</f>“Collect no more than you are authorized to do.”
3-14 Soldiers also asked him, “And we, <f>ⓕ</f>what shall we do?” And he said to them, <f>ⓖ</f>“Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your <f>ⓗ</f>wages.”
3-15 <pb/>As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, <f>ⓘ</f>whether he might be <f>ⓙ</f>the Christ,
3-16 <f>ⓚ</f> John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but <f>ⓛ</f>he who is mightier than I is coming, <f>ⓜ</f>the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you <f>ⓝ</f>with the Holy Spirit and <f>ⓞ</f>fire.
3-17 His <f>ⓟ</f>winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to <f>ⓠ</f>gather the wheat into his barn, <f>ⓡ</f>but the chaff he will burn with <f>ⓢ</f>unquenchable fire.”
3-18 <pb/>So <f>ⓣ</f>with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.
3-19 But <f>ⓤ</f>Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,
3-20 added this to them all, that <f>ⓥ</f>he locked up John in prison.
3-21 <pb/>Now when all the people were baptized, and when <f>ⓦ</f>Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, <f>ⓧ</f>the heavens were opened,
3-22 and <f>ⓨ</f>the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and <f>ⓩ</f>a voice came from heaven, <f>ⓐ</f>“You are my beloved Son; <f>[3]</f> with you I am well pleased.” <f>[4]</f>
3-23 <pb/>Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>when he began his ministry, was about <f>ⓒ</f>thirty years of age, being <f>ⓓ</f>the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,
