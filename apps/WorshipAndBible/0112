2 Kings 9-1 <pb/>Then Elisha the prophet called one of <f>ⓐ</f>the sons of the prophets and said to him, <f>ⓑ</f>“Tie up your garments, and take this <f>ⓒ</f>flask of oil in your hand, and go to <f>ⓓ</f>Ramoth-gilead.
2 Kings 9-2 And when you arrive, look there for Jehu <f>ⓔ</f>the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. And go in and have him rise from among <f>ⓕ</f>his fellows, and lead him to an inner chamber.
2 Kings 9-3 Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, ‘Thus says the LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and flee; do not linger.”
2 Kings 9-4 <pb/>So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Kings 9-5 And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in council. And he said, “I have a word for you, O commander.” And Jehu said, “To which of us all?” And he said, “To you, O commander.”
2 Kings 9-6 So he arose and went into the house. And the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.
2 Kings 9-7 And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge <f>ⓘ</f>on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD.
2 Kings 9-8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, <f>ⓙ</f>and I will cut off from Ahab <f>ⓚ</f>every male, <f>ⓛ</f>bond or free, in Israel.
2 Kings 9-9 And I will make the house of Ahab like <f>ⓜ</f>the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like <f>ⓝ</f>the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
2 Kings 9-10 <f>ⓞ</f> And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her.” Then he opened the door and fled.
2 Kings 9-11 <pb/>When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him, <f>ⓟ</f>“Is all well? Why did <f>ⓠ</f>this mad fellow come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the fellow and his talk.”
2 Kings 9-12 And they said, “That is not true; tell us now.” And he said, “Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.’”
2 Kings 9-13 Then in haste <f>ⓡ</f>every man of them took his garment and put it under him on the bare <f>[1]</f> steps, and they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, <f>ⓢ</f>“Jehu is king.”
2 Kings 9-14 <pb/>Thus Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (<f>ⓣ</f>Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against <f>ⓤ</f>Hazael king of Syria,
2 Kings 9-15 <f>ⓥ</f> but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) So Jehu said, “If this is your decision, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.”
2 Kings 9-16 Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.
2 Kings 9-17 <pb/>Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came and said, “I see a company.” And Joram said, “Take a horseman and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”
2 Kings 9-18 So a man on horseback went to meet him and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’” And Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me.” And the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.”
2 Kings 9-19 Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, “Thus the king has said, ‘Is it peace?’” And Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me.”
2 Kings 9-20 Again the watchman reported, “He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the driving <f>ⓦ</f>is like the driving of Jehu <f>ⓧ</f>the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”
2 Kings 9-21 <pb/>Joram said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Make ready.” And they made ready his chariot. <f>ⓩ</f>Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu, and met him <f>ⓐ</f>at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2 Kings 9-22 And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?” He answered, “What peace can there be, so long as <f>ⓑ</f>the whorings and the sorceries of your mother Jezebel are so many?”
2 Kings 9-23 Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziah, “Treachery, O Ahaziah!”
2 Kings 9-24 And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank in his chariot.
2 Kings 9-25 Jehu said to Bidkar <f>ⓒ</f>his aide, “Take him up and throw him <f>ⓓ</f>on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD made this <f>ⓕ</f>pronouncement against him:
2 Kings 9-26 ‘As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons — declares the LORD — I will repay you on this plot of ground.’ Now therefore take him up and throw him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the LORD.”
2 Kings 9-27 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him and said, “Shoot him also.” And they shot him <f>[2]</f> in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by <f>ⓗ</f>Ibleam. And he fled to <f>ⓘ</f>Megiddo and died there.
2 Kings 9-28 <f>ⓙ</f> His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.
2 Kings 9-29 <pb/>In the <f>ⓚ</f>eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
2 Kings 9-30 <pb/>When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. And <f>ⓛ</f>she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked out of the window.
2 Kings 9-31 And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, <f>ⓜ</f>“Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?”
2 Kings 9-32 And he lifted up his face to the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
2 Kings 9-33 He said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down. And some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on her.
2 Kings 9-34 Then he went in and ate and drank. And he said, “See now to this cursed woman and bury her, <f>ⓝ</f>for she is a king's daughter.”
2 Kings 9-35 But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
2 Kings 9-36 When they came back and told him, he said, “This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite: <f>ⓞ</f>‘In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel,
2 Kings 9-37 and the corpse of Jezebel shall be <f>ⓟ</f>as dung on the face of the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is Jezebel.’”
Isaiah 8-1 <pb/>Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large tablet <f>ⓐ</f>and write on it in common characters, <f>[1]</f> ‘Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.’ <f>[2]</f>
Isaiah 8-2 And <f>ⓑ</f>I will get reliable witnesses, <f>ⓒ</f>Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me.”
Isaiah 8-3 <pb/>And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, <f>ⓓ</f>“Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
Isaiah 8-4 <f>ⓔ</f> for before the boy knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the <f>ⓕ</f>wealth of <f>ⓖ</f>Damascus and the spoil of <f>ⓗ</f>Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”
Isaiah 8-5 <pb/>The LORD spoke to me again:
Isaiah 8-6 “Because this people has refused the waters of <f>ⓘ</f>Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over <f>ⓙ</f>Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
Isaiah 8-7 therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them <f>ⓚ</f>the waters of <f>ⓛ</f>the River, <f>[3]</f> mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it <f>ⓜ</f>will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks,
Isaiah 8-8 and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, <f>ⓝ</f>reaching even to the neck, and its <f>ⓞ</f>outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, <f>ⓟ</f>O Immanuel.”
Isaiah 8-9 <pb/><t>Be broken, <f>[4]</f> you peoples, and <f>ⓠ</f>be shattered; <f>[5]</f> </t><t>give ear, all you far countries; </t><t>strap on your armor and be shattered; </t><t>strap on your armor and be shattered.</t>
Isaiah 8-10 <t>Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing; </t><t>speak a word, <f>ⓡ</f>but it will not stand, </t><t>for God <f>ⓢ</f>is with us. <f>[6]</f> </t>
Isaiah 8-11 <pb/>For the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and <f>ⓣ</f>warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:
Isaiah 8-12 “Do not call <f>ⓤ</f>conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and <f>ⓥ</f>do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.
Isaiah 8-13 But the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓦ</f>him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
Isaiah 8-14 And he will become a <f>ⓧ</f>sanctuary and <f>ⓨ</f>a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Isaiah 8-15 And many <f>ⓩ</f>shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”
Isaiah 8-16 <pb/>Bind up <f>ⓐ</f>the testimony; <f>ⓑ</f>seal the teaching <f>[7]</f> among my disciples.
Isaiah 8-17 I will <f>ⓒ</f>wait for the LORD, who is <f>ⓓ</f>hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.
Isaiah 8-18 <f>ⓔ</f> Behold, I and <f>ⓕ</f>the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
Isaiah 8-19 And when they say to you, “Inquire of the <f>ⓖ</f>mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of <f>ⓗ</f>the dead on behalf of the living?
Isaiah 8-20 <f>ⓘ</f> To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no <f>ⓙ</f>dawn.
Isaiah 8-21 They will pass through the land, <f>[8]</f> greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against <f>[9]</f> their king and their God, and turn their faces upward.
Isaiah 8-22 <f>ⓚ</f> And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into <f>ⓛ</f>thick darkness.
Romans 6-1 <pb/>What shall we say then? <f>ⓐ</f>Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
Romans 6-2 By no means! How can <f>ⓑ</f>we who died to sin still live in it?
Romans 6-3 Do you not know that all of us <f>ⓒ</f>who have been baptized <f>ⓓ</f>into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
Romans 6-4 We were <f>ⓔ</f>buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as <f>ⓕ</f>Christ was raised from the dead by <f>ⓖ</f>the glory of the Father, we too might walk in <f>ⓗ</f>newness of life.
Romans 6-5 <pb/>For <f>ⓘ</f>if we have been united with him in <f>ⓙ</f>a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
Romans 6-6 We know that <f>ⓚ</f>our old self <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>was crucified with him in order that <f>ⓜ</f>the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
Romans 6-7 For <f>ⓝ</f>one who has died <f>ⓞ</f>has been set free <f>[2]</f> from sin.
Romans 6-8 Now <f>ⓟ</f>if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
Romans 6-9 We know that <f>ⓠ</f>Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; <f>ⓡ</f>death no longer has dominion over him.
Romans 6-10 For the death he died he died to sin, <f>ⓢ</f>once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.
Romans 6-11 So you also must consider yourselves <f>ⓣ</f>dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
Romans 6-12 <pb/>Let not <f>ⓤ</f>sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.
Romans 6-13 <f>ⓥ</f> Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but <f>ⓦ</f>present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.
Romans 6-14 For <f>ⓧ</f>sin <f>ⓨ</f>will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.
Romans 6-15 <pb/>What then? <f>ⓩ</f>Are we to sin <f>ⓐ</f>because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!
Romans 6-16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves <f>ⓑ</f>to anyone as obedient slaves, <f>[3]</f> you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?
Romans 6-17 But <f>ⓒ</f>thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the <f>ⓓ</f>standard of teaching to which you were committed,
Romans 6-18 and, <f>ⓔ</f>having been set free from sin, <f>ⓕ</f>have become slaves of righteousness.
Romans 6-19 <f>ⓖ</f> I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For <f>ⓗ</f>just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members <f>ⓘ</f>as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.
Romans 6-20 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
Romans 6-21 <f>ⓚ</f> But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things <f>ⓛ</f>of which you are now ashamed? <f>ⓜ</f>For the end of those things is death.
Romans 6-22 But now that you <f>ⓝ</f>have been set free from sin and <f>ⓞ</f>have become slaves of God, <f>ⓟ</f>the fruit you get leads to sanctification and <f>ⓠ</f>its end, eternal life.
Romans 6-23 <f>ⓡ</f> For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
