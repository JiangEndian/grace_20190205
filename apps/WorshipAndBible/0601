7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “This is the law of the <f>ⓑ</f>guilt offering. <f>ⓒ</f>It is most holy.
7-2 <f>ⓓ</f> In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the guilt offering, and its blood shall be thrown against the sides of the altar.
7-3 And <f>ⓔ</f>all its fat shall be offered, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails,
7-4 the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the long lobe of the liver that he shall remove <f>ⓕ</f>with the kidneys.
7-5 The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
7-6 <f>ⓖ</f> Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. <f>ⓗ</f>It is most holy.
7-7 The <f>ⓘ</f>guilt offering is just like the sin offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.
7-8 And the priest who offers any man's burnt offering shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering that he has offered.
7-9 And <f>ⓙ</f>every grain offering baked <f>ⓚ</f>in the oven and all that is prepared <f>ⓛ</f>on a pan or a griddle shall belong to the priest who offers it.
7-10 And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall be shared equally among all the sons of Aaron.
7-11 <pb/>“And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that one may offer to the LORD.
7-12 If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice <f>ⓜ</f>unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and loaves of fine flour <f>ⓝ</f>well mixed with oil.
7-13 <f>ⓞ</f> With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving he shall bring his offering with loaves of leavened bread.
7-14 And from it he shall offer one loaf from each offering, as a <f>ⓟ</f>gift to the LORD. <f>ⓠ</f>It shall belong to the priest who throws the blood of the peace offerings.
7-15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings <f>ⓡ</f>for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.
7-16 But <f>ⓢ</f>if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow offering or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten.
7-17 But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned up with fire.
7-18 If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten on the third day, he who offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be credited to him. It is <f>ⓣ</f>tainted, and he who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
7-19 <pb/>“Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned up with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh,
7-20 but the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of the LORD's peace offerings <f>ⓤ</f>while an uncleanness is on him, that person shall be cut off from his people.
7-21 And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether <f>ⓥ</f>human uncleanness or an <f>ⓦ</f>unclean beast or any <f>ⓧ</f>unclean detestable creature, and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the LORD's peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people.”
7-22 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
7-23 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <f>ⓨ</f>You shall eat no fat, of ox or sheep or goat.
7-24 The fat of an animal <f>ⓩ</f>that dies of itself and the fat of one that is torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but on no account shall you eat it.
7-25 For every person who eats of the fat of an animal of which a food offering may be made to the LORD shall be cut off from his people.
7-26 Moreover, <f>ⓐ</f>you shall eat no blood whatever, whether of fowl or of animal, in any of your dwelling places.
7-27 Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.”
7-28 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
7-29 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, <f>ⓑ</f>Whoever offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
7-30 <f>ⓒ</f> His own hands shall bring the LORD's food offerings. He shall bring the fat with <f>ⓓ</f>the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the LORD.
7-31 <f>ⓔ</f> The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but <f>ⓕ</f>the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.
7-32 And <f>ⓖ</f>the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifice of your peace offerings.
7-33 Whoever among the sons of Aaron offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh for a portion.
7-34 For the breast that is <f>ⓗ</f>waved and the thigh that is <f>ⓘ</f>contributed I have taken from the people of Israel, out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and <f>ⓙ</f>have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a perpetual due from the people of Israel.
7-35 This is the portion of Aaron and of his sons from the LORD's food offerings, from the day they were presented to serve as priests of the LORD.
7-36 The LORD commanded this to be given them by the people of Israel, <f>ⓚ</f>from the day that he anointed them. It is a perpetual due throughout their generations.”
7-37 <pb/>This is the law <f>ⓛ</f>of the burnt offering, of the grain offering, of the sin offering, <f>ⓜ</f>of the guilt offering, <f>ⓝ</f>of the ordination offering, and <f>ⓞ</f>of the peace offering,
7-38 which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the people of Israel <f>ⓟ</f>to bring their offerings to the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.
26-1 <pb/>Then Job answered and said:
26-2 <pb/><t>“How you have <f>ⓐ</f>helped him who has no power! </t><t>How you have saved <f>ⓑ</f>the arm that has no strength!</t>
26-3 <t>How you have <f>ⓒ</f>counseled him who has no wisdom, </t><t>and plentifully declared sound knowledge!</t>
26-4 <t>With whose help have you uttered words, </t><t>and whose breath <f>ⓓ</f>has come out from you?</t>
26-5 <t>The <f>ⓔ</f>dead tremble </t><t>under the waters and their inhabitants.</t>
26-6 <t>Sheol is <f>ⓕ</f>naked before God, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>Abaddon has no covering.</t>
26-7 <t>He <f>ⓗ</f>stretches out the north over <f>ⓘ</f>the void </t><t>and hangs the earth on nothing.</t>
26-8 <t>He <f>ⓙ</f>binds up the waters in his thick clouds, </t><t>and the cloud is not split open under them.</t>
26-9 <t>He covers the face of the full moon <f>[2]</f> </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>spreads over it his cloud.</t>
26-10 <t>He has inscribed <f>ⓛ</f>a circle on the face of the waters </t><t>at the boundary between light and darkness.</t>
26-11 <t><f>ⓜ</f> The pillars of heaven tremble </t><t>and are astounded at his <f>ⓝ</f>rebuke.</t>
26-12 <t>By his power he <f>ⓞ</f>stilled the sea; </t><t>by his understanding he shattered <f>ⓟ</f>Rahab.</t>
26-13 <t><f>ⓠ</f> By his wind the heavens were made fair; </t><t>his hand pierced <f>ⓡ</f>the fleeing serpent.</t>
26-14 <t>Behold, these are but the outskirts of his <f>ⓢ</f>ways, </t><t>and how small <f>ⓣ</f>a whisper do we hear of him! </t><t>But the thunder of his power who can understand?” </t>
25-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
25-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>set your face toward <f>ⓒ</f>the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
25-3 Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: <f>ⓓ</f>Thus says the Lord GOD, Because you said, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Aha!’ over my <f>ⓕ</f>sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile,
25-4 therefore behold, I am handing you over to <f>ⓖ</f>the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
25-5 I will make <f>ⓗ</f>Rabbah a <f>ⓘ</f>pasture for camels and Ammon <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓙ</f>a fold for flocks. <f>ⓚ</f>Then you will know that I am the LORD.
25-6 For thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓛ</f>you have clapped your hands <f>ⓜ</f>and stamped your feet and <f>ⓝ</f>rejoiced with all the <f>ⓞ</f>malice within your soul against the land of Israel,
25-7 therefore, behold, <f>ⓟ</f>I have stretched out my hand against you, and <f>ⓠ</f>will hand you over as plunder to the nations. And I will cut you off from the peoples and will make you perish out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
25-8 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓡ</f>Moab and <f>ⓢ</f>Seir <f>[2]</f> said, ‘Behold, the <f>ⓣ</f>house of Judah is like all the other nations,’
25-9 therefore <f>ⓤ</f>I will lay open the flank of Moab from the cities, from its cities on its frontier, the glory of the country, <f>ⓥ</f>Beth-jeshimoth, <f>ⓦ</f>Baal-meon, and <f>ⓧ</f>Kiriathaim.
25-10 I will give it <f>ⓨ</f>along with the Ammonites <f>ⓩ</f>to the people of the East as a possession, <f>ⓐ</f>that the Ammonites may be remembered no more among the nations,
25-11 <f>ⓑ</f> and I will execute judgments upon Moab. <f>ⓒ</f>Then they will know that I am the LORD.
25-12 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓓ</f>Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and has grievously offended <f>ⓔ</f>in taking vengeance on them,
25-13 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, <f>ⓕ</f>I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it man and beast. And I will make it desolate; from <f>ⓖ</f>Teman even to <f>ⓗ</f>Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
25-14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom <f>ⓘ</f>by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath, and <f>ⓙ</f>they shall know my vengeance, declares the Lord GOD.
25-15 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: Because <f>ⓚ</f>the Philistines <f>ⓛ</f>acted revengefully and took vengeance <f>ⓜ</f>with malice of soul to destroy in never-ending enmity,
25-16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, <f>ⓝ</f>Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off <f>ⓞ</f>the Cherethites and destroy the rest of the seacoast.
25-17 I will execute great vengeance on them <f>ⓟ</f>with wrathful rebukes. <f>ⓠ</f>Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon them.”
