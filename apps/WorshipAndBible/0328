Genesis 32-1 <pb/>Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Genesis 32-2 And when Jacob saw them he said, “This is God's <f>ⓐ</f>camp!” So he called the name of that place <f>ⓑ</f>Mahanaim. <f>[1]</f>
Genesis 32-3 <pb/>And Jacob sent <f>[2]</f> messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of <f>ⓒ</f>Seir, the country of Edom,
Genesis 32-4 instructing them, “Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, ‘I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now.
Genesis 32-5 I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that <f>ⓓ</f>I may find favor in your sight.’”
Genesis 32-6 <pb/>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and <f>ⓔ</f>he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.”
Genesis 32-7 Then Jacob was <f>ⓕ</f>greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,
Genesis 32-8 thinking, “If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape.”
Genesis 32-9 <pb/>And Jacob said, <f>ⓖ</f>“O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who <f>ⓗ</f>said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,’
Genesis 32-10 <f>ⓘ</f> I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
Genesis 32-11 Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for <f>ⓙ</f>I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children.
Genesis 32-12 But <f>ⓚ</f>you said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’”
Genesis 32-13 <pb/>So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took <f>ⓛ</f>a present for his brother Esau,
Genesis 32-14 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
Genesis 32-15 thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
Genesis 32-16 These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove.”
Genesis 32-17 He instructed the first, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, ‘To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?’
Genesis 32-18 then you shall say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.’”
Genesis 32-19 He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, “You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him,
Genesis 32-20 and you shall say, ‘Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.’” For he thought, “I may appease him <f>[3]</f> with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.” <f>[4]</f>
Genesis 32-21 So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.
Genesis 32-22 <pb/>The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, <f>[5]</f> and crossed the ford of the <f>ⓜ</f>Jabbok.
Genesis 32-23 He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had.
Genesis 32-24 And Jacob was left alone. And <f>ⓝ</f>a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
Genesis 32-25 When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
Genesis 32-26 Then he said, “Let me go, for the day has broken.” But Jacob said, <f>ⓞ</f>“I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
Genesis 32-27 And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”
Genesis 32-28 Then he said, <f>ⓟ</f>“Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, <f>[6]</f> for <f>ⓠ</f>you have striven with God and <f>ⓡ</f>with men, and have prevailed.”
Genesis 32-29 Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” But he said, <f>ⓢ</f>“Why is it that you ask my name?” And there he blessed him.
Genesis 32-30 So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, <f>[7]</f> saying, “For <f>ⓣ</f>I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.”
Genesis 32-31 The sun rose upon him as he passed <f>ⓤ</f>Penuel, limping because of his hip.
Genesis 32-32 Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh.
2 Chronicles 30-1 <pb/>Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 30-2 For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover <f>ⓐ</f>in the second month —
2 Chronicles 30-3 for they could not keep it <f>ⓑ</f>at that time <f>ⓒ</f>because the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people assembled in Jerusalem —
2 Chronicles 30-4 and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles 30-5 So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, <f>ⓓ</f>from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem, for they had not kept it as often as prescribed.
2 Chronicles 30-6 <f>ⓔ</f> So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, “O people of Israel, <f>ⓕ</f>return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of <f>ⓖ</f>the kings of Assyria.
2 Chronicles 30-7 <f>ⓗ</f> Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were faithless to the LORD God of their fathers, so that he made them a desolation, as you see.
2 Chronicles 30-8 <f>ⓘ</f> Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD and come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever, and serve the LORD your God, <f>ⓙ</f>that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
2 Chronicles 30-9 For <f>ⓚ</f>if you return to the LORD, your brothers and your children <f>ⓛ</f>will find compassion with their captors and return to this land. For <f>ⓜ</f>the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you, <f>ⓝ</f>if you return to him.”
2 Chronicles 30-10 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> So the couriers went from city to city through the country of <f>ⓟ</f>Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but <f>ⓠ</f>they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.
2 Chronicles 30-11 However, <f>ⓡ</f>some men of Asher, of Manasseh, and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 30-12 The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded <f>ⓢ</f>by the word of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 30-13 <pb/>And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread <f>ⓣ</f>in the second month, a very great assembly.
2 Chronicles 30-14 They set to work and removed <f>ⓤ</f>the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for burning incense they took away <f>ⓥ</f>and threw into the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles 30-15 <f>ⓦ</f> And they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. <f>ⓧ</f>And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, <f>ⓨ</f>so that they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 30-16 <f>ⓩ</f> They took their accustomed posts according to the Law of Moses <f>ⓐ</f>the man of God. The priests threw the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites.
2 Chronicles 30-17 For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves. Therefore the Levites had to slaughter the Passover lamb for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate it to the LORD.
2 Chronicles 30-18 For a majority of the people, <f>ⓑ</f>many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise <f>ⓒ</f>than as prescribed. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good LORD pardon everyone
2 Chronicles 30-19 <f>ⓓ</f> who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD, the God of his fathers, even though not according to the sanctuary's rules of cleanness.” <f>[1]</f>
2 Chronicles 30-20 And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
2 Chronicles 30-21 And the people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept <f>ⓔ</f>the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness, and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with all their might <f>[2]</f> to the LORD.
2 Chronicles 30-22 And Hezekiah spoke <f>ⓕ</f>encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the LORD. So they ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing <f>ⓖ</f>peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 30-23 <pb/>Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast <f>ⓗ</f>for another seven days. So they kept it for another seven days with gladness.
2 Chronicles 30-24 For Hezekiah king of Judah <f>ⓘ</f>gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep. And the priests <f>ⓙ</f>consecrated themselves in great numbers.
2 Chronicles 30-25 The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, <f>ⓚ</f>and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and the sojourners who lived in Judah, rejoiced.
2 Chronicles 30-26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for <f>ⓛ</f>since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 30-27 Then <f>ⓜ</f>the priests and the Levites arose and <f>ⓝ</f>blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to <f>ⓞ</f>his holy habitation in heaven.
Jeremiah 17-1 <pb/>“The sin of Judah is written with <f>ⓐ</f>a pen of iron; with a point of diamond it is engraved on <f>ⓑ</f>the tablet of their heart, and on <f>ⓒ</f>the horns of their altars,
Jeremiah 17-2 while <f>ⓓ</f>their children remember their altars and their <f>ⓔ</f>Asherim, <f>ⓕ</f>beside every green tree and on the high hills,
Jeremiah 17-3 <f>ⓖ</f> on the mountains in the open country. <f>ⓗ</f>Your wealth and all your treasures I will give for spoil as the price of your high places for sin throughout all your territory.
Jeremiah 17-4 You shall loosen your hand from your heritage that I gave to you, <f>ⓘ</f>and I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, <f>ⓙ</f>for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.”
Jeremiah 17-5 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t>“Cursed is the man <f>ⓚ</f>who trusts in man </t><t>and makes flesh his strength, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>whose heart turns away from the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 17-6 <t><f>ⓛ</f> He is like a shrub in the desert, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and shall not see any good come. </t><t>He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness, </t><t>in <f>ⓝ</f>an uninhabited salt land. </t>
Jeremiah 17-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>whose trust is the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 17-8 <t><f>ⓠ</f> He is like a tree planted by water, </t><t>that sends out its roots by the stream, </t><t>and does not fear when heat comes, </t><t>for its leaves remain green, </t><t>and is not anxious in the year of drought, </t><t>for it does not cease to bear fruit.” </t>
Jeremiah 17-9 <pb/><t>The heart is deceitful above all things, </t><t>and desperately sick; </t><t>who can understand it?</t>
Jeremiah 17-10 <t><f>ⓡ</f> “I the LORD search the heart </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>and test the mind, <f>[2]</f> </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>to give every man according to his ways, </t><t>according to the fruit of his deeds.” </t>
Jeremiah 17-11 <pb/><t>Like the <f>ⓤ</f>partridge that gathers a brood that she did not hatch, </t><t>so is <f>ⓥ</f>he who gets riches but not by justice; </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>in the midst of his days they will leave him, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and at his end he will be a fool. </t>
Jeremiah 17-12 <pb/><t>A glorious throne set on high from the beginning </t><t>is the place of our sanctuary.</t>
Jeremiah 17-13 <t>O LORD, <f>ⓨ</f>the hope of Israel, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>all who forsake you shall be put to shame; </t><t>those who turn away from you <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>shall be written in the earth, </t><t>for <f>ⓑ</f>they have forsaken <f>ⓒ</f>the LORD, the fountain of living water. </t>

Jeremiah 17-19 <pb/>Thus said the LORD to me: “Go and stand in the People's Gate, by which <f>ⓜ</f>the kings of Judah enter and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem,
Jeremiah 17-20 and say: ‘Hear the word of the LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates.
Jeremiah 17-21 Thus says the LORD: Take care for the sake of your lives, and <f>ⓞ</f>do not bear a burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 17-22 And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath <f>ⓟ</f>or do any work, but <f>ⓠ</f>keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers.
Jeremiah 17-23 Yet <f>ⓡ</f>they did not listen or incline their ear, <f>ⓢ</f>but stiffened their neck, that they <f>ⓣ</f>might not hear and receive instruction.
Jeremiah 17-24 <pb/>“‘But if you listen to me, declares the LORD, and <f>ⓤ</f>bring in no burden by the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but <f>ⓥ</f>keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work on it,
Jeremiah 17-25 then <f>ⓦ</f>there shall enter by the gates of this city kings and princes who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall be inhabited forever.
Jeremiah 17-26 And people shall come from <f>ⓧ</f>the cities of Judah <f>ⓨ</f>and the places around Jerusalem, <f>ⓩ</f>from the land of Benjamin, <f>ⓐ</f>from the Shephelah, from the hill country, <f>ⓑ</f>and from <f>ⓒ</f>the Negeb, bringing <f>ⓓ</f>burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and <f>ⓔ</f>bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah 17-27 But if you do not listen to me, to <f>ⓕ</f>keep the Sabbath day holy, <f>ⓖ</f>and not to bear a burden and enter by the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will <f>ⓗ</f>kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall <f>ⓘ</f>devour the palaces of Jerusalem and <f>ⓙ</f>shall not be quenched.’”
2 Timothy 3-1 <pb/>But understand this, that <f>ⓐ</f>in the last days there will come times of difficulty.
2 Timothy 3-2 For people will be <f>ⓑ</f>lovers of self, <f>ⓒ</f>lovers of money, <f>ⓓ</f>proud, <f>ⓔ</f>arrogant, abusive, <f>ⓕ</f>disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
2 Timothy 3-3 <f>ⓖ</f> heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, <f>ⓗ</f>not loving good,
2 Timothy 3-4 treacherous, reckless, <f>ⓘ</f>swollen with conceit, <f>ⓙ</f>lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
2 Timothy 3-5 having the appearance of godliness, but <f>ⓚ</f>denying its power. <f>ⓛ</f>Avoid such people.
2 Timothy 3-6 For among them are <f>ⓜ</f>those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions,
2 Timothy 3-7 always learning and never able to <f>ⓝ</f>arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy 3-8 Just as <f>ⓞ</f>Jannes and Jambres <f>ⓟ</f>opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, <f>ⓠ</f>men corrupted in mind and <f>ⓡ</f>disqualified regarding the faith.
2 Timothy 3-9 But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, <f>ⓢ</f>as was that of those two men.
2 Timothy 3-10 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,

2 Timothy 3-12 Indeed, all who desire to <f>ⓩ</f>live a godly life in Christ Jesus <f>ⓐ</f>will be persecuted,
2 Timothy 3-13 while <f>ⓑ</f>evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and <f>ⓒ</f>being deceived.
2 Timothy 3-14 But as for you, <f>ⓓ</f>continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom <f>[1]</f> you learned it
2 Timothy 3-15 and how <f>ⓔ</f>from childhood you have been acquainted with <f>ⓕ</f>the sacred writings, <f>ⓖ</f>which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy 3-16 <f>ⓗ</f> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
