Genesis 35-1 <pb/>God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to <f>ⓐ</f>Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you <f>ⓑ</f>when you fled from your brother Esau.”
Genesis 35-2 So Jacob said to his <f>ⓒ</f>household and to all who were with him, “Put away <f>ⓓ</f>the foreign gods that are among you and <f>ⓔ</f>purify yourselves and change your garments.
Genesis 35-3 Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God <f>ⓕ</f>who answers me in the day of my distress and <f>ⓖ</f>has been with me wherever I have gone.”
Genesis 35-4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under <f>ⓗ</f>the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.
Genesis 35-5 <pb/>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
Genesis 35-6 And Jacob came to <f>ⓘ</f>Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,
Genesis 35-7 and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, <f>[1]</f> because <f>ⓙ</f>there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.
Genesis 35-8 And <f>ⓚ</f>Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth. <f>[2]</f>
Genesis 35-9 <pb/>God appeared <f>[3]</f> to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
Genesis 35-10 And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; <f>ⓛ</f>no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but <f>ⓜ</f>Israel shall be your name.” So he called his name Israel.
Genesis 35-11 And God said to him, <f>ⓝ</f>“I am God Almighty: <f>[4]</f> be <f>ⓞ</f>fruitful and multiply. <f>ⓟ</f>A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body. <f>[5]</f>
Genesis 35-12 <f>ⓠ</f> The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.”
Genesis 35-13 Then God <f>ⓡ</f>went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.
Genesis 35-14 And Jacob <f>ⓢ</f>set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.
Genesis 35-15 So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him <f>ⓣ</f>Bethel.
Genesis 35-16 <pb/>Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance <f>[6]</f> from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor.
Genesis 35-17 And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for <f>ⓤ</f>you have another son.”
Genesis 35-18 And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>but his father called him Benjamin. <f>[8]</f>
Genesis 35-19 So <f>ⓦ</f>Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to <f>ⓧ</f>Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),
Genesis 35-20 and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is <f>ⓨ</f>the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.
Genesis 35-21 Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis 35-22 <pb/>While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and <f>ⓩ</f>lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard of it. <pb/>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
Genesis 35-23 The sons of Leah: <f>ⓐ</f>Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
Genesis 35-24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis 35-25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali.
Genesis 35-26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
Genesis 35-27 <pb/>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at <f>ⓑ</f>Mamre, or <f>ⓒ</f>Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
Genesis 35-28 Now the days of Isaac were 180 years.
Genesis 35-29 And Isaac breathed his last, and he died <f>ⓓ</f>and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And <f>ⓔ</f>his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
2 Chronicles 33-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 33-2 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to <f>ⓑ</f>the abominations of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33-3 For he rebuilt the high places <f>ⓒ</f>that his father Hezekiah had broken down, and he erected altars to the Baals, and made <f>ⓓ</f>Asheroth, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.
2 Chronicles 33-4 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, <f>ⓔ</f>“In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.”
2 Chronicles 33-5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in <f>ⓕ</f>the two courts of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 33-6 <f>ⓖ</f> And he burned his sons as an offering <f>ⓗ</f>in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and <f>ⓘ</f>used fortune-telling and omens and sorcery, and dealt with <f>ⓙ</f>mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
2 Chronicles 33-7 And <f>ⓚ</f>the carved image of the idol that he had made he set in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, <f>ⓛ</f>I will put my name forever,
2 Chronicles 33-8 and I will no more remove the foot of Israel from the land <f>ⓜ</f>that I appointed for your fathers, if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them, all the law, the statutes, and the rules given through Moses.”
2 Chronicles 33-9 Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, to do more evil than the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the people of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33-10 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they paid no attention.
2 Chronicles 33-11 <f>ⓝ</f> Therefore the LORD brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh with hooks and <f>ⓞ</f>bound him with chains of bronze and brought him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles 33-12 And when he was in distress, he entreated the favor of the LORD his God <f>ⓟ</f>and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles 33-13 He prayed to him, and <f>ⓠ</f>God was moved by his entreaty and heard his plea and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. <f>ⓡ</f>Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God.
2 Chronicles 33-14 <pb/>Afterward he built an outer wall for the city of David west of <f>ⓢ</f>Gihon, in the valley, and for the entrance into <f>ⓣ</f>the Fish Gate, and carried it around <f>ⓤ</f>Ophel, and raised it to a very great height. He also put commanders of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah.
2 Chronicles 33-15 And <f>ⓥ</f>he took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built on the mountain of the house of the LORD and in Jerusalem, and he threw them outside of the city.
2 Chronicles 33-16 He also restored the altar of the LORD and offered on it sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and he commanded Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33-17 <f>ⓦ</f> Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.
2 Chronicles 33-18 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and <f>ⓧ</f>his prayer to his God, and the words of <f>ⓨ</f>the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, behold, they are in the <f>ⓩ</f>Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33-19 And his prayer, and how <f>ⓐ</f>God was moved by his entreaty, and all his sin and his faithlessness, and the sites <f>ⓑ</f>on which he built high places and set up the <f>ⓒ</f>Asherim and the images, before <f>ⓓ</f>he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the Chronicles of the Seers. <f>[1]</f>
2 Chronicles 33-20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his house, and Amon his son reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 33-21 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 33-22 And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done. Amon sacrificed to all the images <f>ⓕ</f>that Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
2 Chronicles 33-23 And he did not humble himself before the LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>as Manasseh his father had humbled himself, but this Amon incurred guilt more and more.
2 Chronicles 33-24 And his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his house.
2 Chronicles 33-25 But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon. And the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
Jeremiah 20-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>Pashhur the priest, the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Immer, who was <f>ⓒ</f>chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
Jeremiah 20-2 Then <f>ⓓ</f>Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him <f>ⓔ</f>in the stocks that were in the upper <f>ⓕ</f>Benjamin Gate of the house of the LORD.
Jeremiah 20-3 The next day, when <f>ⓖ</f>Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD does not call your name <f>ⓗ</f>Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side.
Jeremiah 20-4 For thus says the LORD: Behold, I will make you <f>ⓘ</f>a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword.
Jeremiah 20-5 Moreover, <f>ⓙ</f>I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its <f>ⓚ</f>prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
Jeremiah 20-6 And you, <f>ⓛ</f>Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, <f>ⓜ</f>to whom you have prophesied falsely.”
Jeremiah 20-7 <pb/><t>O LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>you have deceived me, </t><t>and I was deceived; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>you are stronger than I, </t><t>and you have prevailed. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>I have become a laughingstock all the day; </t><t>everyone mocks me.</t>
Jeremiah 20-8 <t>For whenever I speak, I cry out, </t><t>I shout, <f>ⓠ</f>“Violence and destruction!” </t><t>For <f>ⓡ</f>the word of the LORD has become for me </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>a reproach and <f>ⓣ</f>derision all day long.</t>
Jeremiah 20-9 <t>If I say, “I will not mention him, </t><t>or speak any more in his name,” </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>there is in my heart as it were a burning fire </t><t>shut up in my bones, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>I am weary with holding it in, </t><t>and I cannot.</t>
Jeremiah 20-10 <t><f>ⓦ</f> For I hear many whispering. </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>Terror is on every side! </t><t>“Denounce him! <f>ⓨ</f>Let us denounce him!” </t><t>say all my <f>ⓩ</f>close friends, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>watching for <f>ⓑ</f>my fall. </t><t>“Perhaps he will be deceived; </t><t>then <f>ⓒ</f>we can overcome him </t><t>and take our revenge on him.”</t>
Jeremiah 20-11 <t>But <f>ⓓ</f>the LORD is with me as a dread warrior; </t><t>therefore my persecutors will stumble; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>they will not overcome me. </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>They will be greatly shamed, </t><t>for they will not succeed. </t><t>Their <f>ⓖ</f>eternal dishonor </t><t>will never be forgotten.</t>
Jeremiah 20-12 <t>O LORD of hosts, who tests the righteous, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>who sees the heart and the mind, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>let me see your vengeance upon them, </t><t>for to you have I committed my cause. </t>
Jeremiah 20-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Sing to the LORD; </t><t>praise the LORD! </t><t>For he has delivered the life of the needy </t><t>from the hand of evildoers. </t>
Jeremiah 20-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> Cursed be the day </t><t>on which I was born! </t><t>The day when my mother bore me, </t><t>let it not be blessed!</t>
Jeremiah 20-15 <t>Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, </t><t>“A son is born to you,” </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>making him very glad.</t>
Jeremiah 20-16 <t>Let that man be like <f>ⓛ</f>the cities </t><t>that the LORD overthrew without pity; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>let him hear a cry in the morning </t><t>and an alarm at noon,</t>
Jeremiah 20-17 <t><f>ⓝ</f> because he did not kill me in the womb; </t><t>so my mother would have been my grave, </t><t>and her womb forever great.</t>
Jeremiah 20-18 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Why did I come out from the womb </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>to see toil and sorrow, </t><t>and spend my days in shame? </t>
Titus 2-1 <pb/>But as for you, teach what accords with <f>ⓐ</f>sound <f>[1]</f> doctrine.
Titus 2-2 Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, <f>ⓑ</f>sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.
Titus 2-3 <f>ⓒ</f> Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, <f>ⓓ</f>not slanderers <f>ⓔ</f>or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good,
Titus 2-4 and so train the young women to love their husbands and children,
Titus 2-5 to be self-controlled, <f>ⓕ</f>pure, <f>ⓖ</f>working at home, kind, and <f>ⓗ</f>submissive to their own husbands, <f>ⓘ</f>that the word of God may not be reviled.
Titus 2-6 Likewise, urge <f>ⓙ</f>the younger men to be self-controlled.
Titus 2-7 Show yourself in all respects to be <f>ⓚ</f>a model of good works, and in your teaching <f>ⓛ</f>show integrity, <f>ⓜ</f>dignity,
Titus 2-8 and <f>ⓝ</f>sound speech that cannot be condemned, <f>ⓞ</f>so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.
Titus 2-9 <f>ⓟ</f> Bondservants <f>[2]</f> are to be submissive to their own masters <f>ⓠ</f>in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,
Titus 2-10 not pilfering, <f>ⓡ</f>but showing all good faith, <f>ⓢ</f>so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.
Titus 2-11 <pb/>For <f>ⓣ</f>the grace of God <f>ⓤ</f>has appeared, bringing salvation <f>ⓥ</f>for all people,
Titus 2-12 training us to renounce ungodliness and <f>ⓦ</f>worldly passions, and <f>ⓧ</f>to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in <f>ⓨ</f>the present age,
Titus 2-13 <f>ⓩ</f> waiting for our blessed <f>ⓐ</f>hope, the <f>ⓑ</f>appearing of the glory of our great <f>ⓒ</f>God and Savior Jesus Christ,
Titus 2-14 <f>ⓓ</f> who gave himself for us to <f>ⓔ</f>redeem us from all lawlessness and <f>ⓕ</f>to purify for himself <f>ⓖ</f>a people for his own possession who are <f>ⓗ</f>zealous for good works.
Titus 2-15 <pb/>Declare these things; exhort and <f>ⓘ</f>rebuke with all authority. <f>ⓙ</f>Let no one disregard you.
