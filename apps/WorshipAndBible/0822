26-1 <pb/>“When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance and have taken possession of it and live in it,
26-2 <f>ⓐ</f> you shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you harvest from your land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall put it in a basket, and you shall <f>ⓑ</f>go to the place that the LORD your God will choose, to make his name to dwell there.
26-3 And you shall go to the priest who is in office at that time and say to him, ‘I declare today to the LORD your God that I have come into the land <f>ⓒ</f>that the LORD swore to our fathers to give us.’
26-4 Then the priest shall take the basket from your hand and set it down before the altar of the LORD your God.
26-5 <pb/>“And you shall make response before the LORD your God, ‘A <f>ⓓ</f>wandering Aramean was my father. And he went down into Egypt and sojourned there, <f>ⓔ</f>few in number, and there he became a nation, great, mighty, and populous.
26-6 And <f>ⓕ</f>the Egyptians treated us harshly and humiliated us and laid on us hard labor.
26-7 Then <f>ⓖ</f>we cried to the LORD, the God of our fathers, and the LORD heard our voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.
26-8 And <f>ⓗ</f>the LORD brought us out of Egypt <f>ⓘ</f>with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great deeds of terror, <f>[1]</f> with signs and wonders.
26-9 And he brought us into this place and gave us this land, <f>ⓙ</f>a land flowing with milk and honey.
26-10 And behold, now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, O LORD, have given me.’ And you shall set it down before the LORD your God and worship before the LORD your God.
26-11 And <f>ⓚ</f>you shall rejoice in all the good that the LORD your God has given to you and to your house, you, and the Levite, and the sojourner who is among you.
26-12 <pb/>“When you have finished paying all <f>ⓛ</f>the tithe of your produce in the third year, which is <f>ⓜ</f>the year of tithing, giving it to the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that they may eat within your towns and be filled,
26-13 then you shall say before the LORD your God, ‘I have removed the sacred portion out of my house, and moreover, I have given it to the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all your commandment that you have commanded me. I have not transgressed any of your commandments, <f>ⓝ</f>nor have I forgotten them.
26-14 <f>ⓞ</f> I have not eaten of the tithe while I was mourning, or removed any of it while I was unclean, or offered any of it <f>ⓟ</f>to the dead. I have obeyed the voice of the LORD my God. I have done according to all that you have commanded me.
26-15 <f>ⓠ</f> Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel and the ground that you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.’
26-16 <pb/>“This day the LORD your God commands you to do these statutes and rules. You shall therefore be careful to do them with all your heart and with all your soul.
26-17 <f>ⓡ</f> You have declared today that the LORD is your God, and that you will walk in his ways, and keep his statutes and his commandments and his rules, and will obey his voice.
26-18 And the LORD has declared today that you are <f>ⓢ</f>a people for his treasured possession, as he has promised you, and that you are to keep all his commandments,
26-19 and that he will set you in praise and in fame and in honor <f>ⓣ</f>high above all nations <f>ⓤ</f>that he has made, and that you shall be <f>ⓥ</f>a people holy to the LORD your God, as he promised.”
66-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Shout for joy to God, all the earth;</t>
66-2 <t>sing the glory of his name; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>give to him glorious praise!</t>
66-3 <t>Say to God, <f>ⓒ</f>“How awesome are your deeds! </t><t>So great is your power that your enemies <f>ⓓ</f>come cringing to you.</t>
66-4 <t><f>ⓔ</f> All the earth worships you </t><t>and sings praises to you; </t><t>they sing praises to your name.” <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
66-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> Come and see what God has done: </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man.</t>
66-6 <t>He <f>ⓗ</f>turned the sea into dry land; </t><t>they <f>ⓘ</f>passed through the river on foot. </t><t>There did we rejoice in him,</t>
66-7 <t>who rules by his might forever, </t><t>whose <f>ⓙ</f>eyes keep watch on the nations — </t><t>let not the rebellious exalt themselves. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
66-8 <pb/><t>Bless our God, O peoples; </t><t>let the sound of his praise be heard,</t>
66-9 <t>who has kept our soul among the living </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>has not let our feet slip.</t>
66-10 <t>For you, O God, have <f>ⓛ</f>tested us; </t><t>you have tried us as silver is tried.</t>
66-11 <t>You brought us into <f>ⓜ</f>the net; </t><t>you laid a crushing burden on our backs;</t>
66-12 <t>you let men <f>ⓝ</f>ride over our heads; </t><t>we went through fire and through <f>ⓞ</f>water; </t><t>yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance. </t>
66-13 <pb/><t>I will come into your house with burnt offerings; </t><t>I will <f>ⓟ</f>perform my vows to you,</t>
66-14 <t>that which my lips uttered </t><t>and my mouth promised <f>ⓠ</f>when I was in trouble.</t>
66-15 <t>I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals, </t><t>with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; </t><t>I will make an offering of bulls and goats. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
66-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f> Come and hear, all you who fear God, </t><t>and I will tell what he has done for my soul.</t>
66-17 <t>I cried to him with my mouth, </t><t>and high praise was on <f>[1]</f> my tongue. <f>[2]</f></t>
66-18 <t>If I had <f>ⓢ</f>cherished iniquity in my heart, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>the Lord would not have listened.</t>
66-19 <t>But truly <f>ⓤ</f>God has listened; </t><t>he has attended to the voice of my prayer. </t>
66-20 <pb/><t>Blessed be God, </t><t>because he has not rejected my prayer </t><t>or removed his steadfast love from me! </t>
3-1 <pb/><t>Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>the oppressing city!</t>
3-2 <t>She listens to no voice; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>she accepts no correction. </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>She does not trust in the LORD; </t><t>she does not draw near to her God. </t>
3-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> Her officials within her </t><t>are roaring lions; </t><t>her judges are <f>ⓔ</f>evening wolves </t><t>that leave nothing till the morning.</t>
3-4 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Her prophets are fickle, treacherous men; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>her priests <f>ⓗ</f>profane what is holy; </t><t>they do violence to the law.</t>
3-5 <t>The LORD within her <f>ⓘ</f>is righteous; </t><t>he does no injustice; </t><t>every morning he shows forth his justice; </t><t>each dawn he does not fail; </t><t>but <f>ⓙ</f>the unjust knows no shame. </t>
3-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> “I have cut off nations; </t><t>their battlements are in ruins; </t><t>I have laid waste their streets </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>so that no one walks in them; </t><t>their cities have been made desolate, </t><t>without a man, without an inhabitant.</t>
3-7 <t><f>ⓜ</f> I said, ‘Surely you will fear me; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>you will accept correction. </t><t>Then your <f>[1]</f> dwelling would not be cut off </t><t>according to all that I have appointed against you.’ <f>[2]</f> </t><t>But <f>ⓞ</f>all the more they were eager </t><t>to make all their deeds corrupt. </t>
