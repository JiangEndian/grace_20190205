20-1 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Joshua,
20-2 “Say to the people of Israel, <f>ⓐ</f>‘Appoint the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,
20-3 that the manslayer who strikes any person without intent or unknowingly may flee there. They shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood.
20-4 He shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand <f>ⓑ</f>at the entrance of the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city. Then they shall take him into the city and give him a place, and he shall remain with them.
20-5 And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not give up the manslayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unknowingly, and did not hate him in the past.
20-6 And he shall remain in that city <f>ⓒ</f>until he has stood before the congregation for judgment, until the death of him who is high priest at the time. Then the manslayer may return to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.’”
20-7 <pb/>So they set apart <f>ⓓ</f>Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and <f>ⓔ</f>Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and <f>ⓕ</f>Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) <f>ⓖ</f>in the hill country of Judah.
20-8 And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed <f>ⓗ</f>Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland, from the tribe of Reuben, and <f>ⓘ</f>Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and <f>ⓙ</f>Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh.
20-9 These were the cities designated for all the people of Israel and <f>ⓚ</f>for the stranger sojourning among them, that anyone who killed a person without intent could flee there, so that he might not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, till he stood before the congregation.
94-1 <pb/><t>O LORD, God of <f>ⓐ</f>vengeance, </t><t>O God of vengeance, <f>ⓑ</f>shine forth!</t>
94-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Rise up, O <f>ⓓ</f>judge of the earth; </t><t>repay to the <f>ⓔ</f>proud what they deserve!</t>
94-3 <t>O LORD, <f>ⓕ</f>how long shall the wicked, </t><t>how long shall <f>ⓖ</f>the wicked exult?</t>
94-4 <t>They pour out their <f>ⓗ</f>arrogant words; </t><t>all <f>ⓘ</f>the evildoers boast.</t>
94-5 <t>They <f>ⓙ</f>crush your people, O LORD, </t><t>and afflict your heritage.</t>
94-6 <t>They kill <f>ⓚ</f>the widow and the sojourner, </t><t>and murder <f>ⓛ</f>the fatherless;</t>
94-7 <t><f>ⓜ</f> and they say, “The LORD does not see; </t><t>the God of Jacob does not perceive.” </t>
94-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> Understand, O dullest of the people! </t><t>Fools, when will you be wise?</t>
94-9 <t><f>ⓞ</f> He who planted the ear, does he not hear? </t><t>He who formed the eye, does he not see?</t>
94-10 <t>He who <f>ⓟ</f>disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? </t><t>He who <f>ⓠ</f>teaches man knowledge — </t>
94-11 <t><f>ⓡ</f> the LORD — knows the thoughts of man, </t><t>that they are <f>ⓢ</f>but a breath. <f>[1]</f> </t>
94-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> Blessed is the man whom you <f>ⓤ</f>discipline, O LORD, </t><t>and whom you teach out of your law,</t>
94-13 <t>to give him <f>ⓥ</f>rest from <f>ⓦ</f>days of trouble, </t><t>until <f>ⓧ</f>a pit is dug for the wicked.</t>
94-14 <t><f>ⓨ</f> For the LORD will not forsake his <f>ⓩ</f>people; </t><t>he will not abandon his <f>ⓐ</f>heritage;</t>
94-15 <t>for <f>ⓑ</f>justice will return to the righteous, </t><t>and all the upright in heart will <f>ⓒ</f>follow it. </t>
94-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> Who rises up for me against the wicked? </t><t>Who stands up for me against evildoers?</t>
94-17 <t><f>ⓔ</f> If the LORD had not been my help, </t><t>my soul would soon have lived in the land of <f>ⓕ</f>silence.</t>
94-18 <t>When I thought, <f>ⓖ</f>“My foot slips,” </t><t>your steadfast love, O LORD, <f>ⓗ</f>held me up.</t>
94-19 <t>When the cares of my heart are many, </t><t>your consolations cheer my soul.</t>
94-20 <t>Can <f>ⓘ</f>wicked rulers be allied with you, </t><t>those who frame <f>[2]</f> injustice by <f>ⓙ</f>statute?</t>
94-21 <t>They <f>ⓚ</f>band together against the life of the righteous </t><t>and condemn <f>ⓛ</f>the innocent to death. <f>[3]</f></t>
94-22 <t>But the LORD has become my <f>ⓜ</f>stronghold, </t><t>and my God <f>ⓝ</f>the rock of my <f>ⓞ</f>refuge.</t>
94-23 <t>He will bring back on them <f>ⓟ</f>their iniquity </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>wipe them out for their wickedness; </t><t>the LORD our God will wipe them out. </t>
8-1 <pb/>When he came down from the mountain, <f>ⓐ</f>great crowds followed him.
8-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And behold, a leper <f>[1]</f> came to him and <f>ⓒ</f>knelt before him, saying, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.”
8-3 And Jesus <f>[2]</f> stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, <J>“I will; be clean.”</J> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
8-4 And Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, <f>ⓔ</f>show yourself to the priest and <f>ⓕ</f>offer the gift that Moses commanded, <f>ⓖ</f>for a proof to them.”</J>
8-5 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him,
8-6 “Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly.”
8-7 And he said to him, <J>“I will come and heal him.”</J>
8-8 But the centurion replied, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but <f>ⓘ</f>only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
8-9 For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant, <f>[3]</f> ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
8-10 When Jesus heard this, <f>ⓙ</f>he marveled and said to those who followed him, <J>“Truly, I tell you, with <f>ⓚ</f>no one in Israel <f>[4]</f> have I found such faith.</J>
8-11 <J>I tell you, <f>ⓛ</f>many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,</J>
8-12 <J><f>ⓜ</f> while the sons of the kingdom <f>ⓝ</f>will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place <f>ⓞ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</J>
8-13 And to the centurion Jesus said, <J>“Go; let it be done for you <f>ⓟ</f>as you have believed.”</J> <f>ⓠ</f>And the servant was healed at that very moment.
8-14 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw <f>ⓢ</f>his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
8-15 He <f>ⓣ</f>touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him.
8-16 That evening they brought to him many who were <f>ⓤ</f>oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits <f>ⓥ</f>with a word and healed all who were sick.
8-17 <f>ⓦ</f> This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: <f>ⓧ</f>“He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.”
8-18 <pb/>Now <f>ⓨ</f>when Jesus saw a crowd around him, <f>ⓩ</f>he gave orders to go over to the other side.
8-19 <f>ⓐ</f> And a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
8-20 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</J>
8-21 Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”
8-22 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Follow me, and leave <f>ⓑ</f>the dead to bury their own dead.”</J>
8-23 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
8-24 And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but <f>ⓓ</f>he was asleep.
8-25 And they went and woke him, saying, <f>ⓔ</f>“Save us, Lord; we are perishing.”
8-26 And he said to them, <J>“Why are you <f>ⓕ</f>afraid, <f>ⓖ</f>O you of little faith?”</J> Then he rose and <f>ⓗ</f>rebuked the winds and the sea, and <f>ⓘ</f>there was a great calm.
8-27 And the men <f>ⓙ</f>marveled, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even <f>ⓚ</f>winds and sea obey him?”
8-28 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, <f>[5]</f> two <f>ⓜ</f>demon-possessed <f>[6]</f> men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way.
8-29 And behold, they <f>ⓝ</f>cried out, “What have you to do with us, <f>ⓞ</f>O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us <f>ⓟ</f>before the time?”
8-30 Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them.
8-31 And the demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs.”
8-32 And he said to them, <J>“Go.”</J> So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.
8-33 The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the <f>ⓠ</f>demon-possessed men.
8-34 And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, <f>ⓡ</f>they begged him to leave their region.
