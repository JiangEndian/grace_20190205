1-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses <f>ⓐ</f>in the wilderness of Sinai, <f>ⓑ</f>in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
1-2 <f>ⓒ</f> “Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, by clans, <f>ⓓ</f>by fathers' houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head.
1-3 <f>ⓔ</f> From twenty years old and upward, all in Israel who are able to go to war, you and Aaron shall list them, <f>ⓕ</f>company by company.
1-4 And there shall be with you a man from each tribe, each man being the head of the house of his fathers.
1-5 And these are the names of the men who shall assist you. From Reuben, <f>ⓖ</f>Elizur the son of Shedeur;

1-10 from the sons of Joseph, from Ephraim, <f>ⓛ</f>Elishama the son of Ammihud, and from Manasseh, <f>ⓜ</f>Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;
1-11 from Benjamin, <f>ⓝ</f>Abidan the son of Gideoni;
1-12 from Dan, <f>ⓞ</f>Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;
1-13 from Asher, <f>ⓟ</f>Pagiel the son of Ochran;
1-14 from Gad, Eliasaph the son of <f>ⓠ</f>Deuel;
1-15 from Naphtali, <f>ⓡ</f>Ahira the son of Enan.”
1-16 These were the ones <f>ⓢ</f>chosen from the congregation, <f>ⓣ</f>the chiefs of their ancestral tribes, the heads of the clans of Israel.
1-17 <pb/>Moses and Aaron took these men <f>ⓤ</f>who had been named,
1-18 and on the first day of the second month, they assembled the whole congregation together, who registered themselves by clans, by fathers' houses, according to the number of names from twenty years old and upward, head by head,
1-19 as the LORD commanded Moses. So he listed them in the wilderness of Sinai.
1-20 <pb/>The people of <f>ⓥ</f>Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war:

1-24 <pb/>Of the people of Gad, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war:

1-28 <pb/>Of the people of Issachar, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

1-31 those listed of the tribe of Zebulun were <f>ⓑ</f>57,400.
1-32 <pb/>Of the people of Joseph, namely, of the people of Ephraim, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:
1-33 those listed of the tribe of Ephraim were <f>ⓒ</f>40,500.
1-34 <pb/>Of the people of Manasseh, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

1-38 <pb/>Of the people of Dan, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:
1-39 those listed of the tribe of Dan were <f>ⓕ</f>62,700.
1-40 <pb/>Of the people of Asher, their generations, by their clans, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war:

1-44 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> These are those who were listed, whom Moses and Aaron listed with the help of the chiefs of Israel, twelve men, each representing his fathers' house.
1-45 So all those listed of the people of Israel, by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, every man able to go to war in Israel —
1-46 all those listed were <f>ⓙ</f>603,550.
1-47 <pb/>But <f>ⓚ</f>the Levites were not listed along with them by their ancestral tribe.
1-48 For the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1-49 “Only the tribe of Levi you shall not list, and you shall not take a census of them among the people of Israel.
1-50 <f>ⓛ</f> But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it <f>ⓜ</f>and shall camp around the tabernacle.
1-51 <f>ⓝ</f> When the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down, and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. <f>ⓞ</f>And if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death.
1-52 The people of Israel shall pitch their tents by their companies, each man in his own camp and <f>ⓟ</f>each man by his own standard.
1-53 But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there may be no <f>ⓠ</f>wrath on the congregation of the people of Israel. <f>ⓡ</f>And the Levites shall keep guard over the tabernacle of the testimony.”
1-54 Thus did the people of Israel; they did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.
5-1 <pb/><t>Give ear to my words, O LORD; </t><t>consider my <f>ⓐ</f>groaning.</t>
5-2 <t>Give attention to the sound of my cry, </t><t>my <f>ⓑ</f>King and my God, </t><t>for <f>ⓒ</f>to you do I pray.</t>
5-3 <t>O LORD, in <f>ⓓ</f>the morning you hear my voice; </t><t>in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓔ</f>watch. </t>
5-4 <pb/><t>For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; </t><t>evil may not dwell with you.</t>
5-5 <t>The <f>ⓕ</f>boastful shall not <f>ⓖ</f>stand before your eyes; </t><t>you <f>ⓗ</f>hate all evildoers.</t>
5-6 <t>You destroy those who speak <f>ⓘ</f>lies; </t><t>the LORD abhors <f>ⓙ</f>the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. </t>
5-7 <pb/><t>But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, </t><t>will enter your house. </t><t>I will <f>ⓚ</f>bow down <f>ⓛ</f>toward your <f>ⓜ</f>holy temple </t><t>in the fear of you.</t>
5-8 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness </t><t>because of my enemies; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>make your way straight before me. </t>
5-9 <pb/><t>For there is no truth in their mouth; </t><t>their inmost self is <f>ⓟ</f>destruction; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>their throat is <f>ⓡ</f>an open grave; </t><t>they <f>ⓢ</f>flatter with their tongue.</t>
5-10 <t><f>ⓣ</f> Make them bear their guilt, O God; </t><t>let them <f>ⓤ</f>fall by their own counsels; </t><t>because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, </t><t>for they have rebelled against you. </t>
5-11 <pb/><t>But let all who <f>ⓥ</f>take refuge in you <f>ⓦ</f>rejoice; </t><t>let them ever sing for joy, </t><t>and spread your protection over them, </t><t>that those who love your name may <f>ⓧ</f>exult in you.</t>
5-12 <t>For you <f>ⓨ</f>bless the righteous, O LORD; </t><t>you <f>ⓩ</f>cover him with favor as with <f>ⓐ</f>a shield. </t>
46-1 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓐ</f>The gate of <f>ⓑ</f>the inner court that faces east shall be shut on the six working days, but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and <f>ⓒ</f>on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
46-2 <f>ⓓ</f> The prince shall enter by the vestibule of the gate from outside, and shall take his stand by <f>ⓔ</f>the post of the gate. <f>ⓕ</f>The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at <f>ⓖ</f>the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.
46-3 <f>ⓗ</f> The people of the land shall bow down at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.
46-4 <f>ⓘ</f> The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD <f>ⓙ</f>on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish.
46-5 And <f>ⓚ</f>the grain offering with the ram shall be an ephah, <f>[1]</f> and the grain offering with the lambs shall be <f>ⓛ</f>as much as he is able, together with a hin <f>[2]</f> of oil to each ephah.
46-6 On the day of the new moon he shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish.
46-7 As a grain offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs <f>ⓜ</f>as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.
46-8 <f>ⓝ</f> When the prince enters, he shall enter by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.
46-9 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> “When the people of the land <f>ⓟ</f>come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate, and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but each shall go out straight ahead.
46-10 When they enter, <f>ⓠ</f>the prince shall enter with them, and when they go out, he shall go out.
46-11 <pb/>“At the feasts and the appointed festivals, <f>ⓡ</f>the grain offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs <f>ⓢ</f>as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah.
46-12 When the prince provides <f>ⓣ</f>a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, <f>ⓤ</f>the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall offer his burnt offering or his peace offerings <f>ⓥ</f>as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut.
46-13 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> “You shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning you shall provide it.
46-14 And <f>ⓧ</f>you shall provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, one sixth of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour, as a grain offering to the LORD. This is a perpetual statute.
46-15 Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, for <f>ⓨ</f>a regular burnt offering.
46-16 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons as his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons. It is their property by inheritance.
46-17 But if he makes a gift <f>ⓩ</f>out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to <f>ⓐ</f>the year of liberty. Then it shall revert to the prince; surely it is his inheritance — it shall belong to his sons.
46-18 <f>ⓑ</f> The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, <f>ⓒ</f>thrusting them out of their property. He shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be <f>ⓓ</f>scattered from his property.”
46-19 <pb/>Then he brought me through the entrance, which was <f>ⓔ</f>at the side of the gate, to the north row of <f>ⓕ</f>the holy chambers for the priests, and behold, a place was there at the extreme western end of them.
46-20 And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests <f>ⓖ</f>shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where <f>ⓗ</f>they shall bake the grain offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so <f>ⓘ</f>transmit holiness to the people.”
46-21 <pb/>Then he brought me out to the outer court and led me around to the four corners of the court. And behold, in each corner of the court there was another court —
46-22 in the four corners of the court were small <f>[3]</f> courts, forty cubits <f>[4]</f> long and thirty broad; the four were of the same size.
46-23 On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows all around.
46-24 Then he said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who <f>ⓙ</f>minister at the temple <f>ⓚ</f>shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”
