Ruth 3-1 <pb/>Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek <f>ⓐ</f>rest for you, that it may be well with you?
Ruth 3-2 Is not Boaz <f>ⓑ</f>our relative, <f>ⓒ</f>with whose young women you were? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.
Ruth 3-3 <f>ⓓ</f> Wash therefore and anoint yourself, and put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor, but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
Ruth 3-4 But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down, and he will tell you what to do.”
Ruth 3-5 And she replied, “All that you say I will do.”
Ruth 3-6 <pb/>So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her.
Ruth 3-7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and <f>ⓔ</f>his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
Ruth 3-8 At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet!
Ruth 3-9 He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your servant. <f>ⓕ</f>Spread your wings <f>[1]</f> over your servant, for you are <f>ⓖ</f>a redeemer.”
Ruth 3-10 And he said, <f>ⓗ</f>“May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than <f>ⓘ</f>the first in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.
Ruth 3-11 And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are <f>ⓙ</f>a worthy woman.
Ruth 3-12 And now it is true that I am <f>ⓚ</f>a redeemer. Yet there is a redeemer nearer than I.
Ruth 3-13 Remain tonight, and in the morning, if he will <f>ⓛ</f>redeem you, good; let him do it. But if he is not willing to redeem you, then, <f>ⓜ</f>as the LORD lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning.”
Ruth 3-14 <pb/>So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another. And he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”
Ruth 3-15 And he said, “Bring the garment you are wearing and hold it out.” So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley and put it on her. Then she went into the city.
Ruth 3-16 And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did you fare, my daughter?” Then she told her all that the man had done for her,
Ruth 3-17 saying, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said to me, ‘You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’”
Ruth 3-18 She replied, “Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest but will settle the matter today.”

Mark 8-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them,
Mark 8-2 <J><f>ⓑ</f> “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat.</J>
Mark 8-3 <J>And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come from far away.”</J>
Mark 8-4 And his disciples answered him, “How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place?”
Mark 8-5 And he asked them, <J>“How many loaves do you have?”</J> They said, <f>ⓒ</f>“Seven.”
Mark 8-6 And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and <f>ⓓ</f>having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.
Mark 8-7 And they had a few small fish. And <f>ⓔ</f>having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them.
Mark 8-8 And <f>ⓕ</f>they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, <f>ⓖ</f>seven baskets full.
Mark 8-9 And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away.
Mark 8-10 And immediately he got into <f>ⓗ</f>the boat with his disciples and went to the district of <f>ⓘ</f>Dalmanutha. <f>[1]</f>
Mark 8-11 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, <f>ⓚ</f>seeking from him <f>ⓛ</f>a sign from heaven <f>ⓜ</f>to test him.
Mark 8-12 And <f>ⓝ</f>he sighed deeply <f>ⓞ</f>in his spirit and said, <J>“Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</J>
Mark 8-13 And <f>ⓟ</f>he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.
Mark 8-14 <pb/>Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
Mark 8-15 And he cautioned them, saying, <J>“Watch out; <f>ⓠ</f>beware of <f>ⓡ</f>the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of <f>ⓢ</f>Herod.” <f>[2]</f></J>
Mark 8-16 And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.
Mark 8-17 And <f>ⓣ</f>Jesus, aware of this, said to them, <J>“Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? <f>ⓤ</f>Do you not yet perceive <f>ⓥ</f>or understand? <f>ⓦ</f>Are your hearts hardened?</J>
Mark 8-18 <J><f>ⓧ</f> Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?</J>
Mark 8-19 <J>When I broke <f>ⓨ</f>the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?”</J> They said to him, “Twelve.”
Mark 8-20 <J>“And <f>ⓩ</f>the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?”</J> And they said to him, “Seven.”
Mark 8-21 And he said to them, <J>“Do you not yet understand?”</J>
Mark 8-22 <pb/>And they came <f>ⓐ</f>to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him.
Mark 8-23 And <f>ⓑ</f>he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when <f>ⓒ</f>he had <f>ⓓ</f>spit on his eyes and <f>ⓔ</f>laid his hands on him, he asked him, <J>“Do you see anything?”</J>
Mark 8-24 And he looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees, walking.”
Mark 8-25 Then Jesus <f>[3]</f> laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
Mark 8-26 And he sent him to his home, saying, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Do not even enter the village.”</J>
Mark 8-27 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, <J>“Who do people say that I am?”</J>
Mark 8-28 And they told him, <f>ⓗ</f>“John the Baptist; and others say, <f>ⓘ</f>Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”
Mark 8-29 And he asked them, <J>“But who do you say that I am?”</J> Peter answered him, <f>ⓙ</f>“You are <f>ⓚ</f>the Christ.”
Mark 8-30 <f>ⓛ</f> And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.
Mark 8-31 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> And he began to teach them that <f>ⓝ</f>the Son of Man must <f>ⓞ</f>suffer many things and <f>ⓟ</f>be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and <f>ⓠ</f>after three days rise again.
Mark 8-32 And he said this <f>ⓡ</f>plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
Mark 8-33 But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“Get behind me, Satan! For you <f>ⓣ</f>are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”</J>
Mark 8-34 <pb/>And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, <J>“If anyone would come after me, let him <f>ⓤ</f>deny himself and <f>ⓥ</f>take up his cross and follow me.</J>
Mark 8-35 <J>For <f>ⓦ</f>whoever would save his life <f>[4]</f> will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake <f>ⓧ</f>and the gospel's will save it.</J>
Mark 8-36 <J><f>ⓨ</f> For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?</J>
Mark 8-37 <J>For <f>ⓩ</f>what can a man give in return for his soul?</J>
Mark 8-38 <J>For <f>ⓐ</f>whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this <f>ⓑ</f>adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed <f>ⓒ</f>when he comes in the glory of his Father with <f>ⓓ</f>the holy angels.”</J>
