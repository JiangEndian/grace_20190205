1 Samuel 20-1 <pb/>Then David fled from Naioth <f>ⓐ</f>in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”
1 Samuel 20-2 And he said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. And why should my father hide this from me? It is not so.”
1 Samuel 20-3 But David vowed again, saying, “Your father knows well that <f>ⓑ</f>I have found favor in your eyes, and he thinks, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But truly, <f>ⓒ</f>as the LORD lives and <f>ⓓ</f>as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.”
1 Samuel 20-4 Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”
1 Samuel 20-5 David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is <f>ⓔ</f>the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go, <f>ⓕ</f>that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening.
1 Samuel 20-6 <f>ⓖ</f> If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me to run <f>ⓗ</f>to Bethlehem his city, for there is a yearly <f>ⓘ</f>sacrifice there for all the clan.’
1 Samuel 20-7 If he says, ‘Good!’ it will be well with your servant, but if he is angry, then know that <f>ⓙ</f>harm is determined by him.
1 Samuel 20-8 Therefore deal kindly with your servant, <f>ⓚ</f>for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. <f>ⓛ</f>But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”
1 Samuel 20-9 And Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! If I knew that <f>ⓜ</f>it was determined by my father that harm should come to you, would I not tell you?”
1 Samuel 20-10 Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?”
1 Samuel 20-11 And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So they both went out into the field.
1 Samuel 20-12 <pb/>And Jonathan said to David, “The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! <f>[1]</f> When I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?
1 Samuel 20-13 But should it please my father to do you harm, <f>ⓝ</f>the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. <f>ⓞ</f>May the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.
1 Samuel 20-14 If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the LORD, that I may not die;
1 Samuel 20-15 <f>ⓟ</f> and do not cut off <f>[2]</f> your steadfast love from my house forever, when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”
1 Samuel 20-16 And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, <f>ⓠ</f>“May <f>[3]</f> the LORD take vengeance on David's enemies.”
1 Samuel 20-17 And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, <f>ⓡ</f>for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
1 Samuel 20-18 <pb/>Then Jonathan said to him, <f>ⓢ</f>“Tomorrow is the new moon, and <f>ⓣ</f>you will be missed, because <f>ⓤ</f>your seat will be empty.
1 Samuel 20-19 On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain beside the stone heap. <f>[4]</f>
1 Samuel 20-20 And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.
1 Samuel 20-21 And behold, I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,’ then you are to come, for, <f>ⓥ</f>as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.
1 Samuel 20-22 But if I say to the youth, <f>ⓦ</f>‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go, for the LORD has sent you away.
1 Samuel 20-23 <f>ⓧ</f> And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, <f>ⓨ</f>the LORD is between you and me forever.”
1 Samuel 20-24 <pb/>So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.
1 Samuel 20-25 The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite, <f>[5]</f> and Abner sat by Saul's side, <f>ⓩ</f>but David's place was empty.
1 Samuel 20-26 <pb/>Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him. <f>ⓐ</f>He is not clean; surely he is not clean.”
1 Samuel 20-27 But on <f>ⓑ</f>the second day, the day after the new moon, <f>ⓒ</f>David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”
1 Samuel 20-28 Jonathan answered Saul, <f>ⓓ</f>“David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.
1 Samuel 20-29 He said, ‘Let me go, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away and see my brothers.’ For this reason he has not come to the king's table.”
1 Samuel 20-30 <pb/>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
1 Samuel 20-31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.”
1 Samuel 20-32 Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, <f>ⓔ</f>“Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”
1 Samuel 20-33 <f>ⓕ</f> But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew <f>ⓖ</f>that his father was determined to put David to death.
1 Samuel 20-34 And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.
1 Samuel 20-35 <pb/>In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him a little boy.
1 Samuel 20-36 And he said to his boy, “Run and find the arrows that I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
1 Samuel 20-37 And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Is not the arrow beyond you?”
1 Samuel 20-38 And Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry! Be quick! Do not stay!” So Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master.
1 Samuel 20-39 But the boy knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
1 Samuel 20-40 And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go and carry them to the city.”
1 Samuel 20-41 And as soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap <f>[6]</f> and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed one another and wept with one another, David weeping the most.
1 Samuel 20-42 Then Jonathan said to David, <f>ⓘ</f>“Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>‘The LORD shall be between me and you, <f>ⓚ</f>and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.’” And he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city. <f>[7]</f>

Luke 13-1 <pb/>There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood <f>ⓐ</f>Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
Luke 13-2 And he answered them, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way?</J>
Luke 13-3 <J>No, I tell you; but unless you <f>ⓒ</f>repent, you will all likewise perish.</J>
Luke 13-4 <J>Or those eighteen on whom the tower in <f>ⓓ</f>Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem?</J>
Luke 13-5 <J>No, I tell you; but unless you <f>ⓔ</f>repent, you will all likewise perish.”</J>
Luke 13-6 <pb/>And he told this parable: <J>“A man had <f>ⓕ</f>a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.</J>
Luke 13-7 <J>And he said to the vinedresser, ‘Look, for three years now I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. <f>ⓖ</f>Cut it down. Why should it use up the ground?’</J>
Luke 13-8 <J>And he answered him, ‘Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure.</J>
Luke 13-9 <J>Then if it should bear fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.’”</J>
Luke 13-10 <pb/>Now <f>ⓗ</f>he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
Luke 13-11 And behold, there was a woman who had had <f>ⓘ</f>a disabling spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself.
Luke 13-12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, <J>“Woman, you are freed from your disability.”</J>
Luke 13-13 And he <f>ⓙ</f>laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she <f>ⓚ</f>glorified God.
Luke 13-14 But <f>ⓛ</f>the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus <f>ⓜ</f>had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, <f>ⓝ</f>“There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.”
Luke 13-15 Then the Lord answered him, <J>“You hypocrites! <f>ⓞ</f>Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?</J>
Luke 13-16 <J>And ought not this woman, <f>ⓟ</f>a daughter of Abraham whom <f>ⓠ</f>Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?”</J>
Luke 13-17 As he said these things, <f>ⓡ</f>all his adversaries were put to shame, and <f>ⓢ</f>all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.
Luke 13-18 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> He said therefore, <J>“What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?</J>
Luke 13-19 <J>It is like <f>ⓤ</f>a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air made nests in its branches.”</J>
Luke 13-20 <pb/>And again he said, <J>“To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</J>
Luke 13-21 <J><f>ⓥ</f> It is like leaven that a woman took and hid in <f>ⓦ</f>three measures of flour, until it was <f>ⓧ</f>all leavened.”</J>
Luke 13-22 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and <f>ⓩ</f>journeying toward Jerusalem.
Luke 13-23 And someone said to him, “Lord, <f>ⓐ</f>will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them,
Luke 13-24 <J><f>ⓑ</f> “Strive <f>ⓒ</f>to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.</J>
Luke 13-25 <J><f>ⓓ</f> When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Lord, open to us,’ then he will answer you, <f>ⓕ</f>‘I do not know where you come from.’</J>
Luke 13-26 <J>Then you will begin to say, <f>ⓖ</f>‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’</J>
Luke 13-27 <J>But he will say, ‘I tell you, <f>ⓗ</f>I do not know where you come from. <f>ⓘ</f>Depart from me, all you workers of evil!’</J>
Luke 13-28 <J><f>ⓙ</f> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see <f>ⓚ</f>Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but <f>ⓛ</f>you yourselves cast out.</J>
Luke 13-29 <J>And <f>ⓜ</f>people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and <f>ⓝ</f>recline at table in the kingdom of God.</J>
Luke 13-30 <J>And behold, <f>ⓞ</f>some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”</J>
Luke 13-31 <pb/>At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, “Get away from <f>ⓟ</f>here, for <f>ⓠ</f>Herod wants to kill you.”
Luke 13-32 And he said to them, <J>“Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day <f>ⓡ</f>I finish my course.</J>
Luke 13-33 <J>Nevertheless, <f>ⓢ</f>I <f>ⓣ</f>must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that <f>ⓤ</f>a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.’</J>
Luke 13-34 <J><f>ⓥ</f> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that <f>ⓦ</f>kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! <f>ⓧ</f>How often would I have <f>ⓨ</f>gathered <f>ⓩ</f>your children together <f>ⓐ</f>as a hen gathers her brood <f>ⓑ</f>under her wings, and <f>ⓒ</f>you were not willing!</J>
Luke 13-35 <J>Behold, <f>ⓓ</f>your house is forsaken. And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’”</J>
