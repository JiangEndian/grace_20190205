20-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together. <f>ⓑ</f>Thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and closed in on <f>ⓒ</f>Samaria and fought against it.
20-2 And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, “Thus says Ben-hadad:
20-3 ‘Your silver and your gold are mine; your best wives and children also are mine.’”
20-4 And the king of Israel answered, “As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have.”
20-5 The messengers came again and said, “Thus says Ben-hadad: ‘I sent to you, saying, “Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children.”
20-6 Nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants and lay hands on whatever pleases you and take it away.’”
20-7 <pb/>Then the king of Israel called all the <f>ⓓ</f>elders of the land and said, <f>ⓔ</f>“Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him.”
20-8 And all the elders and all the people said to him, “Do not listen or consent.”
20-9 So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’” And the messengers departed and brought him word again.
20-10 Ben-hadad sent to him and said, <f>ⓕ</f>“The gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people <f>ⓖ</f>who follow me.”
20-11 And the king of Israel answered, “Tell him, ‘Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off.’”
20-12 When Ben-hadad heard this message as <f>ⓗ</f>he was drinking with the kings in the booths, he said to his men, “Take your positions.” And they took their positions against the city.
20-13 <pb/>And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said, “Thus says the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I will give it into your hand this day, <f>ⓙ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.”
20-14 And Ahab said, “By whom?” He said, “Thus says the LORD, By the servants of the governors of the districts.” Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?” He answered, “You.”
20-15 Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts, and they were 232. And after them he mustered all the people of Israel, seven thousand.
20-16 <pb/>And they went out at noon, while Ben-hadad <f>ⓚ</f>was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him.
20-17 The servants of the governors of the districts went out first. And Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, “Men are coming out from Samaria.”
20-18 He said, “If they have come out for peace, take them alive. Or if they have come out for war, take them alive.”
20-19 <pb/>So these went out of the city, the servants of the governors of the districts and the army that followed them.
20-20 And each struck down his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them, but Ben-hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.
20-21 And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and struck the Syrians with a great blow.
20-22 <pb/>Then <f>ⓛ</f>the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, “Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do, for <f>ⓜ</f>in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you.”
20-23 <pb/>And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills, and so they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
20-24 And do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders in their places,
20-25 and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.” And he listened to their voice and did so.
20-26 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> In the spring, Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to <f>ⓞ</f>Aphek to fight against Israel.
20-27 And the people of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went against them. The people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the country.
20-28 And a <f>ⓟ</f>man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because the Syrians have said, <f>ⓠ</f>“The LORD is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys,” therefore <f>ⓡ</f>I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.’”
20-29 And they encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle was joined. And the people of Israel struck down of the Syrians 100,000 foot soldiers in one day.
20-30 And the rest fled into the city of <f>ⓢ</f>Aphek, and the wall fell upon 27,000 men who were left. <pb/>Ben-hadad also fled and entered <f>ⓣ</f>an inner chamber in the city.
20-31 And his servants said to him, “Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us <f>ⓤ</f>put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.”
20-32 So they <f>ⓥ</f>tied sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please, let me live.’” And he said, “Does he still live? He is my brother.”
20-33 Now the men were watching for a sign, and they quickly took it up from him and said, “Yes, your brother Ben-hadad.” Then he said, “Go and bring him.” Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
20-34 And Ben-hadad said to him, <f>ⓦ</f>“The cities that my father took from your father I will restore, and you may establish bazaars for yourself in <f>ⓧ</f>Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” And Ahab said, “I will let you go on these terms.” So he made a covenant with him and let him go.
20-35 <pb/>And a certain man of <f>ⓨ</f>the sons of the prophets said to his fellow <f>ⓩ</f>at the command of the LORD, “Strike me, please.” But the man refused to strike him.
20-36 Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall strike you down.” And as soon as he had departed from him, <f>ⓐ</f>a lion met him and struck him down.
20-37 Then he found another man and said, “Strike me, please.” And the man struck him — struck him and wounded him.
20-38 So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, <f>ⓑ</f>disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
20-39 And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, <f>ⓒ</f>your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent <f>[1]</f> of silver.’
20-40 And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” The king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.”
20-41 Then he hurried to take the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
20-42 And he said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, <f>[2]</f> therefore <f>ⓓ</f>your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people.’”
20-43 And the king of Israel <f>ⓔ</f>went to his house vexed and sullen and came to Samaria.
5-1 <pb/><t>I <f>ⓐ</f>came to my garden, my <f>ⓑ</f>sister, my bride, </t><t>I gathered my <f>ⓒ</f>myrrh with my spice, </t><t>I ate my <f>ⓓ</f>honeycomb with my honey, </t><t>I <f>ⓔ</f>drank my wine with my milk. <pb/><e>Others</e> </pb> </t> <pb/><t>Eat, <f>ⓕ</f>friends, drink, </t><t>and be drunk with love! </t>
5-2 <pb/><t>I slept, but my heart was awake. </t><t>A sound! My beloved is <f>ⓖ</f>knocking. </t><t>“Open to me, my <f>ⓗ</f>sister, my <f>ⓘ</f>love, </t><t>my <f>ⓙ</f>dove, my <f>ⓚ</f>perfect one, </t><t>for my head is wet with dew, </t><t>my <f>ⓛ</f>locks with the drops of the night.”</t>
5-3 <t><f>ⓜ</f> I had put off my garment; </t><t>how could I put it on? </t><t>I had <f>ⓝ</f>bathed my feet; </t><t>how could I soil them?</t>
5-4 <t>My beloved put his hand to the latch, </t><t>and my heart was thrilled within me.</t>
5-5 <t>I arose to open to my beloved, </t><t>and my hands dripped with myrrh, </t><t>my fingers with <f>ⓞ</f>liquid myrrh, </t><t>on the handles of the bolt.</t>
5-6 <t>I opened to my beloved, </t><t>but my beloved had turned and gone. </t><t>My soul failed me when he <f>ⓟ</f>spoke. </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>I sought him, but found him not; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>I called him, but he gave no answer.</t>
5-7 <t><f>ⓢ</f> The watchmen found me </t><t>as they went about in the city; </t><t>they beat me, they bruised me, </t><t>they took away my veil, </t><t>those watchmen of the walls.</t>
5-8 <t>I <f>ⓣ</f>adjure you, O <f>ⓤ</f>daughters of Jerusalem, </t><t>if you find my beloved, </t><t>that you tell him </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>I am sick with love. </t>
5-9 <pb/><t>What is your beloved more than another beloved, </t><t>O <f>ⓦ</f>most beautiful among women? </t><t>What is your beloved more than another beloved, </t><t>that you thus <f>ⓧ</f>adjure us? </t>
5-10 <pb/><t>My beloved is radiant and <f>ⓨ</f>ruddy, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>distinguished among ten thousand.</t>
5-11 <t>His head is the finest gold; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>his locks are wavy, </t><t>black as a raven.</t>
5-12 <t>His <f>ⓑ</f>eyes are like doves </t><t>beside streams of water, </t><t>bathed in milk, </t><t>sitting beside a full pool. <f>[1]</f></t>
5-13 <t>His <f>ⓒ</f>cheeks are like <f>ⓓ</f>beds of spices, </t><t>mounds of sweet-smelling herbs. </t><t>His lips are <f>ⓔ</f>lilies, </t><t>dripping <f>ⓕ</f>liquid myrrh.</t>
5-14 <t>His arms are rods of gold, </t><t>set with <f>ⓖ</f>jewels. </t><t>His body is polished ivory, <f>[2]</f> </t><t>bedecked with <f>ⓗ</f>sapphires. <f>[3]</f></t>
5-15 <t>His legs are alabaster columns, </t><t>set on bases of gold. </t><t>His appearance is like <f>ⓘ</f>Lebanon, </t><t>choice as the cedars.</t>
5-16 <t>His <f>ⓙ</f>mouth <f>[4]</f> is most sweet, </t><t>and he is altogether desirable. </t><t>This is my beloved and this is my friend, </t><t>O <f>ⓚ</f>daughters of Jerusalem. </t>
23-1 <pb/>And looking intently at the council, Paul said, “Brothers, <f>ⓐ</f>I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.”
23-2 And the high priest <f>ⓑ</f>Ananias commanded those who stood by him <f>ⓒ</f>to strike him on the mouth.
23-3 Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you <f>ⓓ</f>whitewashed <f>ⓔ</f>wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet <f>ⓕ</f>contrary to the law you <f>ⓖ</f>order me to be struck?”
23-4 Those who stood by said, “Would you revile <f>ⓗ</f>God's high priest?”
23-5 And Paul said, <f>ⓘ</f>“I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, <f>ⓙ</f>‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’”
23-6 <pb/>Now when Paul perceived that one part were <f>ⓚ</f>Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Brothers, <f>ⓛ</f>I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is <f>ⓜ</f>with respect to the <f>ⓝ</f>hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.”
23-7 And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
23-8 For the Sadducees <f>ⓞ</f>say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
23-9 Then a great clamor arose, and some of <f>ⓟ</f>the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, <f>ⓠ</f>“We find nothing wrong in this man. What <f>ⓡ</f>if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?”
23-10 And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into <f>ⓢ</f>the barracks.
23-11 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> The following night <f>ⓤ</f>the Lord stood by him and said, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“Take courage, for <f>ⓦ</f>as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must <f>ⓧ</f>testify also in Rome.”</J>
23-12 <pb/>When it was day, <f>ⓨ</f>the Jews made a plot and <f>ⓩ</f>bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
23-13 There were more than forty who made this conspiracy.
23-14 They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul.
23-15 Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.”
23-16 <pb/>Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered <f>ⓐ</f>the barracks and told Paul.
23-17 Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him.”
23-18 So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, “Paul <f>ⓑ</f>the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.”
23-19 The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, “What is it that you have to tell me?”
23-20 And he said, <f>ⓒ</f>“The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him.
23-21 But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who <f>ⓓ</f>have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent.”
23-22 So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, “Tell no one that you have informed me of these things.”
23-23 <pb/>Then he called two of the centurions and said, “Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night. <f>[1]</f>
23-24 Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to <f>ⓔ</f>Felix <f>ⓕ</f>the governor.”
23-25 And he wrote a letter to this effect:
23-26 <pb/>“Claudius Lysias, to <f>ⓖ</f>his Excellency the governor Felix, <f>ⓗ</f>greetings.
23-27 <f>ⓘ</f> This man was seized by the Jews and <f>ⓙ</f>was about to be killed by them <f>ⓚ</f>when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, <f>ⓛ</f>having learned that he was a Roman citizen.
23-28 And <f>ⓜ</f>desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council.
23-29 I found that he was being accused <f>ⓝ</f>about questions of their law, but <f>ⓞ</f>charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.
23-30 <f>ⓟ</f> And when it was disclosed to me <f>ⓠ</f>that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, <f>ⓡ</f>ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.”
23-31 <pb/>So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
23-32 And on the next day they returned to <f>ⓢ</f>the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him.
23-33 When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.
23-34 On reading the letter, he asked what <f>ⓣ</f>province he was from. And when he learned <f>ⓤ</f>that he was from Cilicia,
23-35 he said, “I will give you a hearing <f>ⓥ</f>when your accusers arrive.” And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's <f>ⓦ</f>praetorium.
