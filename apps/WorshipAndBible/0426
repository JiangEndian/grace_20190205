Exodus 11-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses, “Yet <f>ⓐ</f>one plague more I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. <f>ⓑ</f>When he lets you go, he will drive you away completely.
Exodus 11-2 Speak now in the hearing of the people, that <f>ⓒ</f>they ask, every man of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor, for silver and gold jewelry.”
Exodus 11-3 <f>ⓓ</f> And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.
Exodus 11-4 <pb/>So Moses said, “Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓔ</f>‘About midnight I will go out in the midst of Egypt,
Exodus 11-5 and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is <f>ⓕ</f>behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the cattle.
Exodus 11-6 <f>ⓖ</f> There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever will be again.
Exodus 11-7 But not a dog shall growl <f>ⓗ</f>against any of the people of Israel, either man or beast, that you may know that the LORD <f>ⓘ</f>makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.’
Exodus 11-8 And <f>ⓙ</f>all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the people who follow you.’ And after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
Exodus 11-9 Then the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓚ</f>“Pharaoh will not listen to you, that <f>ⓛ</f>my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”
Exodus 11-10 <pb/>Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and the LORD <f>ⓜ</f>hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go out of his land.
Nehemiah 13-1 <pb/>On that day <f>ⓐ</f>they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people. And in it was found written <f>ⓑ</f>that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God,
Nehemiah 13-2 for they did not meet the people of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them — yet our God turned the curse into a blessing.
Nehemiah 13-3 As soon as the people heard the law, <f>ⓒ</f>they separated from Israel all <f>ⓓ</f>those of foreign descent.
Nehemiah 13-4 <pb/>Now before this, <f>ⓔ</f>Eliashib the priest, who <f>ⓕ</f>was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, and who was related to <f>ⓖ</f>Tobiah,
Nehemiah 13-5 prepared for Tobiah a large chamber where they had previously put the grain offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil, <f>ⓗ</f>which were given by commandment to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.
Nehemiah 13-6 While this was taking place, I was not in Jerusalem, for <f>ⓘ</f>in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes <f>ⓙ</f>king of Babylon I went to the king. And after some time I asked leave of the king
Nehemiah 13-7 and came to Jerusalem, and I then discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, <f>ⓚ</f>preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
Nehemiah 13-8 And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of Tobiah out of the chamber.
Nehemiah 13-9 Then I gave orders, and they <f>ⓛ</f>cleansed the chambers, and I brought back there the vessels of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.
Nehemiah 13-10 <pb/>I also found out that <f>ⓜ</f>the portions of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each <f>ⓝ</f>to his field.
Nehemiah 13-11 <f>ⓞ</f> So I confronted the officials and said, <f>ⓟ</f>“Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their stations.
Nehemiah 13-12 Then all Judah brought <f>ⓠ</f>the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses.
Nehemiah 13-13 And <f>ⓡ</f>I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, <f>ⓢ</f>for they were considered reliable, and their duty was to distribute to their brothers.
Nehemiah 13-14 <f>ⓣ</f> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.
Nehemiah 13-15 <pb/>In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses <f>ⓤ</f>on the Sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, <f>ⓥ</f>which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And <f>ⓦ</f>I warned them on the day when they sold food.
Nehemiah 13-16 Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah, in Jerusalem itself!
Nehemiah 13-17 <f>ⓧ</f> Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, <f>ⓨ</f>profaning the Sabbath day?
Nehemiah 13-18 <f>ⓩ</f> Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster <f>[1]</f> on us and on this city? Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”
Nehemiah 13-19 <pb/>As soon as it <f>ⓐ</f>began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I stationed some of my servants at the gates, that no load might be brought in on the Sabbath day.
Nehemiah 13-20 Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah 13-21 <f>ⓑ</f> But I warned them and said to them, “Why do you lodge outside the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.
Nehemiah 13-22 Then I commanded the Levites <f>ⓒ</f>that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the Sabbath day holy. <f>ⓓ</f>Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love.
Nehemiah 13-23 <pb/>In those days also I saw the Jews <f>ⓔ</f>who had married women <f>ⓕ</f>of Ashdod, <f>ⓖ</f>Ammon, and <f>ⓗ</f>Moab.
Nehemiah 13-24 And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people.
Nehemiah 13-25 <f>ⓘ</f> And I confronted them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair. <f>ⓙ</f>And I made them take an oath in the name of God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
Nehemiah 13-26 <f>ⓚ</f> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? <f>ⓛ</f>Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was <f>ⓜ</f>beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, foreign women made even him to sin.
Nehemiah 13-27 Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and <f>ⓝ</f>act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?”
Nehemiah 13-28 <pb/>And one of the sons of <f>ⓞ</f>Jehoiada, the son of <f>ⓟ</f>Eliashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of <f>ⓠ</f>Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I chased him from me.
Nehemiah 13-29 <f>ⓡ</f> Remember them, O my God, because they have desecrated the priesthood <f>ⓢ</f>and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
Nehemiah 13-30 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work;
Nehemiah 13-31 and I provided <f>ⓤ</f>for the wood offering <f>ⓥ</f>at appointed times, and for the firstfruits. <pb/><f>ⓦ</f>Remember me, O my God, for good.
Jeremiah 46-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet <f>ⓐ</f>concerning the nations.
Jeremiah 46-2 <pb/>About Egypt. <f>ⓑ</f>Concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish and which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in <f>ⓒ</f>the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:

Jeremiah 46-6 <pb/><t>“The swift cannot flee away, </t><t>nor the warrior escape; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>in the north by the river Euphrates </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>they have stumbled and fallen. </t>
Jeremiah 46-7 <pb/><t>“Who is this, <f>ⓛ</f>rising like the Nile, </t><t>like rivers <f>ⓜ</f>whose waters surge?</t>
Jeremiah 46-8 <t>Egypt rises like the Nile, </t><t>like rivers <f>ⓝ</f>whose waters surge. </t><t>He said, ‘I will rise, I will cover the earth, </t><t>I will destroy cities and their inhabitants.’</t>
Jeremiah 46-9 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Advance, O horses, </t><t>and rage, O chariots! </t><t>Let the warriors go out: </t><t>men of Cush and <f>ⓟ</f>Put who handle the shield, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>men of Lud, skilled in handling the bow.</t>
Jeremiah 46-10 <t><f>ⓡ</f> That day is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>a day of vengeance, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>to avenge himself on his foes. </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>The sword shall devour and be sated </t><t>and drink its fill of their blood. </t><t>For the Lord GOD of hosts holds <f>ⓥ</f>a sacrifice </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>in the north country <f>ⓧ</f>by the river Euphrates.</t>
Jeremiah 46-11 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Go up to Gilead, and take <f>ⓩ</f>balm, </t><t>O virgin daughter of Egypt! </t><t>In vain you have used many medicines; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>there is no healing for you.</t>
Jeremiah 46-12 <t>The nations have heard of your shame, </t><t>and the earth is full of your cry; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>for warrior has stumbled against warrior; </t><t>they have both fallen together.” </t>
Jeremiah 46-13 <pb/>The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of <f>ⓒ</f>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt:
Jeremiah 46-14 <pb/><t>“Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in <f>ⓓ</f>Migdol; </t><t>proclaim in <f>ⓔ</f>Memphis and <f>ⓕ</f>Tahpanhes; </t><t>say, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Stand ready and be prepared, </t><t>for <f>ⓗ</f>the sword shall devour around you.’</t>
Jeremiah 46-15 <t>Why are your mighty ones face down? </t><t>They do not stand <f>[1]</f> </t><t>because the LORD thrust them down.</t>
Jeremiah 46-16 <t>He made many stumble, <f>ⓘ</f>and they fell, </t><t>and they said one to another, </t><t>‘Arise, and let us go back to our own people </t><t>and to the land of our birth, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>because of the sword of the oppressor.’</t>
Jeremiah 46-17 <t>Call the name of <f>ⓚ</f>Pharaoh, king of Egypt, </t><t>‘Noisy one who lets the hour go by.’ </t>
Jeremiah 46-18 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> “As I live, declares the King, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>whose name is the LORD of hosts, </t><t>like <f>ⓝ</f>Tabor among the mountains </t><t>and like <f>ⓞ</f>Carmel by the sea, shall one come.</t>
Jeremiah 46-19 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Prepare yourselves baggage for exile, </t><t>O <f>ⓠ</f>inhabitants of Egypt! </t><t>For <f>ⓡ</f>Memphis shall become a waste, </t><t>a ruin, <f>ⓢ</f>without inhabitant. </t>
Jeremiah 46-20 <pb/><t>“A beautiful <f>ⓣ</f>heifer is Egypt, </t><t>but a biting fly <f>ⓤ</f>from the north has come upon her.</t>
Jeremiah 46-21 <t>Even her hired soldiers in her midst </t><t>are like <f>ⓥ</f>fattened calves; </t><t>yes, they have turned and fled together; </t><t>they did not stand, </t><t>for the day of their calamity has come upon them, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>the time of their punishment. </t>
Jeremiah 46-22 <pb/><t>“She makes <f>ⓧ</f>a sound like a serpent gliding away; </t><t>for her enemies march in force </t><t>and come against her with axes </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>like those who fell trees.</t>
Jeremiah 46-23 <t><f>ⓩ</f> They shall cut down her forest, <pb/>declares the LORD, </t><t>though it is impenetrable, </t><t>because <f>ⓐ</f>they are more numerous than locusts; </t><t>they are without number.</t>

Jeremiah 46-25 <pb/>The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said: “Behold, I am bringing punishment upon <f>ⓒ</f>Amon of <f>ⓓ</f>Thebes, and Pharaoh and Egypt <f>ⓔ</f>and her gods and her kings, upon Pharaoh and those who trust in him.
Jeremiah 46-26 <f>ⓕ</f> I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their life, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. <f>ⓖ</f>Afterward Egypt shall be inhabited <f>ⓗ</f>as in the days of old, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 46-27 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> “But fear not, O Jacob my servant, </t><t>nor be dismayed, O Israel, </t><t>for behold, I will save you from far away, </t><t>and your offspring from the land of their captivity. </t><t>Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, </t><t>and none shall make him afraid.</t>

2 Peter 1-1 <pb/>Simeon <f>[1]</f> Peter, a servant <f>[2]</f> and apostle of Jesus Christ, <pb/>To those who have obtained <f>ⓐ</f>a faith of equal standing with ours <f>ⓑ</f>by the righteousness of our <f>ⓒ</f>God and Savior Jesus Christ:
2 Peter 1-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> May grace and peace be multiplied to you <f>ⓔ</f>in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
2 Peter 1-3 <pb/>His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him <f>ⓕ</f>who called us to <f>[3]</f> his own glory and excellence, <f>[4]</f>
2 Peter 1-4 by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become <f>ⓖ</f>partakers of the divine nature, <f>ⓗ</f>having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
2 Peter 1-5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith <f>ⓘ</f>with virtue, <f>[5]</f> and virtue <f>ⓙ</f>with knowledge,
2 Peter 1-6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control <f>ⓚ</f>with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness,
2 Peter 1-7 and godliness <f>ⓛ</f>with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection <f>ⓜ</f>with love.
2 Peter 1-8 For if these qualities <f>[6]</f> are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or <f>ⓝ</f>unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Peter 1-9 For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he <f>ⓞ</f>is blind, having forgotten that he was <f>ⓟ</f>cleansed from his former sins.
2 Peter 1-10 Therefore, brothers, <f>[7]</f> be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and <f>ⓠ</f>election, for if you practice these qualities <f>ⓡ</f>you will never fall.
2 Peter 1-11 For in this way there will be richly provided for you <f>ⓢ</f>an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2 Peter 1-12 <pb/>Therefore I intend <f>ⓣ</f>always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in <f>ⓤ</f>the truth that you have.
2 Peter 1-13 I think it right, as long as I am in this <f>ⓥ</f>body, <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓦ</f>to stir you up by way of reminder,
2 Peter 1-14 <f>ⓧ</f> since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, <f>ⓨ</f>as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
2 Peter 1-15 And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.
2 Peter 1-16 <pb/>For we did not follow <f>ⓩ</f>cleverly devised <f>ⓐ</f>myths when we made known to you <f>ⓑ</f>the power and <f>ⓒ</f>coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but <f>ⓓ</f>we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
2 Peter 1-17 For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, <f>ⓔ</f>“This is my beloved Son, <f>[9]</f> with whom I am well pleased,”
2 Peter 1-18 we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on <f>ⓕ</f>the holy mountain.
2 Peter 1-19 And <f>ⓖ</f>we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention <f>ⓗ</f>as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until <f>ⓘ</f>the day <f>ⓙ</f>dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,
2 Peter 1-20 knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation.
2 Peter 1-21 For <f>ⓚ</f>no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God <f>ⓛ</f>as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
