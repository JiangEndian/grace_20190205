Judges 21-1 <pb/>Now the men of Israel had sworn <f>ⓐ</f>at Mizpah, “No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin.”
Judges 21-2 And the people came to <f>ⓑ</f>Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly.
Judges 21-3 And they said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?”
Judges 21-4 And the next day the people rose early and <f>ⓒ</f>built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
Judges 21-5 And the people of Israel said, “Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?” <f>ⓓ</f>For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”
Judges 21-6 And the people of Israel <f>ⓔ</f>had compassion for Benjamin their brother and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel this day.
Judges 21-7 <f>ⓕ</f> What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them any of our daughters for wives?”
Judges 21-8 <pb/>And they said, “What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah?” And behold, no one had come to the camp from <f>ⓖ</f>Jabesh-gilead, to the assembly.
Judges 21-9 For when the people were mustered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of <f>ⓗ</f>Jabesh-gilead was there.
Judges 21-10 So the congregation sent 12,000 of their bravest men there and commanded them, <f>ⓘ</f>“Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword; also the women and the little ones.
Judges 21-11 This is what you shall do: <f>ⓙ</f>every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction.”
Judges 21-12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him, and they brought them to the camp at <f>ⓚ</f>Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
Judges 21-13 <pb/>Then the whole congregation sent word to the people of Benjamin who were at the <f>ⓛ</f>rock of Rimmon and <f>ⓜ</f>proclaimed peace to them.
Judges 21-14 And Benjamin returned at that time. And they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead, but they were not enough for them.
Judges 21-15 And the people <f>ⓝ</f>had compassion on Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
Judges 21-16 <pb/>Then the elders of the congregation said, <f>ⓞ</f>“What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?”
Judges 21-17 And they said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.
Judges 21-18 Yet we cannot give them wives from our daughters.” <f>ⓟ</f>For the people of Israel had sworn, “Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin.”
Judges 21-19 So they said, “Behold, there is the yearly feast of the LORD at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of <f>ⓠ</f>the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”
Judges 21-20 And they commanded the people of Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards
Judges 21-21 and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to <f>ⓡ</f>dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
Judges 21-22 And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us, because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.’”
Judges 21-23 And the people of Benjamin did so and took their wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance <f>ⓢ</f>and rebuilt the towns and lived in them.
Judges 21-24 And the people of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.
Judges 21-25 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.

Mark 5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. <f>[1]</f>
Mark 5-2 And when Jesus <f>[2]</f> had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.
Mark 5-3 <f>ⓑ</f> He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain,
Mark 5-4 for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him.
Mark 5-5 Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.
Mark 5-6 And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and <f>ⓒ</f>fell down before him.
Mark 5-7 And <f>ⓓ</f>crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, <f>ⓔ</f>Son of <f>ⓕ</f>the Most High God? <f>ⓖ</f>I adjure you by God, do not torment me.”
Mark 5-8 For he was saying to him, <J>“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”</J>
Mark 5-9 And Jesus asked him, <J>“What is your name?”</J> He replied, “My name is <f>ⓗ</f>Legion, for we are many.”
Mark 5-10 And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country.
Mark 5-11 Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside,
Mark 5-12 and they begged him, saying, “Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.”
Mark 5-13 So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea.
Mark 5-14 <pb/>The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened.
Mark 5-15 And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed <f>[3]</f> man, the one who had had <f>ⓘ</f>the legion, sitting there, <f>ⓙ</f>clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
Mark 5-16 And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.
Mark 5-17 And <f>ⓚ</f>they began to beg Jesus <f>[4]</f> to depart from their region.
Mark 5-18 As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him.
Mark 5-19 And he did not permit him but said to him, <J>“Go home to your friends and <f>ⓛ</f>tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”</J>
Mark 5-20 And he went away and began to proclaim in <f>ⓜ</f>the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.
Mark 5-21 <pb/>And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea.
Mark 5-22 <f>ⓝ</f> Then came one of <f>ⓞ</f>the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet
Mark 5-23 and implored him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and <f>ⓟ</f>lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.”
Mark 5-24 And he went with him. <pb/>And a great crowd followed him and <f>ⓠ</f>thronged about him.
Mark 5-25 And there was a woman <f>ⓡ</f>who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years,
Mark 5-26 and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.
Mark 5-27 She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.
Mark 5-28 For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.”
Mark 5-29 <f>ⓢ</f> And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her <f>ⓣ</f>disease.
Mark 5-30 And Jesus, perceiving in himself that <f>ⓤ</f>power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, <J>“Who touched my garments?”</J>
Mark 5-31 And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, <J>‘Who touched me?’</J>”
Mark 5-32 And he looked around to see who had done it.
Mark 5-33 But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.
Mark 5-34 And he said to her, <J>“Daughter, <f>ⓥ</f>your faith has made you well; <f>ⓦ</f>go in peace, and be healed of your <f>ⓧ</f>disease.”</J>
Mark 5-35 <pb/>While he was still speaking, there came from <f>ⓨ</f>the ruler's house some who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why <f>ⓩ</f>trouble <f>ⓐ</f>the Teacher any further?”
Mark 5-36 But overhearing <f>[5]</f> what they said, Jesus said to <f>ⓑ</f>the ruler of the synagogue, <J>“Do not fear, only believe.”</J>
Mark 5-37 And he allowed no one to follow him except <f>ⓒ</f>Peter and James and <f>ⓓ</f>John the brother of James.
Mark 5-38 They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus <f>[6]</f> saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly.
Mark 5-39 And when he had entered, he said to them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but <f>ⓕ</f>sleeping.”</J>
Mark 5-40 And they laughed at him. But he <f>ⓖ</f>put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was.
Mark 5-41 <f>ⓗ</f> Taking her by the hand he said to her, <J>“Talitha cumi,”</J> which means, <J>“Little girl, I say to you, <f>ⓘ</f>arise.”</J>
Mark 5-42 And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement.
Mark 5-43 And <f>ⓙ</f>he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.
