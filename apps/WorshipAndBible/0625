Daniel 1-1 <pb/>In the third year of <f>ⓐ</f>the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
Daniel 1-2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of <f>ⓑ</f>the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to <f>ⓒ</f>the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, <f>ⓓ</f>and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god.
Daniel 1-3 Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, <f>ⓔ</f>his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family <f>[1]</f> and of <f>ⓕ</f>the nobility,
Daniel 1-4 youths without <f>ⓖ</f>blemish, of good appearance and <f>ⓗ</f>skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king's palace, and to <f>ⓘ</f>teach them the literature and language of the <f>ⓙ</f>Chaldeans.
Daniel 1-5 The king assigned them a daily portion of <f>ⓚ</f>the food that the king ate, and of <f>ⓛ</f>the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for <f>ⓜ</f>three years, and at the end of that time they were to <f>ⓝ</f>stand before the king.
Daniel 1-6 Among these were <f>ⓞ</f>Daniel, <f>ⓟ</f>Hananiah, <f>ⓠ</f>Mishael, and <f>ⓡ</f>Azariah of the tribe of Judah.
Daniel 1-7 And <f>ⓢ</f>the chief of the eunuchs <f>ⓣ</f>gave them names: <f>ⓤ</f>Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.
Daniel 1-8 <pb/>But Daniel <f>ⓥ</f>resolved that he would not <f>ⓦ</f>defile himself with <f>ⓧ</f>the king's food, or with <f>ⓨ</f>the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to <f>ⓩ</f>defile himself.
Daniel 1-9 <f>ⓐ</f> And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs,
Daniel 1-10 and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king.”
Daniel 1-11 Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
Daniel 1-12 “Test your servants for <f>ⓑ</f>ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.
Daniel 1-13 Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat <f>ⓒ</f>the king's food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see.”
Daniel 1-14 So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.
Daniel 1-15 At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate <f>ⓓ</f>the king's food.
Daniel 1-16 <f>ⓔ</f> So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them <f>ⓕ</f>vegetables.
Daniel 1-17 <pb/>As for these four youths, <f>ⓖ</f>God gave them learning and <f>ⓗ</f>skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had <f>ⓘ</f>understanding in all visions and dreams.
Daniel 1-18 At the end of <f>ⓙ</f>the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel 1-19 And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore <f>ⓚ</f>they stood before the king.
Daniel 1-20 And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all <f>ⓛ</f>the magicians and <f>ⓜ</f>enchanters that were in all his kingdom.
Daniel 1-21 And Daniel <f>ⓝ</f>was there until the first year of <f>ⓞ</f>King Cyrus.
