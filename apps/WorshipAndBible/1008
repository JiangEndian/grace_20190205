Judges 15-1 <pb/>After some days, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with <f>ⓐ</f>a young goat. And he said, “I will go in to my wife in the chamber.” But her father would not allow him to go in.
Judges 15-2 And her father said, “I really thought that you utterly hated her, <f>ⓑ</f>so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.”
Judges 15-3 And Samson said to them, “This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines, when I do them harm.”
Judges 15-4 So Samson went and caught 300 foxes and took torches. And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails.
Judges 15-5 And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards.
Judges 15-6 Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?” And they said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife <f>ⓒ</f>and given her to his companion.” And the Philistines came up and <f>ⓓ</f>burned her and her father with fire.
Judges 15-7 And Samson said to them, “If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit.”
Judges 15-8 And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow, and he went down and stayed in the <f>ⓔ</f>cleft of the rock of Etam.
Judges 15-9 <pb/>Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and <f>ⓕ</f>made a raid on <f>ⓖ</f>Lehi.
Judges 15-10 And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us.”
Judges 15-11 Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that <f>ⓗ</f>the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?” And he said to them, “As they did to me, so have I done to them.”
Judges 15-12 And they said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves.”
Judges 15-13 They said to him, “No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands. We will surely not kill you.” So they bound him with two <f>ⓘ</f>new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
Judges 15-14 <pb/>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. <f>ⓙ</f>Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands.
Judges 15-15 And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, <f>ⓚ</f>and with it he struck 1,000 men.
Judges 15-16 And Samson said, <pb/><t>“With the jawbone of a donkey, </t><t>heaps upon heaps, </t><t>with the jawbone of a donkey </t><t>have I struck down a thousand men.” </t>
Judges 15-17 <pb/>As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place <f>ⓛ</f>was called Ramath-lehi. <f>[1]</f>
Judges 15-18 <pb/>And he was very thirsty, and he called upon the LORD and said, <f>ⓜ</f>“You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”
Judges 15-19 And God split open the hollow place that is <f>ⓝ</f>at Lehi, and water came out from it. And when he drank, <f>ⓞ</f>his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore; <f>[2]</f> it is at Lehi to this day.
Judges 15-20 And he judged Israel <f>ⓟ</f>in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

Matthew 27-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people <f>ⓑ</f>took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
Matthew 27-2 And they bound him and <f>ⓒ</f>led him away and <f>ⓓ</f>delivered him over to <f>ⓔ</f>Pilate the governor.
Matthew 27-3 <pb/>Then when <f>ⓕ</f>Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus <f>[1]</f> was condemned, <f>ⓖ</f>he changed his mind and brought back <f>ⓗ</f>the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
Matthew 27-4 saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? <f>ⓘ</f>See to it yourself.”
Matthew 27-5 And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, <f>ⓙ</f>he departed, and he went and hanged himself.
Matthew 27-6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into <f>ⓚ</f>the treasury, since it is blood money.”
Matthew 27-7 So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers.
Matthew 27-8 Therefore <f>ⓛ</f>that field has been called the Field of Blood <f>ⓜ</f>to this day.
Matthew 27-9 <f>ⓝ</f> Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, <f>ⓞ</f>“And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,
Matthew 27-10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.”
Matthew 27-11 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you <f>ⓠ</f>the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, <J> <f>ⓡ</f>“You have said so.”</J>
Matthew 27-12 <f>ⓢ</f> But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.
Matthew 27-13 Then Pilate said to him, <f>ⓣ</f>“Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?”
Matthew 27-14 But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
Matthew 27-15 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.
Matthew 27-16 And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
Matthew 27-17 So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or <f>ⓥ</f>Jesus who is called Christ?”
Matthew 27-18 For he knew that it was out <f>ⓦ</f>of envy that they had delivered him up.
Matthew 27-19 Besides, while he was sitting on <f>ⓧ</f>the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with <f>ⓨ</f>that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today <f>ⓩ</f>in a dream.”
Matthew 27-20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to <f>ⓐ</f>ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
Matthew 27-21 The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.”
Matthew 27-22 Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” <f>ⓑ</f>They all said, “Let him be crucified!”
Matthew 27-23 And he said, “Why? <f>ⓒ</f>What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”
Matthew 27-24 <pb/>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that <f>ⓓ</f>a riot was beginning, he took water and <f>ⓔ</f>washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of <f>ⓕ</f>this man's blood; <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>see to it yourselves.”
Matthew 27-25 And all the people answered, <f>ⓗ</f>“His blood be on us and <f>ⓘ</f>on our children!”
Matthew 27-26 Then he released for them Barabbas, and having <f>ⓙ</f>scourged <f>[3]</f> Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.
Matthew 27-27 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the <f>ⓛ</f>governor's headquarters, <f>[4]</f> and they gathered the whole <f>ⓜ</f>battalion <f>[5]</f> before him.
Matthew 27-28 And they stripped him and put <f>ⓝ</f>a scarlet robe on him,
Matthew 27-29 and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they <f>ⓞ</f>mocked him, saying, “Hail, <f>ⓟ</f>King of the Jews!”
Matthew 27-30 And <f>ⓠ</f>they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.
Matthew 27-31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and <f>ⓡ</f>led him away to crucify him.
Matthew 27-32 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> <f>ⓣ</f>As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to <f>ⓤ</f>carry his cross.
Matthew 27-33 <f>ⓥ</f> And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),
Matthew 27-34 <f>ⓦ</f> they offered him wine to drink, mixed with <f>ⓧ</f>gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.
Matthew 27-35 And when they had crucified him, <f>ⓨ</f>they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
Matthew 27-36 Then they sat down and <f>ⓩ</f>kept watch over him there.
Matthew 27-37 And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, <f>ⓐ</f>the King of the Jews.”
Matthew 27-38 Then two <f>ⓑ</f>robbers were crucified with him, <f>ⓒ</f>one on the right and one on the left.
Matthew 27-39 And <f>ⓓ</f>those who passed by <f>ⓔ</f>derided him, <f>ⓕ</f>wagging their heads
Matthew 27-40 and saying, <f>ⓖ</f>“You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! <f>ⓗ</f>If you are <f>ⓘ</f>the Son of God, come down from the cross.”
Matthew 27-41 So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
Matthew 27-42 <f>ⓙ</f> “He saved others; <f>ⓚ</f>he cannot save himself. <f>ⓛ</f>He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
Matthew 27-43 <f>ⓜ</f> He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”
Matthew 27-44 <f>ⓝ</f> And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
Matthew 27-45 <pb/>Now from the sixth hour <f>[6]</f> there was darkness over all the land <f>[7]</f> until the ninth hour. <f>[8]</f>
Matthew 27-46 And about the ninth hour Jesus <f>ⓞ</f>cried out with a loud voice, saying, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”</J> that is, <J>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</J>
Matthew 27-47 And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
Matthew 27-48 And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with <f>ⓠ</f>sour wine, and put it on a reed and <f>ⓡ</f>gave it to him to drink.
Matthew 27-49 But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”
Matthew 27-50 And Jesus <f>ⓢ</f>cried out again with a loud voice and <f>ⓣ</f>yielded up his spirit.
Matthew 27-51 <pb/>And behold, <f>ⓤ</f>the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And <f>ⓥ</f>the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
Matthew 27-52 The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of <f>ⓦ</f>the saints <f>ⓧ</f>who had fallen asleep were raised,
Matthew 27-53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into <f>ⓨ</f>the holy city and appeared to many.
Matthew 27-54 <f>ⓩ</f> When the centurion and those who were with him, <f>ⓐ</f>keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, <f>ⓑ</f>“Truly this was the Son <f>[9]</f> of God!”
Matthew 27-55 <pb/>There were also <f>ⓒ</f>many women there, looking on <f>ⓓ</f>from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, <f>ⓔ</f>ministering to him,
Matthew 27-56 among whom were <f>ⓕ</f>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and <f>ⓖ</f>the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
Matthew 27-57 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus.
Matthew 27-58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
Matthew 27-59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud
Matthew 27-60 and <f>ⓘ</f>laid it in his own new tomb, <f>ⓙ</f>which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled <f>ⓚ</f>a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
Matthew 27-61 Mary Magdalene and <f>ⓛ</f>the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.
Matthew 27-62 <pb/>The next day, that is, after the day of <f>ⓜ</f>Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
Matthew 27-63 and said, “Sir, we remember how <f>ⓝ</f>that impostor said, while he was still alive, <f>ⓞ</f>‘After three days I will rise.’
Matthew 27-64 Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, <f>ⓟ</f>lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.”
Matthew 27-65 Pilate said to them, “You have <f>ⓠ</f>a guard <f>[10]</f> of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.”
Matthew 27-66 So they went and made the tomb secure by <f>ⓡ</f>sealing the stone and setting a guard.
