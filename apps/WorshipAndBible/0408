43-1 <pb/>Now the famine was <f>ⓐ</f>severe in the land.
43-2 And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.”
43-3 But Judah said to him, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your <f>ⓑ</f>brother is with you.’
43-4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.
43-5 But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’”
43-6 Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?”
43-7 They replied, “The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”
43-8 And Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may <f>ⓒ</f>live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
43-9 I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require him. <f>ⓓ</f>If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever.
43-10 If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.”
43-11 <pb/>Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man, a little <f>ⓔ</f>balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
43-12 Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money <f>ⓕ</f>that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.
43-13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man.
43-14 May <f>ⓖ</f>God Almighty <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓗ</f>grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, <f>ⓘ</f>if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”
43-15 <pb/>So the men took this present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
43-16 <pb/>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the <f>ⓙ</f>steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.”
43-17 The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph's house.
43-18 And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, “It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys.”
43-19 So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house and spoke with him at the door of the house,
43-20 and said, <f>ⓚ</f>“Oh, my lord, <f>ⓛ</f>we came down the first time to buy food.
43-21 And <f>ⓜ</f>when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us,
43-22 and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.”
43-23 He replied, “Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
43-24 And when the man had brought the men into Joseph's house and <f>ⓝ</f>given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder,
43-25 they prepared <f>ⓞ</f>the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
43-26 <pb/>When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and <f>ⓟ</f>bowed down to him to the ground.
43-27 And he inquired about their welfare and said, “Is your father well, the old man <f>ⓠ</f>of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?”
43-28 They said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.” And they <f>ⓡ</f>bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.
43-29 And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, <f>ⓢ</f>his mother's son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, <f>ⓣ</f>of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!”
43-30 Then Joseph hurried out, for <f>ⓤ</f>his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and <f>ⓥ</f>wept there.
43-31 Then he washed his face and came out. And <f>ⓦ</f>controlling himself he said, “Serve the food.”
43-32 They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is <f>ⓧ</f>an abomination to the Egyptians.
43-33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement.
43-34 <f>ⓨ</f> Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was <f>ⓩ</f>five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry <f>[2]</f> with him.
5-1 <pb/>Now the prophets, <f>ⓐ</f>Haggai and <f>ⓑ</f>Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.
5-2 <f>ⓒ</f> Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and <f>ⓓ</f>Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were <f>ⓔ</f>with them, supporting them.
5-3 <pb/>At the same time <f>ⓕ</f>Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus: <f>ⓖ</f>“Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?”
5-4 They also asked them this: <f>[1]</f> “What are the names of the men who are building this building?”
5-5 But <f>ⓗ</f>the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report should reach Darius and then an answer be returned by letter concerning it.
5-6 <pb/>This is a copy of the letter that <f>ⓘ</f>Tattenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and his associates, the <f>ⓙ</f>governors who were in the province Beyond the River, sent to Darius the king.
5-7 They sent him a report, in which was written as follows: “To Darius the king, all peace.
5-8 Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built with huge stones, and timber is laid in the walls. This work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.
5-9 Then we asked those elders and spoke to them thus: <f>ⓚ</f>‘Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?’
5-10 We also asked them their names, for your information, that we might write down the names of their leaders. <f>[2]</f>
5-11 And this was their reply to us: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, <f>ⓛ</f>which a great king of Israel built and <f>ⓜ</f>finished.
5-12 <f>ⓝ</f> But because our fathers had angered the God of heaven, he <f>ⓞ</f>gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia.
5-13 <f>ⓟ</f> However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt.
5-14 <f>ⓠ</f> And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was <f>ⓡ</f>Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
5-15 and he said to him, “Take these vessels, go and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site.”
5-16 Then this <f>ⓢ</f>Sheshbazzar came and <f>ⓣ</f>laid the foundations of the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it has been in building, and it is <f>ⓤ</f>not yet finished.’
5-17 Therefore, if it seems good to the king, <f>ⓥ</f>let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send us his pleasure in this matter.”
28-1 <pb/>In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of <f>ⓐ</f>Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Azzur, the prophet from <f>ⓒ</f>Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,
28-2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓓ</f>I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
28-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Within <f>ⓕ</f>two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.
28-4 I will also bring back to this place <f>ⓖ</f>Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, declares the LORD, <f>ⓗ</f>for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.”
28-5 <pb/>Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD,
28-6 and the prophet Jeremiah said, <f>ⓘ</f>“Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD make the words that you have prophesied come true, and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the LORD, and all the exiles.
28-7 Yet hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
28-8 <f>ⓙ</f> The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms.
28-9 <f>ⓚ</f> As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the LORD has truly sent the prophet.”
28-10 <pb/>Then the prophet Hananiah took the <f>ⓛ</f>yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke them.
28-11 And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, <f>ⓜ</f>“Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓝ</f>Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of <f>ⓞ</f>all the nations within two years.” But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.
28-12 <pb/>Sometime after the prophet <f>ⓟ</f>Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
28-13 “Go, tell Hananiah, ‘Thus says the LORD: You have broken wooden bars, but you have made in their place bars of iron.
28-14 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations <f>ⓠ</f>an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, <f>ⓡ</f>and they shall serve him, <f>ⓢ</f>for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.’”
28-15 And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah, <f>ⓣ</f>the LORD has not sent you, <f>ⓤ</f>and you have made this people trust in a lie.
28-16 Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, <f>ⓥ</f>because you have uttered rebellion against the LORD.’”
28-17 <pb/>In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.
6-1 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓐ</f>let us leave <f>ⓑ</f>the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance <f>ⓒ</f>from dead works and of faith toward God,
6-2 and of <f>ⓓ</f>instruction about washings, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>the laying on of hands, <f>ⓕ</f>the resurrection of the dead, and <f>ⓖ</f>eternal judgment.
6-3 And this we will do <f>ⓗ</f>if God permits.
6-4 For it is impossible, in the case of those <f>ⓘ</f>who have once been enlightened, who have tasted <f>ⓙ</f>the heavenly gift, and <f>ⓚ</f>have shared in the Holy Spirit,
6-5 and <f>ⓛ</f>have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,
6-6 and <f>ⓜ</f>then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since <f>ⓝ</f>they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.
6-7 For <f>ⓞ</f>land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.
6-8 But <f>ⓟ</f>if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, <f>ⓠ</f>and its end is to be burned.
6-9 <pb/>Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things — things that belong to salvation.
6-10 For <f>ⓡ</f>God is not unjust so as to overlook <f>ⓢ</f>your work and the love that you have shown for his name in <f>ⓣ</f>serving the saints, as you still do.
6-11 And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance <f>ⓤ</f>of hope until the end,
6-12 so that you may not be sluggish, but <f>ⓥ</f>imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
6-13 <pb/>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, <f>ⓦ</f>he swore by himself,
6-14 saying, <f>ⓧ</f>“Surely I will bless you and multiply you.”
6-15 And thus Abraham, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓨ</f>having patiently waited, obtained the promise.
6-16 For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes <f>ⓩ</f>an oath is final for confirmation.
6-17 So when God desired to show more convincingly to <f>ⓐ</f>the heirs of the promise <f>ⓑ</f>the unchangeable character of his purpose, <f>ⓒ</f>he guaranteed it with an oath,
6-18 so that by two unchangeable things, in which <f>ⓓ</f>it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope <f>ⓔ</f>set before us.
6-19 We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into <f>ⓕ</f>the inner place behind the curtain,
6-20 where Jesus has gone <f>ⓖ</f>as a forerunner on our behalf, <f>ⓗ</f>having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
