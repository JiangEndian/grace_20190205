19-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, <f>ⓑ</f>he tore his clothes and <f>ⓒ</f>covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the LORD.
19-2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, <f>ⓓ</f>covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.
19-3 They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.
19-4 <f>ⓔ</f> It may be that the LORD your God heard all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent <f>ⓕ</f>to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for <f>ⓖ</f>the remnant that is left.”
19-5 When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
19-6 Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which <f>ⓗ</f>the servants of the king of Assyria have <f>ⓘ</f>reviled me.
19-7 Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that <f>ⓙ</f>he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will make him <f>ⓚ</f>fall by the sword in his own land.’”
19-8 <pb/>The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against <f>ⓛ</f>Libnah, for he heard that the king had left <f>ⓜ</f>Lachish.
19-9 <f>ⓝ</f> Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, “Behold, he has set out to fight against you.” So he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
19-10 “Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God <f>ⓞ</f>in whom you trust deceive you by promising that <f>ⓟ</f>Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
19-11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered?
19-12 <f>ⓠ</f> Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed, <f>ⓡ</f>Gozan, <f>ⓢ</f>Haran, Rezeph, and the people of <f>ⓣ</f>Eden who were in Telassar?
19-13 <f>ⓤ</f> Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’”
19-14 <pb/>Hezekiah received <f>ⓥ</f>the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD and spread it before the LORD.
19-15 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD and said: “O LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓦ</f>enthroned above the cherubim, <f>ⓧ</f>you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
19-16 <f>ⓨ</f> Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; <f>ⓩ</f>open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent <f>ⓐ</f>to mock the living God.
19-17 Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands
19-18 and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, <f>ⓑ</f>but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed.
19-19 So now, O LORD our God, save us, please, from his hand, <f>ⓒ</f>that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that <f>ⓓ</f>you, O LORD, are God alone.”
19-20 <pb/>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Your prayer to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria <f>ⓔ</f>I have heard.
19-21 This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him: <pb/><t>“She despises you, she scorns you — </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the virgin daughter of Zion; </t><t>she <f>ⓖ</f>wags her head behind you — </t><t>the daughter of Jerusalem. </t>
19-22 <pb/><t>“Whom have you <f>ⓗ</f>mocked and <f>ⓘ</f>reviled? </t><t>Against whom have you raised your voice </t><t>and lifted your eyes to the heights? </t><t>Against <f>ⓙ</f>the Holy One of Israel!</t>
19-23 <t><f>ⓚ</f> By your messengers you have mocked the Lord, </t><t>and you have said, <f>ⓛ</f>‘With my many chariots </t><t>I have gone up the heights of the mountains, </t><t>to the far recesses of <f>ⓜ</f>Lebanon; </t><t>I felled its tallest cedars, </t><t>its choicest cypresses; </t><t>I entered its farthest lodging place, </t><t>its most <f>ⓝ</f>fruitful forest.</t>
19-24 <t>I dug wells </t><t>and drank foreign waters, </t><t>and I dried up with the sole of my foot </t><t>all the streams <f>ⓞ</f>of Egypt.’ </t>
19-25 <pb/><t>“Have you not heard </t><t>that <f>ⓟ</f>I determined it long ago? </t><t>I planned from days of old </t><t>what <f>ⓠ</f>now I bring to pass, </t><t>that you should turn fortified cities </t><t>into heaps of ruins,</t>
19-26 <t>while their inhabitants, shorn of strength, </t><t>are dismayed and confounded, </t><t>and have become <f>ⓡ</f>like plants of the field </t><t>and like tender grass, </t><t>like grass on the housetops, </t><t>blighted before it is grown. </t>
19-27 <pb/><t>“But I know your sitting down </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>and your going out and coming in, </t><t>and your raging against me.</t>
19-28 <t>Because you have raged against me </t><t>and your complacency has come into my ears, </t><t>I will <f>ⓣ</f>put my hook in your nose </t><t>and my bit in your mouth, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>I will turn you back on the way </t><t>by which you came. </t>
19-29 <pb/>“And this shall be <f>ⓥ</f>the sign for you: this year eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs of the same. Then in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
19-30 <f>ⓦ</f> And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
19-31 For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion <f>ⓧ</f>a band of survivors. <f>ⓨ</f>The zeal of the LORD will do this.
19-32 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there, or come before it with a shield or <f>ⓩ</f>cast up a siege mound against it.
19-33 <f>ⓐ</f> By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, declares the LORD.
19-34 <f>ⓑ</f> For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake <f>ⓒ</f>and for the sake of my servant David.”
19-35 <pb/>And that night <f>ⓓ</f>the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
19-36 Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went home and lived at <f>ⓔ</f>Nineveh.
19-37 And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, <f>ⓕ</f>Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword and escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
18-1 <pb/><t>Ah, land of <f>ⓐ</f>whirring wings </t><t>that is beyond the rivers of <f>ⓑ</f>Cush, <f>[1]</f></t>
18-2 <t>which <f>ⓒ</f>sends ambassadors by the sea, </t><t>in vessels of papyrus on the waters! </t><t>Go, you swift messengers, </t><t>to a nation <f>ⓓ</f>tall and smooth, </t><t>to a people feared near and far, </t><t>a nation <f>ⓔ</f>mighty and conquering, </t><t>whose land the rivers divide. </t>
18-3 <pb/><t>All you inhabitants of the world, </t><t>you who dwell on the earth, </t><t>when <f>ⓕ</f>a signal is raised on the mountains, look! </t><t>When a trumpet is blown, hear!</t>
18-4 <t>For thus the LORD said to me: </t><t>“I will quietly look <f>ⓖ</f>from my dwelling </t><t>like clear heat in sunshine, </t><t>like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”</t>
18-5 <t><f>ⓗ</f> For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, </t><t>and the flower becomes a ripening grape, </t><t>he cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks, </t><t>and the spreading branches he lops off and clears away.</t>
18-6 <t><f>ⓘ</f> They shall all of them be left </t><t>to the birds of prey of the mountains </t><t>and to the beasts of the earth. </t><t>And the birds of prey will summer on them, </t><t>and all the beasts of the earth will winter on them. </t>
18-7 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> At that time tribute will be brought to the LORD of hosts <pb/><t>from a people <f>ⓚ</f>tall and smooth, </t><t>from a people feared near and far, </t><t>a nation mighty and conquering, </t><t>whose land the rivers divide, </t> <pb/>to <f>ⓛ</f>Mount Zion, the place of the <f>ⓜ</f>name of the LORD of hosts.
16-1 <pb/>I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant <f>[1]</f> of the church at <f>ⓐ</f>Cenchreae,
16-2 that you <f>ⓑ</f>may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints, and help her in whatever she may need from you, for she has been a patron of many and of myself as well.
16-3 <pb/>Greet <f>ⓒ</f>Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
16-4 who risked their necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks but all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks as well.
16-5 Greet also <f>ⓓ</f>the church in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was <f>ⓔ</f>the first convert <f>[2]</f> to Christ in Asia.
16-6 Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.
16-7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, <f>[3]</f> my kinsmen and my <f>ⓕ</f>fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, <f>[4]</f> and they were in Christ before me.
16-8 Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.
16-9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys.
16-10 Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those <f>ⓖ</f>who belong to the family of Aristobulus.
16-11 Greet my kinsman Herodion. Greet those in the Lord who belong to the family of Narcissus.
16-12 Greet those workers in the Lord, Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Greet the beloved Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord.
16-13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord; also his mother, who has been a mother to me as well.
16-14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers <f>[5]</f> who are with them.
16-15 Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
16-16 <f>ⓗ</f> Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
16-17 <pb/>I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles <f>ⓘ</f>contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; <f>ⓙ</f>avoid them.
16-18 For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but <f>ⓚ</f>their own appetites, <f>[6]</f> and <f>ⓛ</f>by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.
16-19 For <f>ⓜ</f>your obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, but I want you <f>ⓝ</f>to be wise as to what is good and innocent as to what is evil.
16-20 <f>ⓞ</f> The God of peace <f>ⓟ</f>will soon crush Satan under your feet. <f>ⓠ</f>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
16-21 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you; so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.

16-26 but <f>ⓩ</f>has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, <f>ⓐ</f>to bring about the obedience of faith —
16-27 to <f>ⓑ</f>the only wise God <f>ⓒ</f>be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ! Amen.
