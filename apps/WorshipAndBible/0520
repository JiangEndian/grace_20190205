Exodus 35-1 <pb/>Moses assembled all the congregation of the people of Israel and said to them, <f>ⓐ</f>“These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do.
Exodus 35-2 <f>ⓑ</f> Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.
Exodus 35-3 <f>ⓒ</f> You shall kindle no fire in all your dwelling places on the Sabbath day.”
Exodus 35-4 <pb/>Moses said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, “This is the thing that the LORD has commanded.
Exodus 35-5 <f>ⓓ</f> Take from among you a contribution to the LORD. <f>ⓔ</f>Whoever is of a generous heart, let him bring the LORD's contribution: gold, silver, and bronze;
Exodus 35-6 blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen; goats' hair,
Exodus 35-7 tanned rams' skins, and goatskins; <f>[1]</f> acacia wood,
Exodus 35-8 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
Exodus 35-9 and onyx stones and stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastpiece.
Exodus 35-10 <pb/>“Let <f>ⓕ</f>every skillful craftsman among you come and make all that the LORD has commanded:
Exodus 35-11 <f>ⓖ</f> the tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its hooks and its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;
Exodus 35-12 <f>ⓗ</f> the ark with its poles, the mercy seat, and the <f>ⓘ</f>veil of the screen;
Exodus 35-13 <f>ⓙ</f> the table with its poles and all its utensils, and the <f>ⓚ</f>bread of the Presence;
Exodus 35-14 <f>ⓛ</f> the lampstand also for the light, with its utensils and its lamps, and the <f>ⓜ</f>oil for the light;
Exodus 35-15 <f>ⓝ</f> and the altar of incense, with its poles, <f>ⓞ</f>and the anointing oil and the <f>ⓟ</f>fragrant incense, and <f>ⓠ</f>the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle;
Exodus 35-16 <f>ⓡ</f> the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils, the <f>ⓢ</f>basin and its stand;
Exodus 35-17 <f>ⓣ</f> the hangings of the court, its pillars and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the court;
Exodus 35-18 <f>ⓤ</f> the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court, and their <f>ⓥ</f>cords;
Exodus 35-19 the <f>ⓦ</f>finely worked garments for ministering <f>[2]</f> in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for their service as priests.”
Exodus 35-20 <pb/>Then all the congregation of the people of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
Exodus 35-21 And they came, <f>ⓧ</f>everyone whose heart stirred him, and everyone whose spirit moved him, <f>ⓨ</f>and brought the LORD's contribution to be used for the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments.
Exodus 35-22 So they came, both men and women. All who were of a willing heart brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and armlets, all sorts of gold objects, every man dedicating an offering of gold to the LORD.
Exodus 35-23 And <f>ⓩ</f>every one who possessed <f>ⓐ</f>blue or purple or scarlet yarns or fine linen or goats' hair or tanned rams' skins or goatskins brought them.
Exodus 35-24 <f>ⓑ</f> Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought it as the LORD's contribution. And every one who possessed acacia wood of any use in the work brought it.
Exodus 35-25 And every <f>ⓒ</f>skillful woman spun with her hands, and they all brought what they had spun in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen.
Exodus 35-26 All the women <f>ⓓ</f>whose hearts stirred them to use their skill spun the goats' hair.
Exodus 35-27 And the <f>ⓔ</f>leaders brought onyx stones and stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastpiece,
Exodus 35-28 and spices and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
Exodus 35-29 <f>ⓕ</f> All the men and women, the people of Israel, whose heart moved them to bring anything for the work that the LORD had commanded by Moses to be done brought it as a freewill offering to the LORD.
Exodus 35-30 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Then Moses said to the people of Israel, “See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
Exodus 35-31 and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with <f>ⓗ</f>skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship,
Exodus 35-32 to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze,
Exodus 35-33 in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft.
Exodus 35-34 And he has inspired him to teach, both him and Oholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan.
Exodus 35-35 He has <f>ⓘ</f>filled them with skill to do every sort of work done by an engraver or by a designer or by an embroiderer in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, or by a weaver — by any sort of workman or skilled designer.

Ezekiel 13-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 13-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, who are prophesying, and say to those <f>ⓑ</f>who prophesy from their own hearts: ‘Hear the word of the LORD!’
Ezekiel 13-3 Thus says the Lord GOD, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
Ezekiel 13-4 Your prophets have been like jackals among ruins, O Israel.
Ezekiel 13-5 <f>ⓒ</f> You have not gone up into the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in battle in the day of the LORD.
Ezekiel 13-6 <f>ⓓ</f> They have seen false visions and lying divinations. They say, ‘Declares the LORD,’ <f>ⓔ</f>when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfill their word.
Ezekiel 13-7 Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination, <f>ⓕ</f>whenever you have said, ‘Declares the LORD,’ although I have not spoken?”
Ezekiel 13-8 <pb/>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Because you have uttered falsehood and seen lying visions, therefore behold, <f>ⓖ</f>I am against you, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 13-9 My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who give lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, <f>ⓗ</f>nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, <f>ⓘ</f>nor shall they enter the land of Israel. <f>ⓙ</f>And you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 13-10 Precisely because they have misled my people, <f>ⓚ</f>saying, ‘Peace,’ when there is no peace, and because, when the people build a wall, <f>ⓛ</f>these prophets smear it with whitewash, <f>[1]</f>
Ezekiel 13-11 say to those who smear it with whitewash that it shall fall! <f>ⓜ</f>There will be a deluge of rain, and you, O great hailstones, will fall, and a stormy wind break out.
Ezekiel 13-12 And when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, ‘Where is the coating with which you smeared it?’
Ezekiel 13-13 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓝ</f>I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, <f>ⓞ</f>and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end.
Ezekiel 13-14 And I will break down the wall that you have smeared with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. When it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it, <f>ⓟ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 13-15 Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall and upon those who have smeared it with whitewash, and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who smeared it,
Ezekiel 13-16 the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem <f>ⓠ</f>and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 13-17 <pb/>“And you, son of man, <f>ⓡ</f>set your face against <f>ⓢ</f>the daughters of your people, <f>ⓣ</f>who prophesy out of their own hearts. Prophesy against them
Ezekiel 13-18 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women <f>ⓤ</f>who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and <f>ⓥ</f>make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in <f>ⓦ</f>the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people and keep your own souls alive?
Ezekiel 13-19 You have profaned me among my people <f>ⓧ</f>for handfuls of barley <f>ⓨ</f>and for pieces of bread, putting to death souls who should not die and keeping alive souls who should not live, by your lying to my people, who listen to lies.
Ezekiel 13-20 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, <f>ⓩ</f>I am against <f>ⓐ</f>your magic bands with which you hunt the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls whom you hunt go free, the souls like birds.
Ezekiel 13-21 Your veils also I will tear off and <f>ⓑ</f>deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey, <f>ⓒ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.
Ezekiel 13-22 <f>ⓓ</f> Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not grieved him, and <f>ⓔ</f>you have encouraged the wicked, that <f>ⓕ</f>he should not turn from his evil way to save his life,
Ezekiel 13-23 <f>ⓖ</f> therefore you shall no more see false visions nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the LORD.”
Revelation 14-1 <pb/>Then I looked, and behold, on <f>ⓐ</f>Mount Zion <f>ⓑ</f>stood the Lamb, and with him <f>ⓒ</f>144,000 who <f>ⓓ</f>had his name and his Father's name written <f>ⓔ</f>on their foreheads.
Revelation 14-2 And I heard a voice from heaven <f>ⓕ</f>like the roar of many waters and <f>ⓖ</f>like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of <f>ⓗ</f>harpists playing on their harps,
Revelation 14-3 and they were singing <f>ⓘ</f>a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. <f>ⓙ</f>No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
Revelation 14-4 It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for <f>ⓚ</f>they are virgins. It is these <f>ⓛ</f>who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as <f>ⓜ</f>firstfruits for God and the Lamb,
Revelation 14-5 and <f>ⓝ</f>in their mouth no lie was found, for they are <f>ⓞ</f>blameless.
Revelation 14-6 <pb/>Then I saw another angel <f>ⓟ</f>flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to <f>ⓠ</f>those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.
Revelation 14-7 And he said with a loud voice, <f>ⓡ</f>“Fear God and <f>ⓢ</f>give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and <f>ⓣ</f>worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the <f>ⓤ</f>springs of water.”
Revelation 14-8 <pb/>Another angel, a second, followed, saying, <f>ⓥ</f>“Fallen, fallen is <f>ⓦ</f>Babylon the great, <f>ⓧ</f>she who made all nations drink <f>ⓨ</f>the wine of the passion <f>[1]</f> of her sexual immorality.”
Revelation 14-9 <pb/>And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone <f>ⓩ</f>worships the beast and its image and receives <f>ⓐ</f>a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
Revelation 14-10 he also will drink <f>ⓑ</f>the wine of God's wrath, <f>ⓒ</f>poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and <f>ⓓ</f>he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
Revelation 14-11 And <f>ⓔ</f>the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and <f>ⓕ</f>they have no rest, day or night, these <f>ⓖ</f>worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.”
Revelation 14-12 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who <f>ⓘ</f>keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus. <f>[2]</f>
Revelation 14-13 <pb/>And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: <f>ⓙ</f>Blessed are the dead <f>ⓚ</f>who die in the Lord from now on.” “Blessed indeed,” says the Spirit, <f>ⓛ</f>“that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!”
Revelation 14-14 <pb/>Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one <f>ⓜ</f>like a son of man, <f>ⓝ</f>with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.
Revelation 14-15 And another angel <f>ⓞ</f>came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, <f>ⓟ</f>“Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for <f>ⓠ</f>the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”
Revelation 14-16 So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was reaped.
Revelation 14-17 <pb/>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
Revelation 14-18 And another angel came out from the altar, <f>ⓡ</f>the angel who has authority over the fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, “Put in your sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, <f>ⓢ</f>for its grapes are ripe.”
Revelation 14-19 So the angel swung his sickle across the earth and gathered the grape harvest of the earth and threw it into the great <f>ⓣ</f>winepress of the wrath of God.
Revelation 14-20 And <f>ⓤ</f>the winepress was trodden <f>ⓥ</f>outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress, as high as <f>ⓦ</f>a horse's bridle, for 1,600 stadia. <f>[3]</f>
