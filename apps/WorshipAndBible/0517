32-1 <pb/>When the people saw that Moses <f>ⓐ</f>delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to him, <f>ⓑ</f>“Up, make us gods who shall <f>ⓒ</f>go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”
32-2 So Aaron said to them, “Take off the <f>ⓓ</f>rings of gold that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”
32-3 So all the people took off the rings of gold that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.
32-4 <f>ⓔ</f> And he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made a golden <f>[1]</f> calf. And they said, <f>ⓕ</f>“These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”
32-5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron <f>ⓖ</f>made a proclamation and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.”
32-6 And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And <f>ⓗ</f>the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up <f>ⓘ</f>to play.
32-7 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓙ</f>“Go down, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have <f>ⓚ</f>corrupted themselves.
32-8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way that <f>ⓛ</f>I commanded them. They have made for themselves a golden calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!’”
32-9 And the LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, <f>ⓜ</f>it is a stiff-necked people.
32-10 Now therefore <f>ⓝ</f>let me alone, that <f>ⓞ</f>my wrath may burn hot against them and <f>ⓟ</f>I may consume them, in order that <f>ⓠ</f>I may make a great nation of you.”
32-11 <pb/>But <f>ⓡ</f>Moses implored the LORD his God and said, “O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
32-12 <f>ⓢ</f> Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent did he bring them out, to kill them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger and <f>ⓣ</f>relent from this disaster against your people.
32-13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you <f>ⓤ</f>swore by your own self, and said to them, <f>ⓥ</f>‘I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”
32-14 And the LORD <f>ⓦ</f>relented from the disaster that he had spoken of bringing on his people.
32-15 <pb/>Then <f>ⓧ</f>Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the <f>ⓨ</f>two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides; on the front and on the back they were written.
32-16 <f>ⓩ</f> The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
32-17 When <f>ⓐ</f>Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a noise of war in the camp.”
32-18 But he said, “It is not the sound of <f>ⓑ</f>shouting for victory, or the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear.”
32-19 And as soon as he came near the camp and <f>ⓒ</f>saw the calf and the dancing, Moses' anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
32-20 He took the calf that they had made and burned it with fire and ground it to powder and scattered it on the water and made the people of Israel drink it.
32-21 <pb/>And Moses said to Aaron, <f>ⓓ</f>“What did this people do to you that you have brought such a great sin upon them?”
32-22 And Aaron said, “Let not the anger of my lord burn hot. <f>ⓔ</f>You know the people, that they are set on evil.
32-23 For <f>ⓕ</f>they said to me, ‘Make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’
32-24 So <f>ⓖ</f>I said to them, ‘Let any who have gold take it off.’ So they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”
32-25 <pb/>And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, <f>ⓗ</f>to the derision of their enemies),
32-26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, “Who is on the LORD's side? Come to me.” And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.
32-27 And he said to them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Put your sword on your side each of you, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you <f>ⓘ</f>kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor.’”
32-28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And that day about three thousand men of the people fell.
32-29 And Moses said, “Today you have been <f>ⓙ</f>ordained for the service of the LORD, each one at the cost of his son and of his brother, so that he might bestow a blessing upon you this day.”
32-30 <pb/>The next day Moses said to the people, <f>ⓚ</f>“You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the LORD; <f>ⓛ</f>perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”
32-31 So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Alas, <f>ⓜ</f>this people has sinned a great sin. They have <f>ⓝ</f>made for themselves gods of gold.
32-32 But now, if <f>ⓞ</f>you will forgive their sin — but if not, please <f>ⓟ</f>blot me out of <f>ⓠ</f>your book that you have written.”
32-33 But the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓡ</f>“Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book.
32-34 <f>ⓢ</f> But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; <f>ⓣ</f>behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.”
32-35 <pb/>Then the LORD sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf, the one that Aaron made.
11-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
11-2 <pb/><t>“Should <f>ⓑ</f>a multitude of words go unanswered, </t><t>and a man full of talk be judged right?</t>
11-3 <t>Should your babble silence men, </t><t>and when you mock, shall no one shame you?</t>
11-4 <t>For <f>ⓒ</f>you say, ‘My <f>ⓓ</f>doctrine is pure, </t><t>and I am clean in God's <f>[1]</f> eyes.’</t>
11-5 <t>But oh, that God would speak </t><t>and open his lips to you,</t>
11-6 <t>and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! </t><t>For he is manifold in <f>ⓔ</f>understanding. <f>[2]</f> </t><t>Know then that God <f>ⓕ</f>exacts of you less than your guilt deserves. </t>
11-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> “Can you find out the deep things of God? </t><t>Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?</t>
11-8 <t>It is <f>ⓗ</f>higher than heaven <f>[3]</f> — what can you do? </t><t>Deeper than Sheol — what can you know?</t>
11-9 <t>Its measure is longer than the earth </t><t>and broader than the sea.</t>
11-10 <t>If he <f>ⓘ</f>passes through and <f>ⓙ</f>imprisons </t><t>and summons the court, who can <f>ⓚ</f>turn him back?</t>
11-11 <t>For he knows <f>ⓛ</f>worthless men; </t><t>when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it?</t>
11-12 <t>But a stupid man will get understanding </t><t>when <f>ⓜ</f>a wild donkey's colt is <f>ⓝ</f>born a man! </t>
11-13 <pb/><t>“If you <f>ⓞ</f>prepare your heart, </t><t>you will <f>ⓟ</f>stretch out your hands toward him.</t>
11-14 <t>If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, </t><t>and let not injustice dwell in your tents.</t>
11-15 <t>Surely then you will <f>ⓠ</f>lift up your face without <f>ⓡ</f>blemish; </t><t>you will be secure and will not fear.</t>
11-16 <t>You will <f>ⓢ</f>forget your misery; </t><t>you will remember it as waters that have passed away.</t>
11-17 <t>And your life will be <f>ⓣ</f>brighter than the noonday; </t><t>its darkness will be like the morning.</t>
11-18 <t>And you will feel secure, because there is hope; </t><t>you will look around and <f>ⓤ</f>take your rest in security.</t>
11-19 <t>You will <f>ⓥ</f>lie down, and none will make you afraid; </t><t>many will <f>ⓦ</f>court your favor.</t>
11-20 <t>But <f>ⓧ</f>the eyes of the wicked will fail; </t><t>all way of escape will be lost to them, </t><t>and their hope is <f>ⓨ</f>to breathe their last.” </t>
10-1 <pb/>Then I looked, and behold, <f>ⓐ</f>on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something <f>ⓑ</f>like a sapphire, <f>[1]</f> in appearance like a throne.
10-2 And he said to <f>ⓒ</f>the man clothed in linen, “Go in among <f>ⓓ</f>the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with <f>ⓔ</f>burning coals from between the cherubim, and <f>ⓕ</f>scatter them over the city.” <pb/>And he went in <f>ⓖ</f>before my eyes.
10-3 Now the cherubim were standing <f>ⓗ</f>on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and <f>ⓘ</f>a cloud filled <f>ⓙ</f>the inner court.
10-4 And <f>ⓚ</f>the glory of the LORD <f>ⓛ</f>went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house <f>ⓜ</f>was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with <f>ⓝ</f>the brightness of the glory of the LORD.
10-5 And <f>ⓞ</f>the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, <f>ⓟ</f>like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
10-6 <pb/>And when he commanded <f>ⓠ</f>the man clothed in linen, <f>ⓡ</f>“Take fire from between <f>ⓢ</f>the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he went in and stood beside a wheel.
10-7 And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
10-8 The cherubim appeared to have <f>ⓣ</f>the form of a human hand under their wings.
10-9 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub, and <f>ⓥ</f>the appearance of the wheels was <f>ⓦ</f>like sparkling <f>ⓧ</f>beryl.
10-10 And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.
10-11 <f>ⓨ</f> When they went, they went in any of their four directions <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>without turning as they went, <f>ⓐ</f>but in whatever direction the front wheel <f>[3]</f> faced, the others followed without turning as they went.
10-12 <f>ⓑ</f> And their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, <f>[4]</f> and the wheels were full of eyes all around — the wheels that the four of them had.
10-13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing <f>ⓒ</f>“the whirling wheels.”
10-14 <f>ⓓ</f> And every one had four faces: <f>ⓔ</f>the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was <f>ⓕ</f>a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
10-15 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And the cherubim mounted up. These were <f>ⓗ</f>the living creatures that I saw by <f>ⓘ</f>the Chebar canal.
10-16 <f>ⓙ</f> And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And <f>ⓚ</f>when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them.
10-17 <f>ⓛ</f> When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them, for the spirit of the living creatures <f>[5]</f> was in them.
10-18 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Then <f>ⓝ</f>the glory of the LORD went out from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
10-19 <f>ⓞ</f> And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth <f>ⓟ</f>before my eyes as they went out, with the wheels beside them. And they stood at the entrance of the <f>ⓠ</f>east gate of the house of the LORD, and <f>ⓡ</f>the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
10-20 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> These were the living creatures that I saw <f>ⓣ</f>underneath the God of Israel by <f>ⓤ</f>the Chebar canal; and I knew that they were cherubim.
10-21 <f>ⓥ</f> Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings <f>ⓦ</f>the likeness of human hands.
10-22 <f>ⓧ</f> And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the Chebar canal. <f>ⓨ</f>Each one of them went straight forward.
11-1 <pb/>Then I was given <f>ⓐ</f>a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, “Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there,
11-2 but do not measure <f>ⓑ</f>the court outside the temple; leave that out, for <f>ⓒ</f>it is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for <f>ⓓ</f>forty-two months.
11-3 And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for <f>ⓔ</f>1,260 days, <f>ⓕ</f>clothed in sackcloth.”
11-4 <pb/>These are <f>ⓖ</f>the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
11-5 And if anyone would harm them, <f>ⓗ</f>fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them, <f>ⓘ</f>this is how he is doomed to be killed.
11-6 They have the power <f>ⓙ</f>to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and <f>ⓚ</f>to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire.
11-7 And when they have finished their testimony, <f>ⓛ</f>the beast that rises from <f>ⓜ</f>the bottomless pit <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>will make war on them and conquer them and kill them,
11-8 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically <f>[2]</f> is called <f>ⓞ</f>Sodom and <f>ⓟ</f>Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.
11-9 For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and <f>ⓠ</f>refuse to let them be placed in a tomb,
11-10 and <f>ⓡ</f>those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and <f>ⓢ</f>exchange presents, because these two prophets <f>ⓣ</f>had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth.
11-11 But after the three and a half days <f>ⓤ</f>a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them.
11-12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, <f>ⓥ</f>“Come up here!” And <f>ⓦ</f>they went up to heaven <f>ⓧ</f>in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
11-13 And at that hour there was <f>ⓨ</f>a great earthquake, and <f>ⓩ</f>a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and <f>ⓐ</f>gave glory to <f>ⓑ</f>the God of heaven.
11-14 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come.
11-15 <pb/>Then <f>ⓓ</f>the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and <f>ⓔ</f>there were loud voices in heaven, saying, <f>ⓕ</f>“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of <f>ⓖ</f>his Christ, and <f>ⓗ</f>he shall reign forever and ever.”
11-16 And the twenty-four elders <f>ⓘ</f>who sit on their thrones before God <f>ⓙ</f>fell on their faces and worshiped God,
11-17 saying, <pb/><t>“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>who is and who was, </t><t>for you have taken your great power </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>begun to reign.</t>
11-18 <t>The nations raged, </t><t>but <f>ⓜ</f>your wrath came, </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>the time for the dead to be judged, </t><t>and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>those who fear your name, </t><t>both small and great, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>for destroying the destroyers of the earth.” </t>
11-19 <pb/>Then <f>ⓠ</f>God's temple in heaven was opened, and <f>ⓡ</f>the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, <f>[3]</f> peals of thunder, an earthquake, and <f>ⓢ</f>heavy hail.
