9-1 <pb/>And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, <f>ⓐ</f>“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
9-2 <f>ⓑ</f> The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are delivered.
9-3 <f>ⓒ</f> Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And <f>ⓓ</f>as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
9-4 But you shall not eat flesh with its <f>ⓔ</f>life, that is, its blood.
9-5 And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: <f>ⓕ</f>from every beast I will require it and <f>ⓖ</f>from man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man.
9-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> “Whoever sheds the blood of man, </t><t>by man shall his blood be shed, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>for God made man in his own image. </t>
9-7 <pb/>And you, <f>[1]</f> be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it.”
9-8 <pb/>Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
9-9 “Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you,
9-10 and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth.
9-11 <f>ⓚ</f> I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”
9-12 And God said, <f>ⓛ</f>“This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:
9-13 I have set <f>ⓜ</f>my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
9-14 When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
9-15 <f>ⓝ</f> I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
9-16 When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember <f>ⓞ</f>the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”
9-17 God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
9-18 <pb/>The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were <f>ⓟ</f>Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
9-19 These three were the sons of Noah, and <f>ⓠ</f>from these the people of the whole earth were dispersed. <f>[2]</f>
9-20 <pb/>Noah began to be a man of the soil, and he planted a vineyard. <f>[3]</f>
9-21 He drank of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered in his tent.
9-22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside.
9-23 Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were turned backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
9-24 When Noah awoke from his wine <f>ⓡ</f>and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
9-25 he said, <pb/><t><f>ⓢ</f>“Cursed be Canaan; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.” </t>
9-26 <pb/>He also said, <pb/><t>“Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem; </t><t>and let Canaan be his servant.</t>
9-27 <t>May God enlarge Japheth, <f>[4]</f> </t><t>and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, </t><t>and let Canaan be his servant.” </t>
9-28 <pb/>After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
9-29 All the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.
7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, <f>ⓑ</f>fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, <f>ⓒ</f>and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
7-2 And the priests could not enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD filled the LORD's house.
7-3 When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the LORD on the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, “For he is good, <f>ⓓ</f>for his steadfast love endures forever.”
7-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the LORD.
7-5 King Solomon offered as a sacrifice 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
7-6 The priests stood at their posts; <f>ⓕ</f>the Levites also, with the instruments for music to the LORD that King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD — <f>ⓖ</f>for his steadfast love endures forever — whenever David offered praises by their ministry; <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓗ</f>opposite them the priests sounded trumpets, and all Israel stood.
7-7 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar Solomon had made could not hold the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat.
7-8 <pb/>At that time Solomon held the feast for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from <f>ⓙ</f>Lebo-hamath to the <f>ⓚ</f>Brook of Egypt.
7-9 And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they had kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days.
7-10 On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the prosperity <f>[2]</f> that the LORD had granted to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.
7-11 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's house. All that Solomon had planned to do in the house of the LORD and in his own house he successfully accomplished.
7-12 Then the LORD appeared to Solomon in the night and said to him: “I have heard your prayer <f>ⓜ</f>and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
7-13 <f>ⓝ</f> When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command the locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,
7-14 if my people who are called by my name <f>ⓞ</f>humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
7-15 <f>ⓟ</f> Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
7-16 <f>ⓠ</f> For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
7-17 And as for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, doing according to all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my rules,
7-18 then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father, saying, <f>ⓡ</f>‘You shall not lack a man to rule Israel.’
7-19 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “But if you <f>[3]</f> turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them,
7-20 <f>ⓣ</f> then I will pluck you <f>[4]</f> up from my land that I have given you, and this house that I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it <f>ⓤ</f>a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
7-21 And at this house, which was exalted, everyone passing by will be astonished and say, <f>ⓥ</f>‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?’
7-22 Then they will say, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them.’”
60-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Arise, shine, for your light has come, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.</t>
60-2 <t>For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, </t><t>and thick darkness the peoples; </t><t>but the LORD will arise upon you, </t><t>and his glory will be seen upon you.</t>
60-3 <t><f>ⓒ</f> And nations shall come to your light, </t><t>and kings to the brightness of your rising. </t>
60-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> Lift up your eyes all around, and see; </t><t>they all gather together, they come to you; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>your sons shall come from afar, </t><t>and your daughters shall be carried on the hip.</t>
60-5 <t>Then you shall see and <f>ⓕ</f>be radiant; </t><t>your heart shall thrill and exult, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the wealth of the nations shall come to you.</t>
60-6 <t>A multitude of camels shall cover you, </t><t>the young camels of <f>ⓗ</f>Midian and <f>ⓘ</f>Ephah; </t><t>all those from <f>ⓙ</f>Sheba shall come. </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>They shall bring gold and frankincense, </t><t>and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD.</t>
60-7 <t>All the flocks of <f>ⓛ</f>Kedar shall be gathered to you; </t><t>the rams of <f>ⓜ</f>Nebaioth shall minister to you; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and I will beautify my beautiful house. </t>
60-8 <pb/><t>Who are these that fly like a cloud, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>like doves to their windows?</t>
60-9 <t>For <f>ⓠ</f>the coastlands shall hope for me, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>the ships of Tarshish first, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>to bring your children from afar, </t><t>their silver and gold with them, </t><t>for the name of the LORD your God, </t><t>and for the Holy One of Israel, </t><t>because <f>ⓣ</f>he has made you beautiful. </t>
60-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f> Foreigners shall build up your walls, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>their kings shall minister to you; </t><t>for in my wrath I struck you, </t><t>but in my favor I have had mercy on you.</t>
60-11 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Your gates shall be open continually; </t><t>day and night they shall not be shut, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations, </t><t>with their kings led in procession.</t>
60-12 <t><f>ⓨ</f> For the nation and kingdom </t><t>that will not serve you shall perish; </t><t>those nations shall be utterly laid waste.</t>
60-13 <t><f>ⓩ</f> The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, </t><t>the cypress, the plane, and <f>ⓐ</f>the pine, </t><t>to beautify the place of my sanctuary, </t><t>and I will make the place of my feet glorious.</t>
60-14 <t><f>ⓑ</f> The sons of those who afflicted you </t><t>shall come bending low to you, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and all who despised you </t><t>shall bow down at your feet; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>they shall call you the City of the LORD, </t><t>the Zion of the Holy One of Israel. </t>
60-15 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, </t><t>with no one passing through, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>I will make you majestic forever, </t><t>a joy from age to age.</t>
60-16 <t><f>ⓖ</f> You shall suck the milk of nations; </t><t>you shall nurse at the breast of kings; </t><t>and you shall know that <f>ⓗ</f>I, the LORD, am your Savior </t><t>and your Redeemer, <f>ⓘ</f>the Mighty One of Jacob. </t>
60-17 <pb/><t>Instead of bronze I will bring gold, </t><t>and instead of iron I will bring silver; </t><t>instead of wood, bronze, </t><t>instead of stones, iron. </t><t>I will make your overseers peace </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>and your taskmasters righteousness.</t>
60-18 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Violence shall no more be heard in your land, </t><t>devastation or destruction within your borders; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>you shall call your walls Salvation, </t><t>and your gates Praise. </t>
60-19 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> The sun shall be no more </t><t>your light by day, </t><t>nor for brightness shall the moon </t><t>give you light; <f>[2]</f> </t><t>but the LORD will be your everlasting light, </t><t>and your God will be your glory. <f>[3]</f></t>
60-20 <t>Your sun shall no more go down, </t><t>nor your moon withdraw itself; </t><t>for the LORD will be your everlasting light, </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>your days of mourning shall be ended.</t>
60-21 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Your people shall all be righteous; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>they shall possess the land forever, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, </t><t>that I might be glorified. <f>[4]</f></t>
60-22 <t><f>ⓡ</f> The least one shall become a clan, </t><t>and the smallest one a mighty nation; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>I am the LORD; </t><t>in its time I will hasten it. </t>
2-1 <pb/>So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from <f>ⓐ</f>love, any <f>ⓑ</f>participation in the Spirit, any <f>ⓒ</f>affection and sympathy,
2-2 <f>ⓓ</f> complete my joy by being <f>ⓔ</f>of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
2-3 Do nothing from <f>ⓕ</f>selfish ambition or <f>ⓖ</f>conceit, but in <f>ⓗ</f>humility count others more significant than yourselves.
2-4 Let each of you <f>ⓘ</f>look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
2-5 <f>ⓙ</f> Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, <f>[1]</f>
2-6 <f>ⓚ</f> who, though he was in <f>ⓛ</f>the form of God, did not count equality with God <f>ⓜ</f>a thing to be grasped, <f>[2]</f>
2-7 but <f>ⓝ</f>emptied himself, by taking the form of a <f>ⓞ</f>servant, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>being born in the likeness of men.
2-8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by <f>ⓠ</f>becoming obedient to the point of death, <f>ⓡ</f>even death on a cross.
2-9 <f>ⓢ</f> Therefore <f>ⓣ</f>God has <f>ⓤ</f>highly exalted him and bestowed on him <f>ⓥ</f>the name that is above every name,
2-10 so that at the name of Jesus <f>ⓦ</f>every knee should bow, <f>ⓧ</f>in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
2-11 and <f>ⓨ</f>every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is <f>ⓩ</f>Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
2-12 <pb/>Therefore, my beloved, <f>ⓐ</f>as you have always <f>ⓑ</f>obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
2-13 for <f>ⓒ</f>it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for <f>ⓓ</f>his good pleasure.
2-14 <pb/>Do all things <f>ⓔ</f>without grumbling or <f>ⓕ</f>disputing,
2-15 that you may be blameless and innocent, <f>ⓖ</f>children of God <f>ⓗ</f>without blemish <f>ⓘ</f>in the midst of <f>ⓙ</f>a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine <f>ⓚ</f>as lights in the world,
2-16 holding fast to <f>ⓛ</f>the word of life, so that in <f>ⓜ</f>the day of Christ <f>ⓝ</f>I may be proud that <f>ⓞ</f>I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
2-17 Even if I am to be <f>ⓟ</f>poured out as a drink offering upon <f>ⓠ</f>the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.
2-18 Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.
2-19 <pb/>I hope in the Lord Jesus <f>ⓡ</f>to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you.
2-20 For I have no one <f>ⓢ</f>like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.
2-21 For they all <f>ⓣ</f>seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
2-22 But you know Timothy's <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>proven worth, how <f>ⓥ</f>as a son <f>[5]</f> with a father <f>ⓦ</f>he has served with me in the gospel.
2-23 I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me,
2-24 and <f>ⓧ</f>I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.
2-25 <pb/>I have thought it necessary to send to you <f>ⓨ</f>Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and <f>ⓩ</f>fellow soldier, and your messenger and <f>ⓐ</f>minister to my need,
2-26 for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.
2-27 Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
2-28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.
2-29 So <f>ⓑ</f>receive him in the Lord with all joy, and <f>ⓒ</f>honor such men,
2-30 for he nearly died <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>for the work of Christ, risking his life <f>ⓔ</f>to complete what was lacking in your service to me.
