26-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the east of Jeshimon?”
26-2 So Saul arose and went down to <f>ⓑ</f>the wilderness of Ziph with <f>ⓒ</f>three thousand chosen men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
26-3 And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,
26-4 David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed come.
26-5 Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with <f>ⓓ</f>Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying within <f>ⓔ</f>the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.
26-6 <pb/>Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab's brother <f>ⓕ</f>Abishai the son of Zeruiah, <f>ⓖ</f>“Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”
26-7 So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there lay Saul sleeping within <f>ⓗ</f>the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground <f>ⓘ</f>at his head, and Abner and the army lay around him.
26-8 Then Abishai said to David, <f>ⓙ</f>“God has given your enemy into your hand this day. Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice.”
26-9 But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can put out his hand <f>ⓚ</f>against the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?”
26-10 And David said, <f>ⓛ</f>“As the LORD lives, <f>ⓜ</f>the LORD will strike him, or <f>ⓝ</f>his day will come to die, <f>ⓞ</f>or he will go down into battle and perish.
26-11 <f>ⓟ</f> The LORD forbid that I should put out my hand against the LORD's anointed. But take now the spear that is <f>ⓠ</f>at his head and the jar of water, and let us go.”
26-12 So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because <f>ⓡ</f>a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.
26-13 <pb/>Then David went over to the other side and stood far off on the top of the hill, with a great space between them.
26-14 And David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Will you not answer, Abner?” Then Abner answered, “Who are you who calls to the king?”
26-15 And David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.
26-16 This thing that you have done is not good. <f>ⓢ</f>As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is and the jar of water that was <f>ⓣ</f>at his head.”
26-17 <pb/>Saul recognized David's voice and said, <f>ⓤ</f>“Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.”
26-18 And he said, <f>ⓥ</f>“Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What evil is on my hands?
26-19 Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, may he accept an offering, but if it is men, may they be cursed before the LORD, <f>ⓦ</f>for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in <f>ⓧ</f>the heritage of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’
26-20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to seek <f>ⓨ</f>a single flea like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.”
26-21 <pb/>Then Saul said, <f>ⓩ</f>“I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly, and have made a great mistake.”
26-22 And David answered and said, “Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and take it.
26-23 <f>ⓐ</f> The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the LORD gave you into my hand today, and I would not put out my hand against the LORD's anointed.
26-24 Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation.”
26-25 Then Saul said to David, “Blessed be you, my son David! You will do many things and will <f>ⓑ</f>succeed in them.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
149-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Praise the LORD! </t><t>Sing to the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>a new song, </t><t>his praise in <f>ⓒ</f>the assembly of the godly!</t>
149-2 <t>Let Israel <f>ⓓ</f>be glad in <f>ⓔ</f>his Maker; </t><t>let the children of Zion rejoice in their <f>ⓕ</f>King!</t>
149-3 <t>Let them praise his name with <f>ⓖ</f>dancing, </t><t>making melody to him with <f>ⓗ</f>tambourine and <f>ⓘ</f>lyre!</t>
149-4 <t>For the LORD <f>ⓙ</f>takes pleasure in his people; </t><t>he <f>ⓚ</f>adorns the humble with salvation.</t>
149-5 <t>Let the godly exult in glory; </t><t>let them <f>ⓛ</f>sing for joy on their <f>ⓜ</f>beds.</t>
149-6 <t>Let <f>ⓝ</f>the high praises of God be in their throats </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>two-edged swords in their hands,</t>
149-7 <t>to execute vengeance on the nations </t><t>and punishments on the peoples,</t>
149-8 <t>to bind their kings with <f>ⓟ</f>chains </t><t>and their nobles with fetters of iron,</t>
149-9 <t>to execute on them the judgment <f>ⓠ</f>written! </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>This is honor for all his godly ones. </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>Praise the LORD! </t>
19-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> He entered Jericho and was passing through.
19-2 And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich.
19-3 And <f>ⓑ</f>he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was small in stature.
19-4 So he ran on ahead and climbed up into <f>ⓒ</f>a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way.
19-5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, <J>“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for <f>ⓓ</f>I must stay at your house today.”</J>
19-6 So he hurried and came down and <f>ⓔ</f>received him joyfully.
19-7 And when they saw it, they all <f>ⓕ</f>grumbled, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”
19-8 And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods <f>ⓖ</f>I give to the poor. And if I have <f>ⓗ</f>defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it <f>ⓘ</f>fourfold.”
19-9 And Jesus said to him, <J>“Today salvation has come to this house, since <f>ⓙ</f>he also is a son of Abraham.</J>
19-10 <J>For <f>ⓚ</f>the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</J>
19-11 <pb/>As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because <f>ⓛ</f>they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
19-12 He said therefore, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.</J>
19-13 <J>Calling <f>ⓝ</f>ten of his servants, <f>[1]</f> he gave them ten minas, <f>[2]</f> and said to them, ‘Engage in business <f>ⓞ</f>until I come.’</J>
19-14 <J>But <f>ⓟ</f>his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’</J>
19-15 <J>When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.</J>
19-16 <J>The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.’</J>
19-17 <J>And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! <f>[3]</f> Because you have been <f>ⓠ</f>faithful in a very little, <f>ⓡ</f>you shall have authority over ten cities.’</J>
19-18 <J>And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made five minas.’</J>
19-19 <J>And he said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’</J>
19-20 <J>Then another came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in <f>ⓢ</f>a handkerchief;</J>
19-21 <J>for I was afraid of you, because you are <f>ⓣ</f>a severe man. You take <f>ⓤ</f>what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.’</J>
19-22 <J>He said to him, <f>ⓥ</f>‘I will condemn you with your own words, <f>ⓦ</f>you wicked servant! You knew that I was <f>ⓧ</f>a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?</J>
19-23 <J>Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?’</J>
19-24 <J>And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’</J>
19-25 <J>And they said to him, ‘Lord, he has ten minas!’</J>
19-26 <J>‘I tell you that <f>ⓨ</f>to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</J>
19-27 <J>But <f>ⓩ</f>as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and <f>ⓐ</f>slaughter them before me.’”</J>
19-28 <pb/>And when he had said these things, <f>ⓑ</f>he went on ahead, <f>ⓒ</f>going up to Jerusalem.
19-29 <f>ⓓ</f> When he drew near to Bethphage and <f>ⓔ</f>Bethany, at <f>ⓕ</f>the mount that is called Olivet, he sent <f>ⓖ</f>two of the disciples,
19-30 saying, <J>“Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, <f>ⓗ</f>on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.</J>
19-31 <J>If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”</J>
19-32 So those who were sent went away and found it <f>ⓘ</f>just as he had told them.
19-33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”
19-34 And they said, “The Lord has need of it.”
19-35 And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it.
19-36 And as he rode along, they <f>ⓙ</f>spread their cloaks on the road.
19-37 As he was drawing near — already on the way down the Mount of Olives — <f>ⓚ</f>the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice <f>ⓛ</f>for all the mighty works that they had seen,
19-38 saying, <f>ⓜ</f>“Blessed is <f>ⓝ</f>the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and <f>ⓞ</f>glory in the highest!”
19-39 <f>ⓟ</f> And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”
19-40 He answered, <J>“I tell you, if these were silent, <f>ⓠ</f>the very stones would cry out.”</J>
19-41 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And when he drew near and saw the city, <f>ⓢ</f>he wept over it,
19-42 saying, <J> <f>ⓣ</f>“Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now <f>ⓤ</f>they are hidden from your eyes.</J>
19-43 <J>For <f>ⓥ</f>the days will come upon you, when your enemies <f>ⓦ</f>will set up a barricade around you and <f>ⓧ</f>surround you and hem you in on every side</J>
19-44 <J><f>ⓨ</f> and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And <f>ⓩ</f>they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know <f>ⓐ</f>the time of your <f>ⓑ</f>visitation.”</J>
19-45 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,
19-46 saying to them, <J>“It is written, <f>ⓓ</f>‘My house shall be a house of prayer,’ but <f>ⓔ</f>you have made it a den of robbers.”</J>
19-47 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And he was teaching daily in the temple. <f>ⓖ</f>The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him,
19-48 but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were hanging on his words.
