1 Kings 21-1 <pb/>Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in <f>ⓐ</f>Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
1 Kings 21-2 And after this Ahab said to Naboth, <f>ⓑ</f>“Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house, and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.”
1 Kings 21-3 But Naboth said to Ahab, “The LORD forbid <f>ⓒ</f>that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.”
1 Kings 21-4 And Ahab <f>ⓓ</f>went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food.
1 Kings 21-5 <pb/>But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, “Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?”
1 Kings 21-6 And he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ And he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”
1 Kings 21-7 And Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now govern Israel? Arise and eat bread and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
1 Kings 21-8 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to <f>ⓕ</f>the elders and the leaders who lived with Naboth in his city.
1 Kings 21-9 And she wrote in the letters, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.
1 Kings 21-10 And set two <f>ⓖ</f>worthless men opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, <f>ⓗ</f>‘You have cursed <f>[1]</f> God and the king.’ Then take him out and stone him to death.”
1 Kings 21-11 And the men of his city, <f>ⓘ</f>the elders and the leaders who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters that she had sent to them,
1 Kings 21-12 <f>ⓙ</f> they proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.
1 Kings 21-13 And the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him. And the worthless men brought a charge against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king.” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones.
1 Kings 21-14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned; he is dead.”
1 Kings 21-15 <pb/>As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”
1 Kings 21-16 And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1 Kings 21-17 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings 21-18 “Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in <f>ⓛ</f>Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.
1 Kings 21-19 And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Have you killed and also taken possession?”’ And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓜ</f>“In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood.”’”
1 Kings 21-20 <pb/>Ahab said to Elijah, <f>ⓝ</f>“Have you found me, O my enemy?” He answered, “I have found you, because <f>ⓞ</f>you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD.
1 Kings 21-21 Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly burn you up, and <f>ⓟ</f>will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.
1 Kings 21-22 And I will make your house like <f>ⓠ</f>the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like <f>ⓡ</f>the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you <f>ⓢ</f>have made Israel to sin.
1 Kings 21-23 And of Jezebel the LORD also said, <f>ⓣ</f>‘The dogs shall eat Jezebel within <f>ⓤ</f>the walls of Jezreel.’
1 Kings 21-24 <f>ⓥ</f> Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat.”
1 Kings 21-25 <pb/>(<f>ⓦ</f>There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD like Ahab, whom Jezebel his wife incited.
1 Kings 21-26 He acted very abominably in going after <f>ⓧ</f>idols, as <f>ⓨ</f>the Amorites had done, whom the LORD cast out before the people of Israel.)
1 Kings 21-27 <pb/>And when Ahab heard those words, he <f>ⓩ</f>tore his clothes and <f>ⓐ</f>put sackcloth on his flesh and <f>ⓑ</f>fasted and lay in sackcloth and went about dejectedly.
1 Kings 21-28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings 21-29 “Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; <f>ⓒ</f>but in his son's days I will bring the disaster upon his house.”

Acts 24-1 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>after five days the high priest <f>ⓑ</f>Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before <f>ⓒ</f>the governor their case against Paul.
Acts 24-2 And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: <pb/>“Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, <f>ⓓ</f>most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation,
Acts 24-3 in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude.
Acts 24-4 But, to detain <f>[1]</f> you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.
Acts 24-5 For we have found this man a plague, <f>ⓔ</f>one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of <f>ⓕ</f>the sect of the Nazarenes.
Acts 24-6 <f>ⓖ</f> He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. <f>[2]</f>
Acts 24-7 
Acts 24-8 By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him.”
Acts 24-9 <pb/>The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.
Acts 24-10 <pb/>And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied: <pb/>“Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.
Acts 24-11 You can verify that <f>ⓗ</f>it is not more than twelve days since I <f>ⓘ</f>went up <f>ⓙ</f>to worship in Jerusalem,
Acts 24-12 and <f>ⓚ</f>they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city.
Acts 24-13 <f>ⓛ</f> Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me.
Acts 24-14 But this I confess to you, that according to <f>ⓜ</f>the Way, which they call <f>ⓝ</f>a sect, <f>ⓞ</f>I worship <f>ⓟ</f>the God of our fathers, believing everything <f>ⓠ</f>laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,
Acts 24-15 <f>ⓡ</f> having <f>ⓢ</f>a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be <f>ⓣ</f>a resurrection <f>ⓤ</f>of both the just and the unjust.
Acts 24-16 So I always <f>ⓥ</f>take pains to have a <f>ⓦ</f>clear conscience toward both God and man.
Acts 24-17 Now <f>ⓧ</f>after several years <f>ⓨ</f>I came to bring alms to <f>ⓩ</f>my nation and to present <f>ⓐ</f>offerings.
Acts 24-18 While I was doing this, they found me <f>ⓑ</f>purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But <f>ⓒ</f>some Jews from Asia —
Acts 24-19 <f>ⓓ</f> they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me.
Acts 24-20 Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council,
Acts 24-21 other than this one thing <f>ⓔ</f>that I cried out while standing among them: ‘It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.’”
Acts 24-22 <pb/>But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of <f>ⓕ</f>the Way, put them off, saying, “When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.”
Acts 24-23 Then he gave orders to the centurion that he <f>ⓖ</f>should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that <f>ⓗ</f>none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.
Acts 24-24 <pb/>After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about <f>ⓘ</f>faith <f>ⓙ</f>in Christ Jesus.
Acts 24-25 And as he reasoned <f>ⓚ</f>about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, “Go away for the present. <f>ⓛ</f>When I get an opportunity I will summon you.”
Acts 24-26 At the same time he hoped <f>ⓜ</f>that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.
Acts 24-27 When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius <f>ⓝ</f>Festus. And <f>ⓞ</f>desiring to do the Jews a favor, <f>ⓟ</f>Felix left Paul in prison.
