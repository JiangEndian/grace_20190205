Ruth 2-1 <pb/>Now Naomi had <f>ⓐ</f>a relative of her husband's, a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech, whose name was <f>ⓑ</f>Boaz.
Ruth 2-2 And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the field and <f>ⓒ</f>glean among the ears of grain after him <f>ⓓ</f>in whose sight I shall find favor.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”
Ruth 2-3 So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech.
Ruth 2-4 And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem. And he said to the reapers, <f>ⓔ</f>“The LORD be with you!” And they answered, “The LORD bless you.”
Ruth 2-5 Then Boaz said to his young man who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?”
Ruth 2-6 And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, “She is the young Moabite woman, <f>ⓕ</f>who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.
Ruth 2-7 She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.’ So she came, and she has continued from early morning until now, except for a short rest.” <f>[1]</f>
Ruth 2-8 <pb/>Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Now, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women.
Ruth 2-9 Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn.”
Ruth 2-10 Then <f>ⓖ</f>she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should <f>ⓗ</f>take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?”
Ruth 2-11 But Boaz answered her, <f>ⓘ</f>“All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before.
Ruth 2-12 <f>ⓙ</f> The LORD repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!”
Ruth 2-13 Then she said, <f>ⓚ</f>“I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not one of your servants.”
Ruth 2-14 <pb/>And at mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here and eat some bread and dip your morsel in the wine.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her roasted grain. And she ate until <f>ⓛ</f>she was satisfied, and she had some left over.
Ruth 2-15 When she rose to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.
Ruth 2-16 And also pull out some from the bundles for her and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her.”
Ruth 2-17 <pb/>So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah <f>[2]</f> of barley.
Ruth 2-18 And she took it up and went into the city. Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her what food she had left over <f>ⓜ</f>after being satisfied.
Ruth 2-19 And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man <f>ⓝ</f>who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, “The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”
Ruth 2-20 And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, <f>ⓞ</f>“May he be blessed by the LORD, whose kindness has not forsaken <f>ⓟ</f>the living or the dead!” Naomi also said to her, “The man is a close relative of ours, one of <f>ⓠ</f>our redeemers.”
Ruth 2-21 And Ruth the Moabite said, “Besides, he said to me, ‘You shall keep close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’”
Ruth 2-22 And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, lest in another field you be assaulted.”
Ruth 2-23 So she kept close to the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests. And she lived with her mother-in-law.

Mark 7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes <f>ⓑ</f>who had come from Jerusalem,
Mark 7-2 they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were <f>ⓒ</f>defiled, that is, unwashed.
Mark 7-3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, <f>[1]</f> holding to <f>ⓓ</f>the tradition of <f>ⓔ</f>the elders,
Mark 7-4 and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. <f>[2]</f> And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as <f>ⓕ</f>the washing of <f>ⓖ</f>cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches. <f>[3]</f>)
Mark 7-5 And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not walk according to <f>ⓗ</f>the tradition of <f>ⓘ</f>the elders, <f>ⓙ</f>but eat with <f>ⓚ</f>defiled hands?”
Mark 7-6 And he said to them, <J>“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you <f>ⓛ</f>hypocrites, as it is written,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓜ</f>“‘This people honors me with their lips,</J> </t><t><J>but their heart is far from me;</J></t>
Mark 7-7 <t><J>in vain do they worship me,</J> </t><t><J>teaching as <f>ⓝ</f>doctrines the commandments of men.’</J> </t>
Mark 7-8 <pb/><J>You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.”</J>
Mark 7-9 <pb/>And he said to them, <J>“You have a fine way of <f>ⓞ</f>rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition!</J>
Mark 7-10 <J>For Moses said, <f>ⓟ</f>‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.’</J>
Mark 7-11 <J>But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban”’ (that is, given to God) <f>[4]</f> — </J>
Mark 7-12 <J>then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,</J>
Mark 7-13 <J>thus <f>ⓡ</f>making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do.”</J>
Mark 7-14 <pb/>And he called the people to him again and said to them, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“Hear me, all of you, and understand:</J>
Mark 7-15 <J><f>ⓣ</f> There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.” <f>[5]</f></J>
Mark 7-16 
Mark 7-17 And when he had entered <f>ⓤ</f>the house and left the people, <f>ⓥ</f>his disciples asked him about the parable.
Mark 7-18 And he said to them, <J>“Then <f>ⓦ</f>are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him,</J>
Mark 7-19 <J>since it enters not his heart <f>ⓧ</f>but his stomach, and is expelled?” <f>[6]</f></J> (<f>ⓨ</f>Thus he declared all foods clean.)
Mark 7-20 And he said, <J> <f>ⓩ</f>“What comes out of a person is what defiles him.</J>
Mark 7-21 <J>For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, <f>ⓐ</f>murder, adultery,</J>
Mark 7-22 <J>coveting, wickedness, deceit, <f>ⓑ</f>sensuality, <f>ⓒ</f>envy, <f>ⓓ</f>slander, <f>ⓔ</f>pride, <f>ⓕ</f>foolishness.</J>
Mark 7-23 <J><f>ⓖ</f> All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”</J>
Mark 7-24 <pb/>And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. <f>[7]</f> And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden.
Mark 7-25 But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet.
Mark 7-26 <f>ⓗ</f> Now the woman was a <f>ⓘ</f>Gentile, <f>ⓙ</f>a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
Mark 7-27 And he said to her, <J>“Let the children be <f>ⓚ</f>fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and <f>ⓛ</f>throw it to the dogs.”</J>
Mark 7-28 But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's <f>ⓜ</f>crumbs.”
Mark 7-29 And he said to her, <J>“For this statement you may <f>ⓝ</f>go your way; the demon has left your daughter.”</J>
Mark 7-30 And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.
Mark 7-31 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to <f>ⓟ</f>the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the <f>ⓠ</f>Decapolis.
Mark 7-32 And they brought to him <f>ⓡ</f>a man who was deaf and <f>ⓢ</f>had a speech impediment, and they begged him to <f>ⓣ</f>lay his hand on him.
Mark 7-33 And <f>ⓤ</f>taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and <f>ⓥ</f>after spitting touched his tongue.
Mark 7-34 And <f>ⓦ</f>looking up to heaven, <f>ⓧ</f>he sighed and said to him, <J>“Ephphatha,”</J> that is, <J>“Be opened.”</J>
Mark 7-35 <f>ⓨ</f> And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.
Mark 7-36 And <f>ⓩ</f>Jesus <f>[8]</f> charged them to tell no one. But <f>ⓐ</f>the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.
Mark 7-37 And they were <f>ⓑ</f>astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
