36-1 <pb/>“Bezalel and Oholiab and <f>ⓐ</f>every craftsman in whom the LORD has put skill and intelligence to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded.”
36-2 <pb/>And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the LORD had put skill, everyone <f>ⓑ</f>whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work.
36-3 And they received from Moses all the <f>ⓒ</f>contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him <f>ⓓ</f>freewill offerings every morning,
36-4 so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing,
36-5 and said to Moses, <f>ⓔ</f>“The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do.”
36-6 So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, “Let no man or woman do anything more for the <f>ⓕ</f>contribution for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing,
36-7 for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more.
36-8 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked.
36-9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, <f>[1]</f> and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains were the same size.
36-10 <pb/>He <f>[2]</f> coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another.
36-11 He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set. Likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set.
36-12 He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set. The loops were opposite one another.
36-13 And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps. So the tabernacle was a single whole.
36-14 <pb/>He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle. He made eleven curtains.
36-15 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. The eleven curtains were the same size.
36-16 He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
36-17 And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain.
36-18 And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be a single whole.
36-19 And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins.
36-20 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of <f>ⓘ</f>acacia wood.
36-21 Ten cubits was the length of a frame, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each frame.
36-22 Each frame had two tenons for fitting together. He did this for all the frames of the tabernacle.
36-23 The frames for the tabernacle he made thus: twenty frames for the south side.
36-24 And he made forty bases of silver under the twenty frames, two bases under one frame for its two tenons, and two bases under the next frame for its two tenons.
36-25 For the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty frames
36-26 and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one frame and two bases under the next frame.
36-27 For the rear of the tabernacle westward he made six frames.
36-28 He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear.
36-29 And they were separate beneath but joined at the top, at the first ring. He made two of them this way for the two corners.
36-30 There were eight frames with their bases of silver: sixteen bases, under every frame two bases.
36-31 <pb/>He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle,
36-32 and five bars for the frames of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the frames of the tabernacle at the rear westward.
36-33 And he made the middle bar to run from end to end halfway up the frames.
36-34 And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
36-35 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> He made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen; with cherubim skillfully worked into it he made it.
36-36 And for it he made four pillars of acacia and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four bases of silver.
36-37 He also made a screen for the entrance of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, embroidered with needlework,
36-38 and its five pillars with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals, and their fillets were of gold, but their five bases were of bronze.
15-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
15-2 <pb/><t>“Should <f>ⓑ</f>a wise man answer with <f>ⓒ</f>windy knowledge, </t><t>and fill his <f>ⓓ</f>belly with <f>ⓔ</f>the east wind?</t>
15-3 <t>Should he argue in unprofitable talk, </t><t>or in words with which he can do no good?</t>
15-4 <t>But you are doing away with the fear of God <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and hindering meditation before God.</t>
15-5 <t>For your iniquity teaches your mouth, </t><t>and you choose the tongue of the crafty.</t>
15-6 <t>Your <f>ⓕ</f>own mouth condemns you, and not I; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>your own lips testify against you. </t>
15-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> “Are you the first man who was born? </t><t>Or <f>ⓘ</f>were you brought forth <f>ⓙ</f>before the hills?</t>
15-8 <t>Have you listened in <f>ⓚ</f>the council of God? </t><t>And do you limit wisdom to yourself?</t>
15-9 <t><f>ⓛ</f> What do you know that we do not know? </t><t>What do you understand that is not clear to us?</t>
15-10 <t><f>ⓜ</f> Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, </t><t>older than your father.</t>
15-11 <t>Are the comforts of God too small for you, </t><t>or the word that deals gently with you?</t>
15-12 <t>Why does your heart carry you away, </t><t>and why do your eyes flash,</t>
15-13 <t>that you turn your <f>ⓝ</f>spirit against God </t><t>and bring such words out of your mouth?</t>
15-14 <t><f>ⓞ</f> What is man, <f>ⓟ</f>that he can be pure? </t><t>Or he who is <f>ⓠ</f>born of a woman, that he can be righteous?</t>
15-15 <t>Behold, God <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>puts no trust in his <f>ⓢ</f>holy ones, </t><t>and the heavens are not pure in his sight;</t>
15-16 <t><f>ⓣ</f> how much less one who is abominable and <f>ⓤ</f>corrupt, </t><t>a man who <f>ⓥ</f>drinks injustice like water! </t>
15-17 <pb/><t>“I will show you; hear me, </t><t>and what I have seen I will declare</t>
15-18 <t>(what wise men have told, </t><t>without hiding it <f>ⓦ</f>from their fathers,</t>
15-19 <t>to whom alone the land was given, </t><t>and no <f>ⓧ</f>stranger passed among them).</t>
15-20 <t>The wicked man writhes in pain all his days, </t><t>through all the <f>ⓨ</f>years that are laid up for <f>ⓩ</f>the ruthless.</t>
15-21 <t><f>ⓐ</f> Dreadful sounds are in his ears; </t><t>in <f>ⓑ</f>prosperity the destroyer will come upon him.</t>
15-22 <t>He does not believe that he will return out of darkness, </t><t>and he is marked for the sword.</t>
15-23 <t>He <f>ⓒ</f>wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ </t><t>He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand;</t>
15-24 <t>distress and anguish terrify him; </t><t>they <f>ⓓ</f>prevail against him, like a king ready for battle.</t>
15-25 <t>Because he has stretched out his hand against God </t><t>and defies the Almighty,</t>
15-26 <t><f>ⓔ</f> running <f>ⓕ</f>stubbornly against him </t><t>with a thickly bossed shield;</t>
15-27 <t>because he has <f>ⓖ</f>covered his face with his fat </t><t>and gathered fat upon his waist</t>
15-28 <t>and has lived in desolate cities, </t><t>in houses that none should inhabit, </t><t>which were ready to become heaps of ruins;</t>
15-29 <t>he will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure, </t><t>nor will his possessions spread over the earth; <f>[3]</f></t>
15-30 <t>he will not depart from darkness; </t><t>the flame will dry up his shoots, </t><t>and by <f>ⓗ</f>the breath of his mouth he will depart.</t>
15-31 <t>Let him not <f>ⓘ</f>trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, </t><t>for emptiness will be his payment.</t>
15-32 <t>It will be paid in full <f>ⓙ</f>before his time, </t><t>and his branch will not be green.</t>
15-33 <t>He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine, </t><t>and cast off his blossom like the olive tree.</t>
15-34 <t>For <f>ⓚ</f>the company of the godless is barren, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>fire consumes the tents of bribery.</t>
15-35 <t>They <f>ⓜ</f>conceive trouble and give birth to evil, </t><t>and their <f>ⓝ</f>womb prepares deceit.” </t>
14-1 <pb/>Then certain of the <f>ⓐ</f>elders of Israel came to me <f>ⓑ</f>and sat before me.
14-2 And the word of the LORD came to me:
14-3 <f>ⓒ</f> “Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set <f>ⓓ</f>the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. <f>ⓔ</f>Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them?
14-4 Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, <f>ⓕ</f>I the LORD will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols,
14-5 <f>ⓖ</f> that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>who are all estranged from me through their idols.
14-6 <pb/>“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓘ</f>Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
14-7 For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, <f>ⓙ</f>who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to consult me through him, <f>ⓚ</f>I the LORD will answer him myself.
14-8 And <f>ⓛ</f>I will set my face against that man; I <f>ⓜ</f>will make him a sign and a byword <f>ⓝ</f>and cut him off from the midst of my people, <f>ⓞ</f>and you shall know that I am the LORD.
14-9 And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, <f>ⓟ</f>I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
14-10 And they shall bear their punishment <f>[1]</f> — the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike —
14-11 that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, nor <f>ⓠ</f>defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, <f>ⓡ</f>but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord GOD.”
14-12 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
14-13 <f>ⓢ</f> “Son of man, when a land sins against me <f>ⓣ</f>by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it and <f>ⓤ</f>break its supply <f>[2]</f> of bread and send famine upon it, and <f>ⓥ</f>cut off from it man and beast,
14-14 <f>ⓦ</f> even if these three men, <f>ⓧ</f>Noah, <f>ⓨ</f>Daniel, and <f>ⓩ</f>Job, were in it, <f>ⓐ</f>they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, declares the Lord GOD.
14-15 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> “If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, <f>ⓒ</f>and it be made desolate, so that no one may pass through because of the beasts,
14-16 even if these three men were in it, <f>ⓓ</f>as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They alone would be delivered, but <f>ⓔ</f>the land would be desolate.
14-17 <pb/>“Or <f>ⓕ</f>if I bring a sword upon that land and say, Let a sword pass through the land, <f>ⓖ</f>and I cut off from it man and beast,
14-18 <f>ⓗ</f> though these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be delivered.
14-19 <pb/>“Or <f>ⓘ</f>if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast,
14-20 even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness.
14-21 <pb/>“For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more <f>ⓙ</f>when I send upon Jerusalem my four disastrous acts of judgment, <f>ⓚ</f>sword, <f>ⓛ</f>famine, <f>ⓜ</f>wild beasts, and <f>ⓝ</f>pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
14-22 But behold, <f>ⓞ</f>some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out; behold, when they come out to you, and <f>ⓟ</f>you see their ways and their deeds, you will be consoled for the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it.
14-23 They will console you, when you see their ways and their deeds, and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, declares the Lord GOD.”
15-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, <f>ⓑ</f>seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished.
15-2 <pb/>And I saw <f>ⓒ</f>what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire — and also those <f>ⓓ</f>who had conquered the beast and its image and <f>ⓔ</f>the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass <f>ⓕ</f>with harps of God in their hands.
15-3 And they sing <f>ⓖ</f>the song of Moses, <f>ⓗ</f>the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f>“Great and amazing are your deeds, </t><t>O Lord God the Almighty! </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>Just and true are your ways, </t><t>O King of the nations! <f>[1]</f></t>
15-4 <t><f>ⓚ</f> Who will not fear, O Lord, </t><t>and glorify your name? </t><t>For you alone are <f>ⓛ</f>holy. </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>All nations will come </t><t>and worship you, </t><t>for your righteous acts have been revealed.” </t>
15-5 <pb/>After this I looked, and <f>ⓝ</f>the sanctuary of <f>ⓞ</f>the tent <f>[2]</f> of witness in heaven was opened,
15-6 and out of the sanctuary came <f>ⓟ</f>the seven angels with the seven plagues, clothed in pure, bright <f>ⓠ</f>linen, <f>ⓡ</f>with golden sashes around their chests.
15-7 And one of <f>ⓢ</f>the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven <f>ⓣ</f>golden bowls full of the wrath of God <f>ⓤ</f>who lives forever and ever,
15-8 and <f>ⓥ</f>the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and <f>ⓦ</f>no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
