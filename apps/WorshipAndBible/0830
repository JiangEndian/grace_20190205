Deuteronomy 34-1 <pb/>Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab <f>ⓐ</f>to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan,
Deuteronomy 34-2 all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah <f>ⓑ</f>as far as the western sea,
Deuteronomy 34-3 <f>ⓒ</f> the Negeb, and <f>ⓓ</f>the Plain, that is, the Valley of Jericho <f>ⓔ</f>the city of palm trees, as far as <f>ⓕ</f>Zoar.
Deuteronomy 34-4 And the LORD said to him, <f>ⓖ</f>“This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ <f>ⓗ</f>I have let you see it with your eyes, but <f>ⓘ</f>you shall not go over there.”
Deuteronomy 34-5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD,
Deuteronomy 34-6 and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor; but <f>ⓙ</f>no one knows the place of his burial to this day.
Deuteronomy 34-7 <f>ⓚ</f> Moses was 120 years old when he died. <f>ⓛ</f>His eye was undimmed, and his vigor unabated.
Deuteronomy 34-8 And the people of Israel <f>ⓜ</f>wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
Deuteronomy 34-9 <pb/>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of <f>ⓝ</f>the spirit of wisdom, for <f>ⓞ</f>Moses had laid his hands on him. So <f>ⓟ</f>the people of Israel obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Deuteronomy 34-10 And there has not <f>ⓠ</f>arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, <f>ⓡ</f>whom the LORD knew face to face,
Deuteronomy 34-11 none like him for all <f>ⓢ</f>the signs and the wonders that the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land,
Deuteronomy 34-12 and for all the mighty power and all the great deeds of terror that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.

Zechariah 6-1 <pb/>Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of <f>ⓐ</f>bronze.
Zechariah 6-2 The first chariot had <f>ⓑ</f>red horses, the second <f>ⓒ</f>black horses,
Zechariah 6-3 the third <f>ⓓ</f>white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses — all of them strong. <f>[1]</f>
Zechariah 6-4 Then I answered and said to <f>ⓔ</f>the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
Zechariah 6-5 And the angel answered and said to me, <f>ⓕ</f>“These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after <f>ⓖ</f>presenting themselves before <f>ⓗ</f>the Lord of all the earth.
Zechariah 6-6 The chariot with the black horses goes toward <f>ⓘ</f>the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward <f>ⓙ</f>the south country.”
Zechariah 6-7 When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and <f>ⓚ</f>patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, <f>ⓛ</f>patrol the earth.” <f>ⓜ</f>So they patrolled the earth.
Zechariah 6-8 Then he cried to me, “Behold, those who go toward <f>ⓝ</f>the north country have set my Spirit at rest in <f>ⓞ</f>the north country.”
Zechariah 6-9 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Zechariah 6-10 “Take from the exiles <f>ⓟ</f>Heldai, Tobijah, and <f>ⓠ</f>Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of <f>ⓡ</f>Zephaniah.
Zechariah 6-11 Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, <f>ⓢ</f>and set it on the head of <f>ⓣ</f>Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
Zechariah 6-12 And say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, “Behold, the man whose name is <f>ⓤ</f>the Branch: for he shall branch out from his place, and <f>ⓥ</f>he shall build the temple of the LORD.
Zechariah 6-13 <f>ⓦ</f> It is he who shall build the temple of the LORD <f>ⓧ</f>and shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule on his throne. And there <f>[2]</f> shall be a <f>ⓨ</f>priest on his throne, <f>ⓩ</f>and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.”’
Zechariah 6-14 And the crown shall be in the temple of the LORD as <f>ⓐ</f>a reminder to <f>ⓑ</f>Helem, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>Tobijah, <f>ⓓ</f>Jedaiah, and Hen <f>ⓔ</f>the son of Zephaniah.
Zechariah 6-15 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> “And those who are far off shall come and <f>ⓖ</f>help to build the temple of the LORD. <f>ⓗ</f>And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. <f>ⓘ</f>And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.”
