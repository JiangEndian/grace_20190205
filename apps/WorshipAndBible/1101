14-1 <pb/>One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.
14-2 Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave <f>[1]</f> at <f>ⓐ</f>Migron. The people who were with him were about <f>ⓑ</f>six hundred men,
14-3 including <f>ⓒ</f>Ahijah the son of Ahitub, <f>ⓓ</f>Ichabod's brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD <f>ⓔ</f>in Shiloh, <f>ⓕ</f>wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
14-4 Within <f>ⓖ</f>the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
14-5 The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of <f>ⓗ</f>Geba.
14-6 <pb/>Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these <f>ⓘ</f>uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD will work for us, <f>ⓙ</f>for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few.”
14-7 And his armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Do as you wish. <f>[2]</f> Behold, I am with you heart and soul.”
14-8 Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.
14-9 If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.
14-10 But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.”
14-11 So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming <f>ⓚ</f>out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”
14-12 And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.”
14-13 Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him.
14-14 And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre <f>[3]</f> of land.
14-15 And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and even <f>ⓛ</f>the raiders trembled, the earth quaked, and it became a very great panic. <f>[4]</f>
14-16 <pb/>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude <f>ⓜ</f>was dispersing here and there. <f>[5]</f>
14-17 Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count and see who has gone from us.” And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
14-18 So Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God went at that time with the people <f>[6]</f> of Israel.
14-19 Now <f>ⓝ</f>while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”
14-20 Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, <f>ⓞ</f>every Philistine's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.
14-21 Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, <f>ⓟ</f>even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
14-22 Likewise, when all the men of Israel <f>ⓠ</f>who had hidden themselves <f>ⓡ</f>in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle.
14-23 <f>ⓢ</f> So the LORD saved Israel that day. And the battle passed beyond <f>ⓣ</f>Beth-aven.
14-24 <pb/>And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day, <f>ⓤ</f>so Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.” So none of the people had tasted food.
14-25 Now when all the people <f>[7]</f> came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground.
14-26 And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
14-27 But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath, <f>ⓥ</f>so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright.
14-28 Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’” And the people were <f>ⓦ</f>faint.
14-29 Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey.
14-30 How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found. For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great.”
14-31 <pb/>They struck down the Philistines that day from <f>ⓧ</f>Michmash to <f>ⓨ</f>Aijalon. And the people were very <f>ⓩ</f>faint.
14-32 The people <f>ⓐ</f>pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them <f>ⓑ</f>with the blood.
14-33 Then they told Saul, “Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating <f>ⓒ</f>with the blood.” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.” <f>[8]</f>
14-34 And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there.
14-35 And Saul <f>ⓓ</f>built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.
14-36 <pb/>Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But <f>ⓔ</f>the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”
14-37 And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” <f>ⓕ</f>But he did not answer him that day.
14-38 And Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today.
14-39 For <f>ⓖ</f>as the LORD lives who saves Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.
14-40 Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”
14-41 Therefore Saul said, “O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.” <f>[9]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.
14-42 Then Saul said, <f>ⓙ</f>“Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was taken.
14-43 <pb/>Then Saul said to Jonathan, <f>ⓚ</f>“Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, <f>ⓛ</f>“I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die.”
14-44 And Saul said, <f>ⓜ</f>“God do so to me and more also; <f>ⓝ</f>you shall surely die, Jonathan.”
14-45 Then the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! <f>ⓞ</f>As the LORD lives, <f>ⓟ</f>there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die.
14-46 Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
14-47 <pb/>When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, <f>ⓠ</f>against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of <f>ⓡ</f>Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned he routed them.
14-48 And he did valiantly <f>ⓢ</f>and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
14-49 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was <f>ⓤ</f>Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
14-50 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. <f>ⓥ</f>And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, <f>ⓦ</f>Saul's uncle.
14-51 <f>ⓧ</f> Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of <f>ⓨ</f>Abiel.
14-52 <pb/>There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, <f>ⓩ</f>he attached him to himself.
137-1 <pb/><t>By the waters of Babylon, </t><t>there we sat down and wept, </t><t>when we remembered Zion.</t>
137-2 <t>On the willows <f>[1]</f> there </t><t>we hung up our lyres.</t>
137-3 <t>For there our captors </t><t>required of us songs, </t><t>and our tormentors, mirth, saying, </t><t>“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!” </t>
137-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> How shall we sing the LORD's song </t><t>in a foreign land?</t>
137-5 <t>If I forget you, O Jerusalem, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>let my right hand forget its skill!</t>
137-6 <t>Let my <f>ⓒ</f>tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, </t><t>if I do not remember you, </t><t>if I do not set Jerusalem </t><t>above my highest joy! </t>
137-7 <pb/><t>Remember, O LORD, against the <f>ⓓ</f>Edomites </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>the day of Jerusalem, </t><t>how they said, <f>ⓕ</f>“Lay it bare, lay it bare, </t><t>down to its foundations!”</t>
137-8 <t>O daughter of Babylon, <f>ⓖ</f>doomed to be destroyed, </t><t>blessed shall he be who <f>ⓗ</f>repays you </t><t>with what you have done to us!</t>
137-9 <t>Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>dashes them against the rock! </t>
7-1 <pb/>After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, <f>ⓐ</f>he entered Capernaum.
7-2 Now a centurion had a servant <f>[1]</f> who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him.
7-3 When the centurion <f>[2]</f> heard about Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant.
7-4 And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, <f>ⓒ</f>“He is worthy to have you do this for him,
7-5 for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us <f>ⓓ</f>our synagogue.”
7-6 And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, <f>ⓔ</f>do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.
7-7 Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But <f>ⓕ</f>say the word, and let my servant be healed.
7-8 For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
7-9 When Jesus heard these things, <f>ⓖ</f>he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, <J>“I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such <f>ⓗ</f>faith.”</J>
7-10 And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.
7-11 <pb/>Soon afterward <f>[3]</f> he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him.
7-12 As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, <f>ⓘ</f>the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her.
7-13 And when the Lord saw her, <f>ⓙ</f>he had compassion on her and <f>ⓚ</f>said to her, <J>“Do not weep.”</J>
7-14 Then he came up and touched <f>ⓛ</f>the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, <J>“Young man, I say to you, <f>ⓜ</f>arise.”</J>
7-15 And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>gave him to his mother.
7-16 Fear seized them all, and <f>ⓞ</f>they glorified God, saying, <f>ⓟ</f>“A great prophet has arisen among us!” and <f>ⓠ</f>“God has visited his people!”
7-17 And this report about him spread through the whole of Judea and all the surrounding country.
7-18 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> <f>ⓢ</f>The disciples of John reported all these things to him. And John,
7-19 calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one <f>ⓣ</f>who is to come, or <f>ⓤ</f>shall we look for another?”
7-20 And when the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one <f>ⓥ</f>who is to come, or <f>ⓦ</f>shall we look for another?’”
7-21 In that hour <f>ⓧ</f>he healed many people of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and <f>ⓨ</f>on many who were blind he bestowed sight.
7-22 And he answered them, <J>“Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: <f>ⓩ</f>the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, <f>ⓐ</f>lepers <f>[5]</f> are cleansed, and <f>ⓑ</f>the deaf hear, <f>ⓒ</f>the dead are raised up, <f>ⓓ</f>the poor have good news preached to them.</J>
7-23 <J>And blessed is the one who is <f>ⓔ</f>not offended by me.”</J>
7-24 <pb/>When John's messengers had gone, Jesus <f>[6]</f> began to speak to the crowds concerning John: <J>“What did you go out <f>ⓕ</f>into the wilderness to see? <f>ⓖ</f>A reed shaken by the wind?</J>
7-25 <J>What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts.</J>
7-26 <J>What then did you go out to see? <f>ⓗ</f>A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</J>
7-27 <J>This is he of whom it is written,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓘ</f>“‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,</J> </t><t><J>who will prepare your way before you.’</J> </t>
7-28 <pb/><J>I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”</J>
7-29 (<f>ⓙ</f>When all the people heard this, and <f>ⓚ</f>the tax collectors too, they declared God just, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓛ</f>having been baptized with <f>ⓜ</f>the baptism of John,
7-30 <f>ⓝ</f> but the Pharisees and <f>ⓞ</f>the lawyers <f>ⓟ</f>rejected <f>ⓠ</f>the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)
7-31 <pb/><J>“To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?</J>
7-32 <J>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another,</J> <pb/><t><J>“‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;</J> </t><t><J>we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’</J> </t>
7-33 <pb/><J>For John the Baptist has come <f>ⓡ</f>eating no bread and <f>ⓢ</f>drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’</J>
7-34 <J>The Son of Man has come <f>ⓣ</f>eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, <f>ⓤ</f>a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</J>
7-35 <J>Yet <f>ⓥ</f>wisdom is justified by all her children.”</J>
7-36 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at table.
7-37 <f>ⓧ</f> And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,
7-38 and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and <f>ⓨ</f>wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
7-39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If <f>ⓩ</f>this man were <f>ⓐ</f>a prophet, he <f>ⓑ</f>would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.”
7-40 And Jesus answering said to him, <J>“Simon, I have something to say to you.”</J> And he answered, “Say it, Teacher.”
7-41 <pb/><J>“A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred <f>ⓒ</f>denarii, and the other fifty.</J>
7-42 <J><f>ⓓ</f> When they could not pay, he <f>ⓔ</f>cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?”</J>
7-43 Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.” And he said to him, <J>“You have judged rightly.”</J>
7-44 Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, <J>“Do you see this woman? I entered your house; <f>ⓕ</f>you gave me no water for my feet, but <f>ⓖ</f>she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</J>
7-45 <J><f>ⓗ</f> You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to <f>ⓘ</f>kiss my feet.</J>
7-46 <J><f>ⓙ</f> You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</J>
7-47 <J>Therefore I tell you, her sins, <f>ⓚ</f>which are many, are forgiven — for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.”</J>
7-48 And he said to her, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“Your sins are forgiven.”</J>
7-49 Then those who were at table with him began to say among <f>[8]</f> themselves, <f>ⓜ</f>“Who is this, who even forgives sins?”
7-50 And he said to the woman, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“Your faith has saved you; <f>ⓞ</f>go in peace.”</J>
