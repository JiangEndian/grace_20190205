Numbers 10-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Numbers 10-2 “Make two silver trumpets. Of hammered work you shall make them, and you shall use them for <f>ⓐ</f>summoning the congregation and for breaking camp.
Numbers 10-3 And when <f>ⓑ</f>both are blown, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Numbers 10-4 But if they blow only one, then <f>ⓒ</f>the chiefs, the heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.
Numbers 10-5 When you blow an alarm, <f>ⓓ</f>the camps that are on the east side shall set out.
Numbers 10-6 And when you blow an alarm the second time, <f>ⓔ</f>the camps that are on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be blown whenever they are to set out.
Numbers 10-7 But when the assembly is to be gathered together, <f>ⓕ</f>you shall blow a long blast, but you shall not <f>ⓖ</f>sound an alarm.
Numbers 10-8 <f>ⓗ</f> And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. The trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
Numbers 10-9 And <f>ⓘ</f>when you go to war in your land against the adversary who <f>ⓙ</f>oppresses you, then you shall <f>ⓚ</f>sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be <f>ⓛ</f>remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.
Numbers 10-10 <f>ⓜ</f> On the day of your gladness also, and at your appointed feasts and <f>ⓝ</f>at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings. They shall be <f>ⓞ</f>a reminder of you before your God: I am the LORD your God.”
Numbers 10-11 <pb/>In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, <f>ⓟ</f>the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony,
Numbers 10-12 and the people of Israel <f>ⓠ</f>set out by stages from the <f>ⓡ</f>wilderness of Sinai. And the cloud settled down in the <f>ⓢ</f>wilderness of Paran.

Numbers 10-29 <pb/>And Moses said to Hobab the son of <f>ⓟ</f>Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said, <f>ⓠ</f>‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will do good to you, for <f>ⓡ</f>the LORD has promised good to Israel.”
Numbers 10-30 But he said to him, “I will not go. I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.”
Numbers 10-31 And he said, “Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve <f>ⓢ</f>as eyes for us.
Numbers 10-32 And if you do go with us, <f>ⓣ</f>whatever good the LORD will do to us, the same will we do to you.”
Numbers 10-33 <pb/>So they set out from <f>ⓤ</f>the mount of the LORD three days' journey. And the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them three days' journey, to seek out <f>ⓥ</f>a resting place for them.

Daniel 7-1 <pb/>In the first year of <f>ⓐ</f>Belshazzar king of Babylon, <f>ⓑ</f>Daniel saw a dream and <f>ⓒ</f>visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter.
Daniel 7-2 Daniel declared, <f>[1]</f> “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, <f>ⓓ</f>the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
Daniel 7-3 And four great beasts <f>ⓔ</f>came up out of the sea, different from one another.
Daniel 7-4 The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it.
Daniel 7-5 And behold, <f>ⓕ</f>another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’
Daniel 7-6 After this I looked, and behold, another, like a <f>ⓖ</f>leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and <f>ⓗ</f>dominion was given to it.
Daniel 7-7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, <f>ⓘ</f>terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; <f>ⓙ</f>it devoured and broke in pieces <f>ⓚ</f>and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and <f>ⓛ</f>it had ten horns.
Daniel 7-8 I considered the horns, and behold, <f>ⓜ</f>there came up among them another horn, a little one, <f>ⓝ</f>before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and <f>ⓞ</f>a mouth speaking great things.
Daniel 7-9 <pb/>“As I looked, <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f>thrones were placed, </t><t>and the <f>ⓠ</f>Ancient of Days took his seat; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>his clothing was white as snow, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>the hair of his head like pure wool; </t><t>his throne was fiery flames; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>its wheels were burning fire.</t>
Daniel 7-10 <t><f>ⓤ</f> A stream of fire issued </t><t>and came out from before him; </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>a thousand thousands <f>ⓦ</f>served him, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and ten thousand times ten thousand <f>ⓨ</f>stood before him; </t><t>the <f>ⓩ</f>court sat in judgment, </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>the books were opened. </t>
Daniel 7-11 <pb/>“I looked then because of the sound of <f>ⓑ</f>the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, <f>ⓒ</f>the beast was killed, and its body destroyed <f>ⓓ</f>and given over to be burned with fire.
Daniel 7-12 As for the rest of the beasts, <f>ⓔ</f>their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
Daniel 7-13 <pb/>“I saw in the night visions, <pb/><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>behold, with the clouds of heaven </t><t>there came one like a son of man, </t><t>and he came to the <f>ⓖ</f>Ancient of Days </t><t>and was presented before him.</t>
Daniel 7-14 <t><f>ⓗ</f> And to him was given dominion </t><t>and glory and a kingdom, </t><t>that all <f>ⓘ</f>peoples, nations, and languages </t><t>should serve him; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>his dominion is an everlasting dominion, </t><t>which shall not pass away, </t><t>and his kingdom one </t><t>that shall not be destroyed. </t>
Daniel 7-15 <pb/>“As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me <f>[2]</f> was anxious, and <f>ⓚ</f>the visions of my head alarmed me.
Daniel 7-16 I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.
Daniel 7-17 <f>ⓛ</f> ‘These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.
Daniel 7-18 But <f>ⓜ</f>the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.’
Daniel 7-19 <pb/>“Then I desired to know the truth about <f>ⓝ</f>the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet,
Daniel 7-20 <f>ⓞ</f> and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions.
Daniel 7-21 As I looked, this horn <f>ⓟ</f>made war with the saints and prevailed over them,
Daniel 7-22 until the <f>ⓠ</f>Ancient of Days came, and <f>ⓡ</f>judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when <f>ⓢ</f>the saints possessed the kingdom.
Daniel 7-23 <pb/>“Thus he said: ‘As for <f>ⓣ</f>the fourth beast, <pb/><t>there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, </t><t>which shall be different from all the kingdoms, </t><t>and it shall devour the whole earth, </t><t>and trample it down, and break it to pieces.</t>
Daniel 7-24 <t>As for the ten horns, </t><t>out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, </t><t>and another shall arise after them; </t><t>he shall be different from the former ones, </t><t>and shall put down three kings.</t>
Daniel 7-25 <t><f>ⓤ</f> He shall speak words against the Most High, </t><t>and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, </t><t>and shall think to <f>ⓥ</f>change the times and the law; </t><t>and they shall be given into his hand </t><t>for <f>ⓦ</f>a time, times, and half a time.</t>
Daniel 7-26 <t><f>ⓧ</f> But the court shall sit in judgment, </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>his dominion shall be taken away, </t><t>to be consumed and destroyed <f>ⓩ</f>to the end.</t>
Daniel 7-27 <t><f>ⓐ</f> And the kingdom and the dominion </t><t>and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven </t><t>shall be given to the people of <f>ⓑ</f>the saints of the Most High; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, </t><t>and all dominions shall serve and obey him.’ <f>[3]</f> </t>
Daniel 7-28 <pb/>“Here is the end of the matter. <f>ⓓ</f>As for me, Daniel, my <f>ⓔ</f>thoughts greatly alarmed me, <f>ⓕ</f>and my color changed, but <f>ⓖ</f>I kept the matter in my heart.”
