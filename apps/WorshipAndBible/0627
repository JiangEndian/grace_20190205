6-1 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
6-2 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When either a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of <f>ⓐ</f>a Nazirite, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>to separate himself to the LORD,
6-3 he <f>ⓒ</f>shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar made from wine or strong drink and shall not drink any juice of grapes or eat grapes, fresh or dried.
6-4 All the days of his separation <f>[2]</f> he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins.
6-5 <pb/>“All the days of his vow of separation, no <f>ⓓ</f>razor shall touch his head. Until the time is completed for which he separates himself to the LORD, he shall be holy. <f>ⓔ</f>He shall let the locks of hair of his head grow long.
6-6 <pb/>“All the days that he separates himself to the LORD <f>ⓕ</f>he shall not go near a dead body.
6-7 <f>ⓖ</f> Not even for his father or for his mother, for brother or sister, if they die, shall he make himself unclean, because his separation to God is on his head.
6-8 All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.
6-9 <pb/>“And if any man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles his consecrated head, then <f>ⓗ</f>he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.
6-10 <f>ⓘ</f> On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
6-11 and the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead body. And he shall consecrate his head that same day
6-12 and separate himself to the LORD for the days of his separation and bring a male lamb a year old <f>ⓙ</f>for a guilt offering. But the previous period shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
6-13 <pb/>“And this is the law for the Nazirite, <f>ⓚ</f>when the time of his separation has been completed: he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting,
6-14 and he shall bring his gift to the LORD, one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish <f>ⓛ</f>as a sin offering, and one ram without blemish <f>ⓜ</f>as a peace offering,
6-15 and a basket of unleavened bread, <f>ⓝ</f>loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and their <f>ⓞ</f>grain offering and their <f>ⓟ</f>drink offerings.
6-16 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD and offer <f>ⓠ</f>his sin offering and his burnt offering,
6-17 and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offering to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its grain offering and its drink offering.
6-18 And the Nazirite <f>ⓡ</f>shall shave his consecrated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.
6-19 And the priest shall take the <f>ⓢ</f>shoulder of the ram, when it is boiled, and one unleavened loaf out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and <f>ⓣ</f>shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaved the hair of his consecration,
6-20 and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. <f>ⓤ</f>They are a holy portion for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed. And after that the Nazirite may drink wine.
6-21 <pb/>“This is the law of the Nazirite. But if he vows an offering to the LORD above his Nazirite vow, as he can afford, in exact accordance with the vow that he takes, then he shall do in addition to the law of the Nazirite.”
6-22 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
6-23 “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus <f>ⓥ</f>you shall bless the people of Israel: you shall say to them,
6-24 <pb/><t>The LORD <f>ⓦ</f>bless you and <f>ⓧ</f>keep you;</t>
6-25 <t>the LORD <f>ⓨ</f>make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;</t>
6-26 <t>the LORD <f>ⓩ</f>lift up his countenance <f>[3]</f> upon you and give you peace. </t>
6-27 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.”
10-1 <pb/><t>Why, O LORD, do you stand <f>ⓐ</f>far away? </t><t>Why <f>ⓑ</f>do you hide yourself in <f>ⓒ</f>times of trouble? </t>
10-2 <pb/><t>In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; </t><t>let them <f>ⓓ</f>be caught in the schemes that they have devised.</t>
10-3 <t>For the wicked <f>ⓔ</f>boasts of the desires of his soul, </t><t>and the one greedy for gain <f>ⓕ</f>curses <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>renounces the LORD.</t>
10-4 <t>In the pride of his face <f>[2]</f> the wicked does not <f>ⓗ</f>seek him; <f>[3]</f> </t><t>all his thoughts are, <f>ⓘ</f>“There is no God.”</t>
10-5 <t>His ways prosper at all times; </t><t>your judgments are on high, <f>ⓙ</f>out of his sight; </t><t>as for all his foes, he <f>ⓚ</f>puffs at them.</t>
10-6 <t>He <f>ⓛ</f>says in his heart, “I shall not be moved; </t><t>throughout all generations I <f>ⓜ</f>shall not meet adversity.”</t>
10-7 <t><f>ⓝ</f> His mouth is filled with cursing and <f>ⓞ</f>deceit and <f>ⓟ</f>oppression; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>under his tongue are <f>ⓡ</f>mischief and <f>ⓢ</f>iniquity.</t>
10-8 <t>He sits in ambush in the villages; </t><t>in <f>ⓣ</f>hiding places he murders the innocent. </t><t>His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;</t>
10-9 <t>he lurks in ambush like <f>ⓤ</f>a lion in his <f>ⓥ</f>thicket; </t><t>he <f>ⓦ</f>lurks that he may seize the poor; </t><t>he seizes the poor when he draws him into his <f>ⓧ</f>net.</t>
10-10 <t>The helpless are crushed, sink down, </t><t>and fall by his might.</t>
10-11 <t>He says in his heart, “God has forgotten, </t><t>he has <f>ⓨ</f>hidden his face, he <f>ⓩ</f>will never see it.” </t>
10-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Arise, O LORD; O God, <f>ⓑ</f>lift up your hand; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>forget not the afflicted.</t>
10-13 <t>Why does the wicked <f>ⓓ</f>renounce God </t><t>and say in his heart, “You will not <f>ⓔ</f>call to account”?</t>
10-14 <t>But you do see, for you <f>ⓕ</f>note mischief and vexation, </t><t>that you may take it into your hands; </t><t>to you the helpless <f>ⓖ</f>commits himself; </t><t>you have been <f>ⓗ</f>the helper of the fatherless.</t>
10-15 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>call his wickedness to account till you find none. </t>
10-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> The LORD is king forever and ever; </t><t>the <f>ⓛ</f>nations perish from his land.</t>
10-17 <t>O LORD, you hear the desire of the afflicted; </t><t>you will <f>ⓜ</f>strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear</t>
10-18 <t>to <f>ⓝ</f>do justice to the fatherless and <f>ⓞ</f>the oppressed, </t><t>so that <f>ⓟ</f>man who is of the earth may strike terror no more. </t>
3-1 <pb/>King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits <f>[1]</f> and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on <f>ⓐ</f>the plain of Dura, in <f>ⓑ</f>the province of Babylon.
3-2 Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather <f>ⓒ</f>the satraps, the prefects, and <f>ⓓ</f>the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
3-3 Then <f>ⓔ</f>the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
3-4 And the herald <f>ⓕ</f>proclaimed aloud, “You are commanded, O <f>ⓖ</f>peoples, nations, and languages,
3-5 that when you hear the <f>ⓗ</f>sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you <f>ⓘ</f>are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
3-6 And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately <f>ⓙ</f>be cast into a burning fiery furnace.”
3-7 Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all <f>ⓚ</f>the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
3-8 <pb/>Therefore at that time certain <f>ⓛ</f>Chaldeans <f>ⓜ</f>came forward and maliciously accused the Jews.
3-9 They declared <f>[2]</f> to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!
3-10 You, O king, <f>ⓝ</f>have made a decree, that every man who <f>ⓞ</f>hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, <f>ⓟ</f>shall fall down and worship the golden image.
3-11 And whoever does not fall down and worship <f>ⓠ</f>shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace.
3-12 There are certain Jews whom you have <f>ⓡ</f>appointed over the affairs of <f>ⓢ</f>the province of Babylon: <f>ⓣ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, <f>ⓤ</f>pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.”
3-13 <pb/>Then Nebuchadnezzar <f>ⓥ</f>in furious rage commanded that <f>ⓦ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king.
3-14 Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, “Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?
3-15 Now if you are ready when <f>ⓧ</f>you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, well and good. <f>[3]</f> But if you do not worship, <f>ⓨ</f>you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And <f>ⓩ</f>who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?”
3-16 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
3-17 If this be so, <f>ⓑ</f>our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. <f>[4]</f>
3-18 But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.”
3-19 <pb/>Then Nebuchadnezzar was <f>ⓒ</f>filled with fury, and the expression of his face <f>ⓓ</f>was changed against <f>ⓔ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated.
3-20 And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army <f>ⓕ</f>to bind <f>ⓖ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
3-21 Then these men were <f>ⓗ</f>bound in their cloaks, their tunics, <f>[5]</f> their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace.
3-22 Because the king's order was <f>ⓘ</f>urgent and the furnace overheated, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up <f>ⓙ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
3-23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell <f>ⓚ</f>bound into the burning fiery furnace.
3-24 <pb/>Then King Nebuchadnezzar was <f>ⓛ</f>astonished and rose up <f>ⓜ</f>in haste. He declared to his <f>ⓝ</f>counselors, “Did we not cast three men <f>ⓞ</f>bound into the fire?” They answered and said to the king, “True, O king.”
3-25 He answered and said, “But I see four men unbound, <f>ⓟ</f>walking in the midst of the fire, and they <f>ⓠ</f>are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like <f>ⓡ</f>a son of the gods.”
3-26 <pb/>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace; he declared, <f>ⓢ</f>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the <f>ⓣ</f>Most High God, come out, and come here!” Then <f>ⓤ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.
3-27 And the <f>ⓥ</f>satraps, the prefects, the governors, and <f>ⓦ</f>the king's counselors gathered together and saw that <f>ⓧ</f>the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men. The hair of their heads was not singed, their <f>ⓨ</f>cloaks were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them.
3-28 Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, “Blessed be the God of <f>ⓩ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who <f>ⓐ</f>has sent his angel and <f>ⓑ</f>delivered his servants, who <f>ⓒ</f>trusted in him, and set aside <f>[6]</f> the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than <f>ⓓ</f>serve and worship any god except their own God.
3-29 Therefore <f>ⓔ</f>I make a decree: Any <f>ⓕ</f>people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of <f>ⓖ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego <f>ⓗ</f>shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way.”
3-30 Then the king promoted <f>ⓘ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in <f>ⓙ</f>the province of Babylon.
