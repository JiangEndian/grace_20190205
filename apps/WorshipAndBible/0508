2-1 <pb/>Again <f>ⓐ</f>there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.
2-2 And the LORD said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Satan answered the LORD and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.”
2-3 And the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still <f>ⓑ</f>holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him <f>ⓒ</f>without reason.”
2-4 Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.
2-5 But <f>ⓓ</f>stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will <f>ⓔ</f>curse you to your face.”
2-6 And the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.”
2-7 <pb/>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with loathsome <f>ⓕ</f>sores from <f>ⓖ</f>the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
2-8 And he took <f>ⓗ</f>a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in <f>ⓘ</f>the ashes.
2-9 <pb/>Then his wife said to him, “Do you still <f>ⓙ</f>hold fast your integrity? <f>ⓚ</f>Curse God and die.”
2-10 But he said to her, “You speak as one of the <f>ⓛ</f>foolish women would speak. <f>ⓜ</f>Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?” <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>In all this Job did not <f>ⓞ</f>sin with his lips.
2-11 <pb/>Now when Job's three <f>ⓟ</f>friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz <f>ⓠ</f>the Temanite, Bildad <f>ⓡ</f>the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to <f>ⓢ</f>show him sympathy and comfort him.
2-12 And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they <f>ⓣ</f>tore their robes and sprinkled <f>ⓤ</f>dust on their heads toward heaven.
2-13 And they sat with him on the ground <f>ⓥ</f>seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.
1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by <f>ⓑ</f>the Chebar canal, <f>ⓒ</f>the heavens were opened, and I saw <f>ⓓ</f>visions of God. <f>[1]</f>
1-2 On the fifth day of the month (it was <f>ⓔ</f>the fifth year of <f>ⓕ</f>the exile of King Jehoiachin),
1-3 the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel <f>ⓖ</f>the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by <f>ⓗ</f>the Chebar canal, and <f>ⓘ</f>the hand of the LORD was upon him there.
1-4 <pb/>As I looked, behold, <f>ⓙ</f>a stormy wind came <f>ⓚ</f>out of the north, and a great cloud, with <f>ⓛ</f>brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, <f>ⓜ</f>as it were gleaming metal. <f>[2]</f>
1-5 And from the midst of it came the likeness of <f>ⓝ</f>four living creatures. <f>ⓞ</f>And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness,
1-6 <f>ⓟ</f> but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.
1-7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled <f>ⓠ</f>like burnished bronze.
1-8 Under their wings <f>ⓡ</f>on their four sides <f>ⓢ</f>they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
1-9 their wings touched one another. <f>ⓣ</f>Each one of them went straight forward, <f>ⓤ</f>without turning as they went.
1-10 As for the likeness of their faces, <f>ⓥ</f>each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle.
1-11 Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while <f>ⓦ</f>two covered their bodies.
1-12 <f>ⓧ</f> And each went straight forward. <f>ⓨ</f>Wherever the spirit <f>[3]</f> would go, they went, without turning as they went.
1-13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was <f>ⓩ</f>like burning coals of fire, <f>ⓐ</f>like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. <f>ⓑ</f>And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
1-14 And the living creatures <f>ⓒ</f>darted to and fro, <f>ⓓ</f>like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
1-15 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. <f>[4]</f>
1-16 <f>ⓕ</f> As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like <f>ⓖ</f>the gleaming of beryl. <f>ⓗ</f>And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel.
1-17 <f>ⓘ</f> When they went, they went <f>ⓙ</f>in any of their four directions <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>without turning as they went.
1-18 And their rims were tall and awesome, <f>ⓛ</f>and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
1-19 <f>ⓜ</f> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; <f>ⓝ</f>and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
1-20 <f>ⓞ</f> Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, <f>ⓟ</f>for the spirit of the living creatures <f>[6]</f> was in the wheels.
1-21 <f>ⓠ</f> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; <f>ⓡ</f>and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, <f>ⓢ</f>for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
1-22 <pb/>Over the heads of the living creatures there was <f>ⓣ</f>the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring <f>ⓤ</f>crystal, spread out above their heads.
1-23 And under the expanse their wings were <f>ⓥ</f>stretched out straight, one toward another. <f>ⓦ</f>And each creature had two wings covering its body.
1-24 And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings <f>ⓧ</f>like the sound of many waters, like <f>ⓨ</f>the sound of the <f>ⓩ</f>Almighty, a sound of tumult <f>ⓐ</f>like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
1-25 And there came a voice from above <f>ⓑ</f>the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
1-26 <pb/>And above the expanse over their heads there was <f>ⓒ</f>the likeness of a throne, <f>ⓓ</f>in appearance <f>ⓔ</f>like sapphire; <f>[7]</f> and seated above the likeness of a throne was <f>ⓕ</f>a likeness with a human appearance.
1-27 And <f>ⓖ</f>upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were <f>ⓗ</f>gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and <f>ⓘ</f>there was brightness around him. <f>[8]</f>
1-28 Like the appearance of <f>ⓙ</f>the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. <pb/>Such was the appearance of the likeness of <f>ⓚ</f>the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, <f>ⓛ</f>I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
2-1 <pb/><J>“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‘The words of <f>ⓐ</f>him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, <f>ⓑ</f>who walks among the seven golden lampstands.</J>

2-5 <J>Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do <f>ⓘ</f>the works you did at first. If not, <f>ⓙ</f>I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.</J>
