8-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Let my people go, that <f>ⓐ</f>they may serve me.
8-2 But if you <f>ⓑ</f>refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your country with <f>ⓒ</f>frogs.
8-3 The Nile shall swarm with frogs that shall come up into your house and into <f>ⓓ</f>your bedroom and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people, <f>[2]</f> and into your ovens and your kneading bowls.
8-4 The frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your servants.”’”
8-5 <f>[3]</f> And the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, <f>ⓔ</f>‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt!’”
8-6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and <f>ⓕ</f>the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
8-7 But <f>ⓖ</f>the magicians did the same by their secret arts and made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
8-8 <pb/>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Plead with the LORD to take away the frogs from me and from my people, and <f>ⓘ</f>I will let the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.”
8-9 Moses said to Pharaoh, “Be pleased to command me when <f>ⓙ</f>I am to plead for you and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs be cut off from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile.”
8-10 And he said, “Tomorrow.” Moses said, “Be it as you say, so <f>ⓚ</f>that you may know that <f>ⓛ</f>there is no one like the LORD our God.
8-11 The frogs shall go away from you and your houses and your servants and your people. They shall be left only in the Nile.”
8-12 So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD about the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh. <f>[4]</f>
8-13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses. The frogs died out in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields.
8-14 And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
8-15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a <f>ⓜ</f>respite, he <f>ⓝ</f>hardened his heart and would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
8-16 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth, so that it may become gnats in all the land of Egypt.’”
8-17 And they did so. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and <f>ⓟ</f>there were gnats on man and beast. All the dust of the earth became gnats in all the land of Egypt.
8-18 The <f>ⓠ</f>magicians tried by their secret arts to produce gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.
8-19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is <f>ⓡ</f>the finger of God.” But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, as the LORD had said.
8-20 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓢ</f>“Rise up early in the morning and present yourself to Pharaoh, as he goes out to the water, and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, <f>ⓣ</f>“Let my people go, that they may serve me.
8-21 Or else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they stand.
8-22 But on that day <f>ⓤ</f>I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there, <f>ⓥ</f>that you may know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. <f>[5]</f>
8-23 Thus I will put a division <f>[6]</f> between my people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall happen.”’”
8-24 And the LORD did so. <f>ⓦ</f>There came great swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses. Throughout all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by the swarms of flies.
8-25 <pb/>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.”
8-26 But Moses said, “It would not be right to do so, for the offerings we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God are an <f>ⓧ</f>abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice offerings <f>ⓨ</f>abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?
8-27 We must go <f>ⓩ</f>three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God <f>ⓐ</f>as he tells us.”
8-28 So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you must not go very far away. <f>ⓑ</f>Plead for me.”
8-29 Then Moses said, “Behold, I am going out from you and I will plead with the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow. Only let not Pharaoh <f>ⓒ</f>cheat again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.”
8-30 So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
8-31 And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained.
8-32 But Pharaoh <f>ⓓ</f>hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the people go.

10-30 <f>ⓜ</f> We will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land or take their daughters for our sons.
10-31 <f>ⓝ</f> And if the peoples of the land bring in goods or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day. And we will forego the crops of the <f>ⓞ</f>seventh year and the <f>ⓟ</f>exaction of every debt.
10-32 <pb/>“We also take on ourselves the obligation to give yearly <f>ⓠ</f>a third part of a shekel <f>[3]</f> for the service of the house of our God:
10-33 <f>ⓡ</f> for the showbread, <f>ⓢ</f>the regular grain offering, <f>ⓣ</f>the regular burnt offering, the Sabbaths, the new moons, the appointed feasts, the holy things, and the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
10-34 <f>ⓤ</f> We, the priests, the Levites, and the people, have likewise cast lots <f>ⓥ</f>for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers' houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, <f>ⓦ</f>as it is written in the Law.
10-35 We obligate ourselves <f>ⓧ</f>to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of every tree, year by year, to the house of the LORD;
10-36 also to bring to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God, the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, <f>ⓨ</f>as it is written in the Law, and the firstborn of our herds and of our flocks;

10-38 And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive the tithes. And the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the chambers of <f>ⓑ</f>the storehouse.
10-39 For the people of Israel and the sons of Levi <f>ⓒ</f>shall bring the contribution of grain, wine, and oil to the chambers, where the vessels of the sanctuary are, as well as the priests who minister, and the gatekeepers and the singers. <f>ⓓ</f>We will not neglect the house of our God.”
43-1 <pb/>When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the LORD their God, with which the LORD their God had sent him to them,
43-2 Azariah the son of <f>ⓐ</f>Hoshaiah and <f>ⓑ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓒ</f>all the insolent men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie. The LORD our God did not send you to say, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Do not go to Egypt to live there,’
43-3 but <f>ⓔ</f>Baruch the son of Neriah <f>ⓕ</f>has set you against us, <f>ⓖ</f>to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.”
43-4 So <f>ⓗ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and all <f>ⓘ</f>the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the LORD, to remain in the land of Judah.
43-5 But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took <f>ⓙ</f>all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven —
43-6 <f>ⓚ</f> the men, the women, the children, <f>ⓛ</f>the princesses, and every person whom <f>ⓜ</f>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with <f>ⓝ</f>Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah.
43-7 And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. And they arrived at <f>ⓞ</f>Tahpanhes.
43-8 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in <f>ⓟ</f>Tahpanhes:
43-9 “Take in your hands large stones and hide them in the mortar in the pavement that is at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in <f>ⓠ</f>Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah,
43-10 and say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, <f>ⓡ</f>my servant, <f>ⓢ</f>and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden, and he will spread his royal canopy over them.
43-11 He shall come <f>ⓣ</f>and strike the land of Egypt, <f>ⓤ</f>giving over to the pestilence those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword.
43-12 <f>ⓥ</f> I shall kindle a fire <f>ⓦ</f>in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them <f>ⓧ</f>and carry them away captive. <f>ⓨ</f>And he shall clean the land of Egypt <f>ⓩ</f>as a shepherd cleans his cloak of vermin, and he shall go away from there in peace.
43-13 He shall break the <f>ⓐ</f>obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt, <f>ⓑ</f>and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.’”
3-1 <pb/>Likewise, wives, <f>ⓐ</f>be subject to your own husbands, so that <f>ⓑ</f>even if some do not obey the word, <f>ⓒ</f>they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives,
3-2 when they see your <f>ⓓ</f>respectful and pure conduct.
3-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Do not let your adorning be external — the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear —
3-4 but let your adorning be <f>ⓕ</f>the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious.
3-5 For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands,
3-6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, <f>ⓖ</f>calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and <f>ⓗ</f>do not fear anything that is frightening.
3-7 <pb/>Likewise, <f>ⓘ</f>husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker <f>ⓙ</f>vessel, since they are heirs with you <f>[1]</f> of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
3-8 <pb/>Finally, all of you, <f>ⓚ</f>have unity of mind, sympathy, <f>ⓛ</f>brotherly love, <f>ⓜ</f>a tender heart, and <f>ⓝ</f>a humble mind.
3-9 <f>ⓞ</f> Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, <f>ⓟ</f>bless, for <f>ⓠ</f>to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.
3-10 For <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f>“Whoever desires to love life </t><t>and see good days, </t><t>let him keep his tongue from evil </t><t>and his lips from speaking deceit;</t>
3-11 <t>let him turn away from evil and do good; </t><t>let him seek peace and pursue it.</t>
3-12 <t>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, </t><t>and his ears are open to their prayer. </t><t>But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.” </t>
3-13 <pb/>Now <f>ⓢ</f>who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
3-14 <f>ⓣ</f> But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. <f>ⓤ</f>Have no fear of them, <f>ⓥ</f>nor be troubled,
3-15 but <f>ⓦ</f>in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, <f>ⓧ</f>always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and <f>ⓨ</f>respect,
3-16 <f>ⓩ</f> having a good conscience, so that, <f>ⓐ</f>when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
3-17 For <f>ⓑ</f>it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.
3-18 <pb/>For Christ also <f>ⓒ</f>suffered <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, <f>ⓔ</f>that he might bring us to God, being put to death <f>ⓕ</f>in the flesh but made alive <f>ⓖ</f>in the spirit,
3-19 in which <f>[3]</f> he went and <f>ⓗ</f>proclaimed <f>[4]</f> to the spirits in prison,
3-20 because <f>[5]</f> they formerly did not obey, <f>ⓘ</f>when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, <f>ⓙ</f>while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, <f>ⓚ</f>eight persons, were brought safely through water.
3-21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, <f>ⓛ</f>now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but <f>ⓜ</f>as an appeal to God for a good conscience, <f>ⓝ</f>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
3-22 who has gone into heaven and <f>ⓞ</f>is at the right hand of God, <f>ⓟ</f>with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
