13-1 <pb/>Now Joshua <f>ⓐ</f>was old and advanced in years, and the LORD said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and there remains yet very much land <f>ⓑ</f>to possess.
13-2 <f>ⓒ</f> This is the land that yet remains: all the <f>ⓓ</f>regions of the Philistines, and all those of the Geshurites
13-3 (from the <f>ⓔ</f>Shihor, which is east of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron, it is counted as Canaanite; <f>ⓕ</f>there are five rulers of the Philistines, those of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron), and those of <f>ⓖ</f>the Avvim,
13-4 in the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the boundary of <f>ⓗ</f>the Amorites,
13-5 and the land of the <f>ⓘ</f>Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from <f>ⓙ</f>Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to <f>ⓚ</f>Lebo-hamath,
13-6 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to <f>ⓛ</f>Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians. I myself will drive <f>ⓜ</f>them out from before the people of Israel. Only <f>ⓝ</f>allot the land to Israel <f>ⓞ</f>for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
13-7 Now therefore <f>ⓟ</f>divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh.”
13-8 <pb/>With the other half of the tribe of Manasseh <f>[1]</f> the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, <f>ⓠ</f>which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them:
13-9 <f>ⓡ</f> from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and <f>ⓢ</f>all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon;
13-10 <f>ⓣ</f> and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the boundary of the Ammonites;
13-11 and Gilead, and the <f>ⓤ</f>region of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and <f>ⓥ</f>all Bashan to Salecah;
13-12 <f>ⓦ</f> all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone was left of <f>ⓧ</f>the remnant of the Rephaim); <f>ⓨ</f>these Moses had struck and driven out.
13-13 <f>ⓩ</f> Yet the people of Israel did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites, but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.
13-14 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> To the tribe of Levi alone Moses gave no inheritance. The offerings by fire to the LORD God of Israel are their inheritance, as he said to him.
13-15 <pb/>And Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the people of Reuben according to their clans.
13-16 So their territory was from Aroer, <f>ⓑ</f>which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by <f>ⓒ</f>Medeba;
13-17 with Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the tableland; <f>ⓓ</f>Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
13-18 <f>ⓔ</f> and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
13-19 and <f>ⓕ</f>Kiriathaim, and <f>ⓖ</f>Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,
13-20 and <f>ⓗ</f>Beth-peor, and <f>ⓘ</f>the slopes of Pisgah, and <f>ⓙ</f>Beth-jeshimoth,
13-21 that is, <f>ⓚ</f>all the cities of the tableland, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, <f>ⓛ</f>whom Moses defeated with <f>ⓜ</f>the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
13-22 <f>ⓝ</f> Balaam also, the son of Beor, the one who practiced divination, was killed with the sword by the people of Israel among the rest of their slain.
13-23 And the border of the people of Reuben was the Jordan as a boundary. This was the inheritance of the people of Reuben, according to their clans with their cities and villages.
13-24 <pb/>Moses gave an inheritance also to the tribe of Gad, to the people of Gad, according to their clans.
13-25 <f>ⓞ</f> Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites, to Aroer, which is east of <f>ⓟ</f>Rabbah,
13-26 and from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from <f>ⓠ</f>Mahanaim to the territory of Debir, <f>[2]</f>
13-27 and in the valley Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, <f>ⓡ</f>Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, having the Jordan as a boundary, to the lower end of the Sea of <f>ⓢ</f>Chinnereth, eastward beyond the Jordan.
13-28 This is the inheritance of the people of Gad according to their clans, with their cities and villages.
13-29 <pb/>And Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was allotted to the half-tribe of the people of Manasseh according to their clans.
13-30 Their region extended from <f>ⓣ</f>Mahanaim, through all Bashan, the whole kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all <f>ⓤ</f>the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities,
13-31 and half Gilead, and <f>ⓥ</f>Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. These were allotted to the people of <f>ⓦ</f>Machir the son of Manasseh for the half of the people of Machir according to their clans.
13-32 <pb/>These are the inheritances that Moses distributed <f>ⓧ</f>in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.
13-33 <f>ⓨ</f> But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance; the LORD God of Israel is their inheritance, <f>ⓩ</f>just as he said to them.

1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, <f>ⓑ</f>the son of David, <f>ⓒ</f>the son of Abraham.
1-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Abraham was the father of Isaac, and <f>ⓔ</f>Isaac the father of Jacob, and <f>ⓕ</f>Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
1-3 and <f>ⓖ</f>Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram, <f>[1]</f>
1-4 and Ram the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,
1-5 and Salmon the father of Boaz by <f>ⓗ</f>Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,
1-6 and <f>ⓘ</f>Jesse the father of David the king. <pb/>And <f>ⓙ</f>David was the father of Solomon by <f>ⓚ</f>the wife of Uriah,
1-7 and <f>ⓛ</f>Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, <f>[2]</f>
1-8 and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, <f>ⓜ</f>and Joram the father of Uzziah,
1-9 and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
1-10 and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, <f>[3]</f> and Amos the father of Josiah,
1-11 and <f>ⓝ</f>Josiah the father of <f>ⓞ</f>Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
1-12 <pb/>And after the deportation to Babylon: <f>ⓟ</f>Jechoniah was the father of <f>ⓠ</f>Shealtiel, <f>[4]</f> and <f>ⓡ</f>Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
1-13 and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,
1-14 and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,
1-15 and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,
1-16 and Jacob the father of <f>ⓢ</f>Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.
1-17 <pb/>So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to <f>ⓣ</f>the Christ fourteen generations.
1-18 <pb/>Now the birth of <f>ⓤ</f>Jesus Christ <f>[5]</f> took place in this way. <f>ⓥ</f>When his mother Mary had been betrothed <f>[6]</f> to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child <f>ⓦ</f>from the Holy Spirit.
1-19 And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling <f>ⓧ</f>to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.
1-20 But as he considered these things, behold, <f>ⓨ</f>an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
1-21 She will bear a son, and <f>ⓩ</f>you shall call his name Jesus, <f>ⓐ</f>for he will save his people from their sins.”
1-22 <f>ⓑ</f> All this took place <f>ⓒ</f>to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
1-23 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, </t><t>and they shall call his name <f>ⓔ</f>Immanuel” </t> <pb/>(which means, God <f>ⓕ</f>with us).
1-24 When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife,
1-25 but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And <f>ⓖ</f>he called his name Jesus.
