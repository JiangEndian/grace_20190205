39-1 <pb/>From the <f>ⓐ</f>blue and purple and scarlet yarns they made <f>ⓑ</f>finely woven garments, <f>[1]</f> for ministering in the Holy Place. They made the holy garments for Aaron, <f>ⓒ</f>as the LORD had commanded Moses.
39-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> He made the ephod of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen.
39-3 And they hammered out gold leaf, and he cut it into threads to work into the blue and purple and the scarlet yarns, and into the fine twined linen, in skilled design.
39-4 They made for the ephod attaching shoulder pieces, joined to it at its two edges.
39-5 And the skillfully woven band on it was of one piece with it and made like it, of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
39-6 <pb/>They made the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold filigree, and engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel.
39-7 And he set them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod to be stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
39-8 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> He made the breastpiece, in skilled work, in the style of the ephod, of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen.
39-9 It was square. They made the breastpiece doubled, a span <f>[2]</f> its length and a span its breadth when doubled.
39-10 And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row;
39-11 and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;
39-12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
39-13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in settings of gold filigree.
39-14 There were twelve stones with their names according to the names of the sons of Israel. They were like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes.
39-15 And they made on the breastpiece twisted chains like cords, of pure gold.
39-16 And they made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece.
39-17 And they put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the edges of the breastpiece.
39-18 They attached the two ends of the two cords to the two settings of filigree. Thus they attached it in front to the shoulder pieces of the ephod.
39-19 Then they made two rings of gold, and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod.
39-20 And they made two rings of gold, and attached them in front to the lower part of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, at its seam above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
39-21 And they bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, so that it should lie on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece should not come loose from the ephod, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
39-22 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> He also made the robe of the ephod woven all of blue,
39-23 and the opening of the robe in it was like the opening in a garment, with a binding around the opening, so that it might not tear.
39-24 On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen.
39-25 They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around the hem of the robe, between the pomegranates —
39-26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate around the hem of the robe for ministering, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
39-27 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> They also made the coats, woven of fine <f>ⓗ</f>linen, for Aaron and his sons,
39-28 and the <f>ⓘ</f>turban of fine linen, and the caps of fine linen, and the linen undergarments of fine twined linen,
39-29 and the sash of fine twined linen and of blue and purple and scarlet yarns, embroidered with needlework, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
39-30 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription, like the engraving of a signet, “Holy to the LORD.”
39-31 And they tied to it a cord of blue to fasten it on the turban above, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
39-32 <pb/>Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished, and the people of Israel did <f>ⓚ</f>according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.
39-33 Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its utensils, its hooks, its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;
39-34 the covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins, and the <f>ⓛ</f>veil of the screen;
39-35 the ark of the testimony with its poles and the mercy seat;
39-36 the table with all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;
39-37 <f>ⓜ</f> the lampstand of pure gold and its lamps with the lamps set and all its utensils, and the oil for the light;
39-38 <f>ⓝ</f> the golden altar, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and <f>ⓞ</f>the screen for the entrance of the tent;
39-39 the bronze altar, and its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin and its stand;
39-40 <f>ⓟ</f> the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its bases, and the <f>ⓠ</f>screen for the gate of the court, its <f>ⓡ</f>cords, and its pegs; and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
39-41 the finely worked garments for ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons for their service as priests.
39-42 <f>ⓢ</f> According to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the people of Israel had done all the work.
39-43 And Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it; as the LORD had commanded, so had they done it. Then Moses <f>ⓣ</f>blessed them.
18-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
18-2 <pb/><t>“How long will you <f>ⓑ</f>hunt for words? </t><t>Consider, and then we will speak.</t>
18-3 <t>Why are we counted as <f>ⓒ</f>cattle? </t><t>Why are we stupid in your sight?</t>
18-4 <t>You who <f>ⓓ</f>tear yourself in your anger, </t><t>shall the earth be forsaken for you, </t><t>or <f>ⓔ</f>the rock be removed out of its place? </t>
18-5 <pb/><t>“Indeed, <f>ⓕ</f>the light of the wicked is put out, </t><t>and the flame of his fire does not shine.</t>
18-6 <t>The light is <f>ⓖ</f>dark in his tent, </t><t>and his lamp above him is put out.</t>
18-7 <t>His strong steps are shortened, </t><t>and his <f>ⓗ</f>own schemes throw him down.</t>
18-8 <t>For he is cast into a net by his own feet, </t><t>and he walks on its mesh.</t>
18-9 <t><f>ⓘ</f> A trap seizes him by the heel; </t><t>a snare lays hold of him.</t>
18-10 <t>A rope is hidden for him in the ground, </t><t>a trap for him in the path.</t>
18-11 <t><f>ⓙ</f> Terrors frighten him on every side, </t><t>and chase him at his heels.</t>
18-12 <t>His strength is famished, </t><t>and calamity is <f>ⓚ</f>ready for his stumbling.</t>
18-13 <t>It consumes the parts of his skin; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>the firstborn of death consumes his limbs.</t>
18-14 <t>He is torn from the tent in which he trusted </t><t>and is brought to <f>ⓜ</f>the king of terrors.</t>
18-15 <t>In his tent dwells that which is none of his; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>sulfur is scattered over his habitation.</t>
18-16 <t>His <f>ⓞ</f>roots dry up beneath, </t><t>and his branches <f>ⓟ</f>wither above.</t>
18-17 <t>His <f>ⓠ</f>memory perishes from the earth, </t><t>and he has no name in the street.</t>
18-18 <t><f>ⓡ</f> He is thrust from light into darkness, </t><t>and driven out of the world.</t>
18-19 <t>He has no <f>ⓢ</f>posterity or progeny among his people, </t><t>and no survivor where he used to live.</t>
18-20 <t>They of the west are appalled at his <f>ⓣ</f>day, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>horror seizes them of the east.</t>
18-21 <t>Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, </t><t>such is the place of him who <f>ⓥ</f>knows not God.” </t>
17-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
17-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
17-3 say, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓒ</f>A great eagle <f>ⓓ</f>with great wings and long pinions, <f>ⓔ</f>rich in plumage of many colors, came <f>ⓕ</f>to Lebanon <f>ⓖ</f>and took the top of the cedar.
17-4 He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants.
17-5 Then he took of the seed of the land <f>ⓗ</f>and planted it in fertile soil. <f>[1]</f> He placed it beside abundant waters. <f>ⓘ</f>He set it like a willow twig,
17-6 and it sprouted and became a <f>ⓙ</f>low <f>ⓚ</f>spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs.
17-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage, <f>ⓜ</f>and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from <f>ⓝ</f>the bed where it was planted, that he might water it.
17-8 <f>ⓞ</f> It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine.
17-9 <pb/>“Say, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓟ</f>Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers, so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots.
17-10 Behold, it is planted; will it thrive? <f>ⓠ</f>Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it — wither away on the bed where it sprouted?”
17-11 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me:
17-12 “Say now to <f>ⓡ</f>the rebellious house, <f>ⓢ</f>Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, behold, <f>ⓣ</f>the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon.
17-13 <f>ⓤ</f> And he took one of the royal offspring <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>and made a covenant with him, <f>ⓦ</f>putting him under oath (<f>ⓧ</f>the chief men of the land he had taken away),
17-14 that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and keep his covenant that it might stand.
17-15 <f>ⓨ</f> But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors <f>ⓩ</f>to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. <f>ⓐ</f>Will he thrive? Can one escape who does such things? Can he <f>ⓑ</f>break the covenant and yet escape?
17-16 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> “As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely <f>ⓓ</f>in the place where the king dwells <f>ⓔ</f>who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die.
17-17 <f>ⓕ</f> Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, <f>ⓖ</f>when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives.
17-18 He despised the oath in breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand and did all these things; he shall not escape.
17-19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. I will return it upon his head.
17-20 <f>ⓗ</f> I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon <f>ⓘ</f>and enter into judgment with him there <f>ⓙ</f>for the treachery he has committed against me.
17-21 And all the pick <f>[3]</f> of his troops shall fall by the sword, <f>ⓚ</f>and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind, and you shall know that <f>ⓛ</f>I am the LORD; I have spoken.”
17-22 <pb/>Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓜ</f>“I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out. <f>ⓝ</f>I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and <f>ⓞ</f>I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
17-23 <f>ⓟ</f> On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar. <f>ⓠ</f>And under it will dwell every kind of bird; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest.
17-24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the LORD; <f>ⓡ</f>I bring low the high tree, and make high the low tree, dry up <f>ⓢ</f>the green tree, and make <f>ⓣ</f>the dry tree flourish. <f>ⓤ</f>I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it.”
18-1 <pb/>After this I saw <f>ⓐ</f>another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and <f>ⓑ</f>the earth was made bright with his glory.
18-2 And he called out with a mighty voice, <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! </t><t>She has become <f>ⓓ</f>a dwelling place for demons, </t><t>a haunt <f>ⓔ</f>for every unclean spirit, </t><t>a haunt <f>ⓕ</f>for every unclean bird, </t><t>a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast.</t>
18-3 <t>For all nations have drunk <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.” </t>
18-4 <pb/>Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“Come out of her, my people, </t><t>lest you take part in her sins, </t><t>lest you share in her plagues;</t>
18-5 <t>for <f>ⓚ</f>her sins are heaped high as heaven, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>God has remembered her iniquities.</t>
18-6 <t><f>ⓜ</f> Pay her back as she herself has paid back others, </t><t>and repay her <f>ⓝ</f>double for her deeds; </t><t>mix a double portion for her <f>ⓞ</f>in the cup she mixed.</t>
18-7 <t><f>ⓟ</f> As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, </t><t>so give her a like measure of torment and mourning, </t><t>since in her heart she says, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>‘I sit as a queen, </t><t>I am no widow, </t><t>and mourning I shall never see.’</t>
18-8 <t>For this reason her plagues will come <f>ⓡ</f>in a single day, </t><t>death and mourning and famine, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>she will be burned up with fire; </t><t>for <f>ⓣ</f>mighty is the Lord God who has judged her.” </t>
18-9 <pb/>And <f>ⓤ</f>the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, <f>ⓥ</f>will weep and wail over her <f>ⓦ</f>when they see the smoke of her burning.
18-10 <f>ⓧ</f> They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, <pb/><t>“Alas! Alas! <f>ⓨ</f>You great city, </t><t>you mighty city, Babylon! </t><t>For <f>ⓩ</f>in a single hour your judgment has come.” </t>
18-11 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore,
18-12 cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble,
18-13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls. <f>[2]</f>
18-14 <pb/><t>“The fruit for which your soul longed </t><t>has gone from you, </t><t>and all your delicacies and your splendors </t><t>are lost to you, </t><t>never to be found again!” </t>
18-15 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, <f>ⓒ</f>will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud,
18-16 <pb/><t>“Alas, alas, for the great city </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>that was clothed in fine linen, </t><t>in purple and scarlet, </t><t>adorned with gold, </t><t>with jewels, and with pearls!</t>
18-17 <t>For <f>ⓔ</f>in a single hour all this wealth <f>ⓕ</f>has been laid waste.” </t> <pb/>And <f>ⓖ</f>all shipmasters and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off
18-18 and <f>ⓗ</f>cried out <f>ⓘ</f>as they saw the smoke of her burning, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“What city was like the great city?” </t>
18-19 <pb/>And they threw <f>ⓚ</f>dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out, <pb/><t>“Alas, alas, for the great city </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>where all who had ships at sea </t><t>grew rich by her wealth! </t><t>For <f>ⓜ</f>in a single hour she has been laid waste.</t>
18-20 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Rejoice over her, O heaven, </t><t>and you saints and <f>ⓞ</f>apostles and prophets, </t><t>for <f>ⓟ</f>God has given judgment for you against her!” </t>
18-21 <pb/>Then <f>ⓠ</f>a mighty angel <f>ⓡ</f>took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, <pb/><t>“So will Babylon <f>ⓢ</f>the great city be thrown down with violence, </t><t>and will be found no more;</t>
18-22 <t>and <f>ⓣ</f>the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters, </t><t>will be heard in you no more, </t><t>and a craftsman of any craft </t><t>will be found in you no more, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>the sound of the mill </t><t>will be heard in you no more,</t>

18-24 <t>And <f>ⓨ</f>in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, </t><t>and of <f>ⓩ</f>all who have been slain on earth.” </t>
