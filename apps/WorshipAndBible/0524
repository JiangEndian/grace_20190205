Exodus 39-1 <pb/>From the <f>ⓐ</f>blue and purple and scarlet yarns they made <f>ⓑ</f>finely woven garments, <f>[1]</f> for ministering in the Holy Place. They made the holy garments for Aaron, <f>ⓒ</f>as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> He made the ephod of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen.
Exodus 39-3 And they hammered out gold leaf, and he cut it into threads to work into the blue and purple and the scarlet yarns, and into the fine twined linen, in skilled design.
Exodus 39-4 They made for the ephod attaching shoulder pieces, joined to it at its two edges.
Exodus 39-5 And the skillfully woven band on it was of one piece with it and made like it, of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39-6 <pb/>They made the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold filigree, and engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel.
Exodus 39-7 And he set them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod to be stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39-8 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> He made the breastpiece, in skilled work, in the style of the ephod, of gold, blue and purple and scarlet yarns, and fine twined linen.
Exodus 39-9 It was square. They made the breastpiece doubled, a span <f>[2]</f> its length and a span its breadth when doubled.
Exodus 39-10 And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row;
Exodus 39-11 and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;
Exodus 39-12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
Exodus 39-13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in settings of gold filigree.
Exodus 39-14 There were twelve stones with their names according to the names of the sons of Israel. They were like signets, each engraved with its name, for the twelve tribes.
Exodus 39-15 And they made on the breastpiece twisted chains like cords, of pure gold.
Exodus 39-16 And they made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two edges of the breastpiece.
Exodus 39-17 And they put the two cords of gold in the two rings at the edges of the breastpiece.
Exodus 39-18 They attached the two ends of the two cords to the two settings of filigree. Thus they attached it in front to the shoulder pieces of the ephod.
Exodus 39-19 Then they made two rings of gold, and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod.
Exodus 39-20 And they made two rings of gold, and attached them in front to the lower part of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, at its seam above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.
Exodus 39-21 And they bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, so that it should lie on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece should not come loose from the ephod, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39-22 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> He also made the robe of the ephod woven all of blue,
Exodus 39-23 and the opening of the robe in it was like the opening in a garment, with a binding around the opening, so that it might not tear.
Exodus 39-24 On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen.
Exodus 39-25 They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around the hem of the robe, between the pomegranates —
Exodus 39-26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate around the hem of the robe for ministering, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39-27 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> They also made the coats, woven of fine <f>ⓗ</f>linen, for Aaron and his sons,
Exodus 39-28 and the <f>ⓘ</f>turban of fine linen, and the caps of fine linen, and the linen undergarments of fine twined linen,
Exodus 39-29 and the sash of fine twined linen and of blue and purple and scarlet yarns, embroidered with needlework, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39-30 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription, like the engraving of a signet, “Holy to the LORD.”
Exodus 39-31 And they tied to it a cord of blue to fasten it on the turban above, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39-32 <pb/>Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished, and the people of Israel did <f>ⓚ</f>according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.
Exodus 39-33 Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its utensils, its hooks, its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;
Exodus 39-34 the covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins, and the <f>ⓛ</f>veil of the screen;
Exodus 39-35 the ark of the testimony with its poles and the mercy seat;

Ezekiel 17-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 17-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
Ezekiel 17-3 say, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓒ</f>A great eagle <f>ⓓ</f>with great wings and long pinions, <f>ⓔ</f>rich in plumage of many colors, came <f>ⓕ</f>to Lebanon <f>ⓖ</f>and took the top of the cedar.
Ezekiel 17-4 He broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade and set it in a city of merchants.
Ezekiel 17-5 Then he took of the seed of the land <f>ⓗ</f>and planted it in fertile soil. <f>[1]</f> He placed it beside abundant waters. <f>ⓘ</f>He set it like a willow twig,
Ezekiel 17-6 and it sprouted and became a <f>ⓙ</f>low <f>ⓚ</f>spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine and produced branches and put out boughs.
Ezekiel 17-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “And there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage, <f>ⓜ</f>and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from <f>ⓝ</f>the bed where it was planted, that he might water it.
Ezekiel 17-8 <f>ⓞ</f> It had been planted on good soil by abundant waters, that it might produce branches and bear fruit and become a noble vine.
Ezekiel 17-9 <pb/>“Say, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓟ</f>Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit, so that it withers, so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots.
Ezekiel 17-10 Behold, it is planted; will it thrive? <f>ⓠ</f>Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it — wither away on the bed where it sprouted?”
Ezekiel 17-11 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 17-12 “Say now to <f>ⓡ</f>the rebellious house, <f>ⓢ</f>Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, behold, <f>ⓣ</f>the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon.
Ezekiel 17-13 <f>ⓤ</f> And he took one of the royal offspring <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>and made a covenant with him, <f>ⓦ</f>putting him under oath (<f>ⓧ</f>the chief men of the land he had taken away),
Ezekiel 17-14 that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and keep his covenant that it might stand.
Ezekiel 17-15 <f>ⓨ</f> But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors <f>ⓩ</f>to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. <f>ⓐ</f>Will he thrive? Can one escape who does such things? Can he <f>ⓑ</f>break the covenant and yet escape?
Ezekiel 17-16 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> “As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely <f>ⓓ</f>in the place where the king dwells <f>ⓔ</f>who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die.
Ezekiel 17-17 <f>ⓕ</f> Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, <f>ⓖ</f>when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives.
Ezekiel 17-18 He despised the oath in breaking the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand and did all these things; he shall not escape.
Ezekiel 17-19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely it is my oath that he despised, and my covenant that he broke. I will return it upon his head.
Ezekiel 17-20 <f>ⓗ</f> I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon <f>ⓘ</f>and enter into judgment with him there <f>ⓙ</f>for the treachery he has committed against me.
Ezekiel 17-21 And all the pick <f>[3]</f> of his troops shall fall by the sword, <f>ⓚ</f>and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind, and you shall know that <f>ⓛ</f>I am the LORD; I have spoken.”
Ezekiel 17-22 <pb/>Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓜ</f>“I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar and will set it out. <f>ⓝ</f>I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and <f>ⓞ</f>I myself will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
Ezekiel 17-23 <f>ⓟ</f> On the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bear branches and produce fruit and become a noble cedar. <f>ⓠ</f>And under it will dwell every kind of bird; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest.
Ezekiel 17-24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the LORD; <f>ⓡ</f>I bring low the high tree, and make high the low tree, dry up <f>ⓢ</f>the green tree, and make <f>ⓣ</f>the dry tree flourish. <f>ⓤ</f>I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it.”
Revelation 18-1 <pb/>After this I saw <f>ⓐ</f>another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and <f>ⓑ</f>the earth was made bright with his glory.
Revelation 18-2 And he called out with a mighty voice, <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! </t><t>She has become <f>ⓓ</f>a dwelling place for demons, </t><t>a haunt <f>ⓔ</f>for every unclean spirit, </t><t>a haunt <f>ⓕ</f>for every unclean bird, </t><t>a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast.</t>
Revelation 18-3 <t>For all nations have drunk <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.” </t>
Revelation 18-4 <pb/>Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“Come out of her, my people, </t><t>lest you take part in her sins, </t><t>lest you share in her plagues;</t>
Revelation 18-5 <t>for <f>ⓚ</f>her sins are heaped high as heaven, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>God has remembered her iniquities.</t>
Revelation 18-6 <t><f>ⓜ</f> Pay her back as she herself has paid back others, </t><t>and repay her <f>ⓝ</f>double for her deeds; </t><t>mix a double portion for her <f>ⓞ</f>in the cup she mixed.</t>
Revelation 18-7 <t><f>ⓟ</f> As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, </t><t>so give her a like measure of torment and mourning, </t><t>since in her heart she says, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>‘I sit as a queen, </t><t>I am no widow, </t><t>and mourning I shall never see.’</t>
Revelation 18-8 <t>For this reason her plagues will come <f>ⓡ</f>in a single day, </t><t>death and mourning and famine, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>she will be burned up with fire; </t><t>for <f>ⓣ</f>mighty is the Lord God who has judged her.” </t>
Revelation 18-9 <pb/>And <f>ⓤ</f>the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, <f>ⓥ</f>will weep and wail over her <f>ⓦ</f>when they see the smoke of her burning.
Revelation 18-10 <f>ⓧ</f> They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, <pb/><t>“Alas! Alas! <f>ⓨ</f>You great city, </t><t>you mighty city, Babylon! </t><t>For <f>ⓩ</f>in a single hour your judgment has come.” </t>
Revelation 18-11 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore,
Revelation 18-12 cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble,
Revelation 18-13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls. <f>[2]</f>
Revelation 18-14 <pb/><t>“The fruit for which your soul longed </t><t>has gone from you, </t><t>and all your delicacies and your splendors </t><t>are lost to you, </t><t>never to be found again!” </t>
Revelation 18-15 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, <f>ⓒ</f>will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud,
Revelation 18-16 <pb/><t>“Alas, alas, for the great city </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>that was clothed in fine linen, </t><t>in purple and scarlet, </t><t>adorned with gold, </t><t>with jewels, and with pearls!</t>
Revelation 18-17 <t>For <f>ⓔ</f>in a single hour all this wealth <f>ⓕ</f>has been laid waste.” </t> <pb/>And <f>ⓖ</f>all shipmasters and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off
Revelation 18-18 and <f>ⓗ</f>cried out <f>ⓘ</f>as they saw the smoke of her burning, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“What city was like the great city?” </t>
Revelation 18-19 <pb/>And they threw <f>ⓚ</f>dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out, <pb/><t>“Alas, alas, for the great city </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>where all who had ships at sea </t><t>grew rich by her wealth! </t><t>For <f>ⓜ</f>in a single hour she has been laid waste.</t>
Revelation 18-20 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Rejoice over her, O heaven, </t><t>and you saints and <f>ⓞ</f>apostles and prophets, </t><t>for <f>ⓟ</f>God has given judgment for you against her!” </t>
Revelation 18-21 <pb/>Then <f>ⓠ</f>a mighty angel <f>ⓡ</f>took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, <pb/><t>“So will Babylon <f>ⓢ</f>the great city be thrown down with violence, </t><t>and will be found no more;</t>
Revelation 18-22 <t>and <f>ⓣ</f>the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters, </t><t>will be heard in you no more, </t><t>and a craftsman of any craft </t><t>will be found in you no more, </t><t>and <f>ⓤ</f>the sound of the mill </t><t>will be heard in you no more,</t>
