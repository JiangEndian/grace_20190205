Exodus 7-1 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “See, I have made you like <f>ⓐ</f>God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your <f>ⓑ</f>prophet.
Exodus 7-2 <f>ⓒ</f> You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus 7-3 But <f>ⓓ</f>I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I <f>ⓔ</f>multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
Exodus 7-4 Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.
Exodus 7-5 The Egyptians <f>ⓕ</f>shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from among them.”
Exodus 7-6 Moses and Aaron did so; they did just as the LORD commanded them.
Exodus 7-7 Now Moses was <f>ⓖ</f>eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus 7-8 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
Exodus 7-9 “When Pharaoh says to you, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Prove yourselves by working a miracle,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.’”
Exodus 7-10 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.
Exodus 7-11 Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers, and they, the <f>ⓘ</f>magicians of Egypt, also <f>ⓙ</f>did the same by their secret arts.
Exodus 7-12 For each man cast down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
Exodus 7-13 Still <f>ⓚ</f>Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them, <f>ⓛ</f>as the LORD had said.
Exodus 7-14 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go.
Exodus 7-15 <f>ⓜ</f> Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand <f>ⓝ</f>the staff that turned into a <f>ⓞ</f>serpent.
Exodus 7-16 And you shall say to him, ‘The <f>ⓟ</f>LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, “Let my people go, <f>ⓠ</f>that they may serve me in the wilderness.” But so far, you have not obeyed.
Exodus 7-17 Thus says the LORD, “By this <f>ⓡ</f>you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, with the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water that is in the Nile, and <f>ⓢ</f>it shall turn into blood.
Exodus 7-18 The fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile will stink, and the Egyptians will <f>ⓣ</f>grow weary of drinking water from the Nile.”’”
Exodus 7-19 And the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and <f>ⓤ</f>stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, so that they may become blood, and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’”
Exodus 7-20 <pb/>Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded. In the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants he <f>ⓥ</f>lifted up the staff and struck the water in the Nile, and all the <f>ⓦ</f>water in the Nile turned into blood.
Exodus 7-21 And the fish in the Nile died, and the Nile stank, so that the Egyptians <f>ⓧ</f>could not drink water from the Nile. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus 7-22 But <f>ⓨ</f>the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts. So <f>ⓩ</f>Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them, as <f>ⓐ</f>the LORD had said.
Exodus 7-23 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.
Exodus 7-24 And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.
Exodus 7-25 <pb/>Seven full days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.
Nehemiah 9-1 <pb/>Now on the twenty-fourth day of <f>ⓐ</f>this month the people of Israel were assembled <f>ⓑ</f>with fasting <f>ⓒ</f>and in sackcloth, <f>ⓓ</f>and with earth on their heads.
Nehemiah 9-2 <f>ⓔ</f> And the Israelites <f>[1]</f> separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
Nehemiah 9-3 <f>ⓕ</f> And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day; for another quarter of it they made confession and worshiped the LORD their God.
Nehemiah 9-4 On the stairs of the Levites stood <f>ⓖ</f>Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani; and they cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
Nehemiah 9-5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, “Stand up and bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting. <f>ⓗ</f>Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
Nehemiah 9-6 <pb/><f>[2]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>“You are the LORD, you alone. <f>ⓙ</f>You have made heaven, <f>ⓚ</f>the heaven of heavens, <f>ⓛ</f>with all their host, <f>ⓜ</f>the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; <f>ⓝ</f>and you preserve all of them; and the host of heaven worships you.
Nehemiah 9-7 You are the LORD, the God <f>ⓞ</f>who chose Abram and brought him out of <f>ⓟ</f>Ur of the Chaldeans <f>ⓠ</f>and gave him the name Abraham.
Nehemiah 9-8 <f>ⓡ</f> You found his heart faithful before you, <f>ⓢ</f>and made with him the covenant to give to his offspring <f>ⓣ</f>the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite. <f>ⓤ</f>And you have kept your promise, for you are righteous.
Nehemiah 9-9 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> “And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and heard <f>ⓦ</f>their cry at the Red Sea,
Nehemiah 9-10 <f>ⓧ</f> and performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land, for you knew that <f>ⓨ</f>they acted arrogantly against our fathers. And <f>ⓩ</f>you made a name for yourself, as it is to this day.
Nehemiah 9-11 <f>ⓐ</f> And you divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on dry land, and you cast their pursuers into the depths, <f>ⓑ</f>as a stone into mighty waters.
Nehemiah 9-12 By <f>ⓒ</f>a pillar of cloud you led them in the day, and by a pillar of fire in the night to light for them the way in which they should go.
Nehemiah 9-13 <f>ⓓ</f> You came down on Mount Sinai <f>ⓔ</f>and spoke with them from heaven and gave them <f>ⓕ</f>right rules and true laws, good statutes and commandments,
Nehemiah 9-14 <f>ⓖ</f> and you made known to them your holy Sabbath and commanded them commandments and statutes and a law by Moses your servant.
Nehemiah 9-15 <f>ⓗ</f> You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger and <f>ⓘ</f>brought water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and you <f>ⓙ</f>told them to go in to possess the land that you had sworn to give them.
Nehemiah 9-16 <pb/>“But they and our fathers <f>ⓚ</f>acted presumptuously and stiffened their neck and did not obey your commandments.
Nehemiah 9-17 They refused to obey <f>ⓛ</f>and were not mindful of the wonders that you performed among them, but they stiffened their neck and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. <f>[3]</f> But you are a God ready to forgive, <f>ⓜ</f>gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and did not forsake them.
Nehemiah 9-18 Even <f>ⓝ</f>when they had made for themselves a golden <f>[4]</f> calf and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ <f>ⓞ</f>and had committed great blasphemies,
Nehemiah 9-19 you <f>ⓟ</f>in your great mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness. <f>ⓠ</f>The pillar of cloud to lead them in the way did not depart from them by day, <f>ⓡ</f>nor the pillar of fire by night to light for them the way by which they should go.
Nehemiah 9-20 <f>ⓢ</f> You gave your good Spirit to instruct them <f>ⓣ</f>and did not withhold your manna from their mouth and gave them water for their thirst.
Nehemiah 9-21 <f>ⓤ</f> Forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.
Nehemiah 9-22 <pb/>“And you gave them kingdoms and peoples and allotted to them every corner. <f>ⓥ</f>So they took possession of the land of Sihon king of Heshbon <f>ⓦ</f>and the land of Og king of Bashan.
Nehemiah 9-23 You multiplied their children <f>ⓧ</f>as the stars of heaven, and you brought them into the land that you had told their fathers to enter and possess.
Nehemiah 9-24 <f>ⓨ</f> So the descendants went in and possessed the land, <f>ⓩ</f>and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
Nehemiah 9-25 And they captured <f>ⓐ</f>fortified cities and <f>ⓑ</f>a rich land, and took possession of <f>ⓒ</f>houses full of all good things, cisterns already hewn, vineyards, olive orchards and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled <f>ⓓ</f>and became fat and delighted themselves in <f>ⓔ</f>your great goodness.
Nehemiah 9-26 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> “Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you <f>ⓖ</f>and cast your law behind their back <f>ⓗ</f>and killed your prophets, who <f>ⓘ</f>had warned them in order to turn them back to you, <f>ⓙ</f>and they committed great blasphemies.
Nehemiah 9-27 <f>ⓚ</f> Therefore you gave them into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer. <f>ⓛ</f>And in the time of their suffering they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven, and according to your great mercies you gave them <f>ⓜ</f>saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies.
Nehemiah 9-28 <f>ⓝ</f> But after they had rest they did evil again before you, and you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them. Yet when they turned and cried to you, you heard from heaven, <f>ⓞ</f>and many times you delivered them according to your mercies.
Nehemiah 9-29 <f>ⓟ</f> And you warned them in order to turn them back to your law. Yet <f>ⓠ</f>they acted presumptuously and did not obey your commandments, but sinned against your rules, <f>ⓡ</f>which if a person does them, he shall live by them, <f>ⓢ</f>and they turned a stubborn shoulder <f>ⓣ</f>and stiffened their neck and would not obey.
Nehemiah 9-30 Many years <f>ⓤ</f>you bore with them <f>ⓥ</f>and warned them <f>ⓦ</f>by your Spirit through your prophets. <f>ⓧ</f>Yet they would not give ear. <f>ⓨ</f>Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
Nehemiah 9-31 Nevertheless, <f>ⓩ</f>in your great mercies <f>ⓐ</f>you did not make an end of them or forsake them, <f>ⓑ</f>for you are a gracious and merciful God.
Nehemiah 9-32 <pb/>“Now, therefore, our God, <f>ⓒ</f>the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love, let not all the hardship seem little to you that has come upon us, upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our fathers, and all your people, <f>ⓓ</f>since the time of the kings of Assyria until this day.
Nehemiah 9-33 <f>ⓔ</f> Yet you have been righteous in all that has come upon us, for you have dealt faithfully <f>ⓕ</f>and we have acted wickedly.
Nehemiah 9-34 Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or paid attention to your commandments and your warnings that you gave them.
Nehemiah 9-35 Even in their own kingdom, <f>ⓖ</f>and amid your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and <f>ⓗ</f>rich land that you set before them, <f>ⓘ</f>they did not serve you or turn from their wicked works.
Nehemiah 9-36 Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>we are slaves this day; in the land that you gave to our fathers to enjoy its fruit and its good gifts, behold, we are slaves.
Nehemiah 9-37 <f>ⓚ</f> And its rich yield goes to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and over our livestock as they please, and we are in great distress.
Nehemiah 9-38 <pb/><f>[5]</f> “Because of all this <f>ⓛ</f>we make a firm covenant in writing; on <f>ⓜ</f>the sealed document are the names of <f>[6]</f> our princes, our Levites, and our priests.
Jeremiah 42-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>all the commanders of the forces, and <f>ⓑ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Hoshaiah, and all the people <f>ⓓ</f>from the least to the greatest, came near
Jeremiah 42-2 and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Let <f>ⓔ</f>our plea for mercy come before you, and <f>ⓕ</f>pray to the LORD your God for us, for all <f>ⓖ</f>this remnant — <f>ⓗ</f>because we are left with but a few, as your eyes see us —
Jeremiah 42-3 that <f>ⓘ</f>the LORD your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that we should do.”
Jeremiah 42-4 Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your request, and <f>ⓙ</f>whatever the LORD answers you I will tell you. <f>ⓚ</f>I will keep nothing back from you.”
Jeremiah 42-5 Then they said to Jeremiah, <f>ⓛ</f>“May the LORD be a true and <f>ⓜ</f>faithful witness against us <f>ⓝ</f>if we do not act according to all the word <f>ⓞ</f>with which the LORD your God sends you to us.
Jeremiah 42-6 Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, <f>ⓟ</f>that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.”
Jeremiah 42-7 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> At the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah 42-8 Then he summoned <f>ⓡ</f>Johanan the son of Kareah and <f>ⓢ</f>all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people <f>ⓣ</f>from the least to the greatest,
Jeremiah 42-9 and said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓤ</f>to whom you sent me to present your plea for mercy before him:
Jeremiah 42-10 If you will remain in this land, <f>ⓥ</f>then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; <f>ⓦ</f>for I relent of the disaster that I did to you.
Jeremiah 42-11 <f>ⓧ</f> Do not fear the king of Babylon, <f>ⓨ</f>of whom you are afraid. <f>ⓩ</f>Do not fear him, declares the LORD, <f>ⓐ</f>for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his hand.
Jeremiah 42-12 <f>ⓑ</f> I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land.
Jeremiah 42-13 <f>ⓒ</f> But if you say, ‘We will not remain in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the LORD your God
Jeremiah 42-14 and saying, ‘No, <f>ⓓ</f>we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war or <f>ⓔ</f>hear the sound of the trumpet or <f>ⓕ</f>be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,’
Jeremiah 42-15 then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓖ</f>If you set your faces to enter Egypt <f>ⓗ</f>and go to live there,
Jeremiah 42-16 then the sword <f>ⓘ</f>that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt, <f>ⓙ</f>and there you shall die.
Jeremiah 42-17 All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. They shall have <f>ⓚ</f>no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them.
Jeremiah 42-18 <pb/>“For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓛ</f>As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. <f>ⓜ</f>You shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt.

Jeremiah 42-19 The LORD has said to you, O remnant of Judah, <f>ⓝ</f>‘Do not go to Egypt.’ <f>ⓞ</f>Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day
Jeremiah 42-20 that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. <f>ⓟ</f>For you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Pray for us to the LORD our God, and <f>ⓡ</f>whatever the LORD our God says, declare to us and we will do it.’
Jeremiah 42-21 And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything <f>ⓢ</f>that he sent me to tell you.
Jeremiah 42-22 <f>ⓣ</f> Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.”
1 Peter 2-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
1 Peter 2-2 <f>ⓑ</f> Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual <f>ⓒ</f>milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation —

1 Peter 2-4 <pb/>As you come to him, a living stone <f>ⓔ</f>rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious,
1 Peter 2-5 <f>ⓕ</f> you yourselves like living stones are being built up as <f>ⓖ</f>a spiritual house, to be <f>ⓗ</f>a holy priesthood, <f>ⓘ</f>to offer spiritual sacrifices <f>ⓙ</f>acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
1 Peter 2-6 For it stands in Scripture: <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, </t><t>a cornerstone chosen and precious, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” </t>
1 Peter 2-7 <pb/>So the honor is for you who <f>ⓜ</f>believe, but for those who <f>ⓝ</f>do not believe, <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>“The stone that the builders rejected </t><t>has become the cornerstone,” <f>[1]</f> </t>

1 Peter 2-15 For this is the will of God, <f>ⓘ</f>that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
1 Peter 2-16 <f>ⓙ</f> Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but <f>ⓚ</f>living as servants <f>[4]</f> of God.

1 Peter 2-20 For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But <f>ⓠ</f>if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
1 Peter 2-21 For <f>ⓡ</f>to this you have been called, <f>ⓢ</f>because Christ also suffered for you, <f>ⓣ</f>leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.
1 Peter 2-22 <f>ⓤ</f> He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
1 Peter 2-23 <f>ⓥ</f> When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, <f>ⓦ</f>but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.
1 Peter 2-24 <f>ⓧ</f> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we <f>ⓨ</f>might die to sin and <f>ⓩ</f>live to righteousness. <f>ⓐ</f>By his wounds you have been healed.
