7-1 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Noah, <f>ⓐ</f>“Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that <f>ⓑ</f>you are righteous before me in this generation.
7-2 Take with you seven pairs of all <f>ⓒ</f>clean animals, <f>[1]</f> the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate,
7-3 and seven pairs <f>[2]</f> of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.
7-4 For in seven days <f>ⓓ</f>I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, <f>ⓔ</f>and every living thing <f>[3]</f> that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.”
7-5 <f>ⓕ</f> And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
7-6 <pb/>Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.
7-7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
7-8 Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
7-9 two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.
7-10 And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.
7-11 <pb/>In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the <f>ⓖ</f>fountains of the great deep burst forth, and <f>ⓗ</f>the windows of the heavens were opened.
7-12 And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
7-13 On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,
7-14 they and every beast, according to its kind, and all the livestock according to their kinds, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, according to its kind, and every bird, according to its kind, every winged creature.
7-15 They <f>ⓘ</f>went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
7-16 And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in <f>ⓙ</f>as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in.
7-17 <pb/>The flood <f>ⓚ</f>continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
7-18 The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
7-19 And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
7-20 The waters prevailed above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits <f>[4]</f> deep.
7-21 And <f>ⓛ</f>all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind.
7-22 Everything on the dry land <f>ⓜ</f>in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
7-23 He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. They were blotted out from the earth. Only <f>ⓝ</f>Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.
7-24 And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.
5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, and stored the silver, the gold, and all the vessels in the treasuries of the house of God.
5-2 <pb/>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of <f>ⓑ</f>the city of David, which is Zion.
5-3 And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast that is in the seventh month.
5-4 And all the elders of Israel came, <f>ⓒ</f>and the Levites took up the ark.
5-5 And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; <f>ⓓ</f>the Levitical priests brought them up.
5-6 And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
5-7 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.
5-8 The cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles.
5-9 And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen <f>ⓔ</f>from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from outside. And they are <f>[1]</f> there to this day.
5-10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets <f>ⓕ</f>that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
5-11 And when the priests came out of the Holy Place (for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without regard to <f>ⓖ</f>their divisions,
5-12 and all the Levitical <f>ⓗ</f>singers, <f>ⓘ</f>Asaph, <f>ⓙ</f>Heman, and Jeduthun, their sons and kinsmen, arrayed in fine linen, with <f>ⓚ</f>cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with 120 <f>ⓛ</f>priests who were trumpeters;
5-13 and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the LORD), and when the song was raised, <f>ⓜ</f>with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the LORD, <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“For he is good, </t><t>for his steadfast love endures forever,” </t> <pb/>the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud,
5-14 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, <f>ⓞ</f>for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.
58-1 <pb/><t>“Cry aloud; do not hold back; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>lift up your voice like a trumpet; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>declare to my people their transgression, </t><t>to the house of Jacob their sins.</t>
58-2 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Yet they seek me daily </t><t>and delight to know my ways, </t><t>as if they were a nation that did righteousness </t><t>and did not forsake the judgment of their God; </t><t>they ask of me righteous judgments; </t><t>they delight to draw near to God.</t>
58-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> ‘Why have we fasted, and you see it not? </t><t>Why have we humbled ourselves, and you take no knowledge of it?’ </t><t>Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure, <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>and oppress all your workers.</t>
58-4 <t>Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight </t><t>and to hit with a wicked fist. </t><t>Fasting like yours this day </t><t>will not make your voice to be heard on high.</t>
58-5 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Is such the fast that I choose, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>a day for a person to humble himself? </t><t>Is it to bow down his head like a reed, </t><t>and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? </t><t>Will you call this a fast, </t><t>and a day acceptable to the LORD? </t>
58-6 <pb/><t>“Is not this the fast that I choose: </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>to loose the bonds of wickedness, </t><t>to undo the straps <f>ⓘ</f>of the yoke, </t><t>to let the oppressed <f>[2]</f> go free, </t><t>and to break every yoke?</t>
58-7 <t>Is it not <f>ⓙ</f>to share your bread with the hungry </t><t>and bring the homeless poor into your house; </t><t>when you see the naked, to cover him, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?</t>
58-8 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and your healing shall spring up speedily; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>your righteousness shall go before you; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.</t>
58-9 <t>Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer; </t><t>you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’ </t><t>If you take away <f>ⓟ</f>the yoke from your midst, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,</t>
58-10 <t><f>ⓡ</f> if you pour yourself out for the hungry </t><t>and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>then shall your light rise in the darkness </t><t>and your gloom be as the noonday.</t>
58-11 <t>And the LORD will guide you continually </t><t>and satisfy your desire in scorched places </t><t>and make your bones strong; </t><t>and you shall be <f>ⓣ</f>like a watered garden, </t><t>like a spring of water, </t><t>whose waters do not fail.</t>
58-12 <t><f>ⓤ</f> And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; </t><t>you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; </t><t>you shall be called the repairer of the breach, </t><t>the restorer of streets to dwell in. </t>
58-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f> “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, </t><t>from doing your pleasure <f>[3]</f> on my holy day, </t><t>and call the Sabbath a delight </t><t>and the holy day of the LORD honorable; </t><t>if you honor it, not going your own ways, </t><t>or seeking <f>ⓦ</f>your own pleasure, <f>[4]</f> or talking idly; <f>[5]</f></t>
58-14 <t>then you shall take delight in the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; <f>[6]</f> </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.” </t>
6-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
6-2 <f>ⓑ</f> “Honor your father and mother” (this is the first commandment with a promise),
6-3 “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.”
6-4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, <f>ⓒ</f>but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
6-5 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Bondservants, <f>[1]</f> obey your earthly masters <f>[2]</f> with fear and trembling, <f>ⓔ</f>with a sincere heart, <f>ⓕ</f>as you would Christ,
6-6 not by the way of eye-service, as <f>ⓖ</f>people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,
6-7 rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man,
6-8 <f>ⓗ</f> knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, <f>ⓘ</f>whether he is a bondservant or is free.
6-9 Masters, do the same to them, <f>ⓙ</f>and stop your threatening, knowing that <f>ⓚ</f>he who is both their Master <f>[3]</f> and yours is in heaven, and that <f>ⓛ</f>there is no partiality with him.
6-10 <pb/>Finally, <f>ⓜ</f>be strong in the Lord and in <f>ⓝ</f>the strength of his might.
6-11 <f>ⓞ</f> Put on <f>ⓟ</f>the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against <f>ⓠ</f>the schemes of the devil.

6-13 Therefore <f>ⓧ</f>take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in <f>ⓨ</f>the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.
6-14 Stand therefore, <f>ⓩ</f>having fastened on the belt of truth, and <f>ⓐ</f>having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
6-15 and, <f>ⓑ</f>as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace.
6-16 In all circumstances take up <f>ⓒ</f>the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all <f>ⓓ</f>the flaming darts of <f>ⓔ</f>the evil one;
6-17 and take <f>ⓕ</f>the helmet of salvation, and <f>ⓖ</f>the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
6-18 praying <f>ⓗ</f>at all times <f>ⓘ</f>in the Spirit, <f>ⓙ</f>with all prayer and supplication. To that end, <f>ⓚ</f>keep alert with all perseverance, making <f>ⓛ</f>supplication for all the saints,
