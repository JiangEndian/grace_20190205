1 Chronicles 23-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> When David was old and full of days, <f>ⓑ</f>he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
1 Chronicles 23-2 <pb/>David <f>[1]</f> assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites.
1 Chronicles 23-3 The Levites, <f>ⓒ</f>thirty years old and upward, were numbered, and <f>ⓓ</f>the total was <f>ⓔ</f>38,000 men.
1 Chronicles 23-4 “Twenty-four thousand of these,” David said, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>“shall have charge of the work in the house of the LORD, 6,000 shall be <f>ⓖ</f>officers and judges,
1 Chronicles 23-5 4,000 gatekeepers, and 4,000 shall offer praises to the LORD with the instruments <f>ⓗ</f>that I have made for praise.”
1 Chronicles 23-6 <f>ⓘ</f> And David organized them in divisions <f>ⓙ</f>corresponding to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1 Chronicles 23-7 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> The sons of Gershon <f>[3]</f> were Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles 23-8 The sons of Ladan: <f>ⓛ</f>Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
1 Chronicles 23-9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers' houses of Ladan.
1 Chronicles 23-10 And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
1 Chronicles 23-11 Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, therefore they became counted as a single father's house.
1 Chronicles 23-12 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
1 Chronicles 23-13 <f>ⓝ</f> The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. <f>ⓞ</f>Aaron was set apart to dedicate the most holy things, that he and his sons forever should <f>ⓟ</f>make offerings before the LORD and <f>ⓠ</f>minister to him and <f>ⓡ</f>pronounce blessings in his name forever.
1 Chronicles 23-14 But the sons of Moses the <f>ⓢ</f>man of God were named among the <f>ⓣ</f>tribe of Levi.
1 Chronicles 23-15 The <f>ⓤ</f>sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
1 Chronicles 23-16 The sons of Gershom: <f>ⓥ</f>Shebuel the chief.
1 Chronicles 23-17 The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
1 Chronicles 23-18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.
1 Chronicles 23-19 The <f>ⓦ</f>sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
1 Chronicles 23-20 <f>ⓧ</f> The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second.
1 Chronicles 23-21 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and <f>ⓩ</f>Kish.
1 Chronicles 23-22 Eleazar died <f>ⓐ</f>having no sons, but only daughters; their <f>ⓑ</f>kinsmen, the sons of Kish, married them.
1 Chronicles 23-23 <f>ⓒ</f> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1 Chronicles 23-24 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> These were the sons of Levi by their fathers' houses, the heads of fathers' houses <f>ⓔ</f>as they were listed according to the number of the names of the individuals from <f>ⓕ</f>twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of the house of the LORD.
1 Chronicles 23-25 For David said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓖ</f>has given rest to his people, and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.
1 Chronicles 23-26 And so the Levites no longer need <f>ⓗ</f>to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service.”
1 Chronicles 23-27 For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from <f>ⓘ</f>twenty years old and upward.
1 Chronicles 23-28 For their duty was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God.
1 Chronicles 23-29 Their duty was also to assist with the <f>ⓙ</f>showbread, the <f>ⓚ</f>flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the <f>ⓛ</f>baked offering, the <f>ⓜ</f>offering mixed with oil, and all <f>ⓝ</f>measures of quantity or size.
1 Chronicles 23-30 And they were to stand every morning, thanking and praising the LORD, and likewise at evening,
1 Chronicles 23-31 and whenever burnt offerings were offered to the LORD <f>ⓞ</f>on Sabbaths, <f>ⓟ</f>new moons, and feast days, <f>ⓠ</f>according to the number required of them, regularly before the LORD.
1 Chronicles 23-32 Thus <f>ⓡ</f>they were to keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and to attend the sons of Aaron, their brothers, for the <f>ⓢ</f>service of the house of the LORD.
Isaiah 47-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Come down and sit in the dust, </t><t>O virgin <f>ⓑ</f>daughter of Babylon; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>sit on the ground without a throne, </t><t>O daughter of <f>ⓓ</f>the Chaldeans! </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>For you shall no more be called </t><t>tender and delicate.</t>
Isaiah 47-2 <t>Take the millstones and <f>ⓕ</f>grind flour, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>put off your veil, </t><t>strip off your robe, uncover your legs, </t><t>pass through the rivers.</t>
Isaiah 47-3 <t>Your nakedness shall be uncovered, </t><t>and your disgrace shall be seen. </t><t>I will take vengeance, </t><t>and I will spare no one.</t>
Isaiah 47-4 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Our Redeemer — the LORD of hosts is his name — </t><t>is the Holy One of Israel. </t>
Isaiah 47-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> Sit in silence, and go into darkness, </t><t>O daughter of <f>ⓙ</f>the Chaldeans; </t><t>for you shall no more be called </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>the mistress of kingdoms.</t>
Isaiah 47-6 <t><f>ⓛ</f> I was angry with my people; </t><t>I profaned my heritage; </t><t>I gave them into your hand; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>you showed them no mercy; </t><t>on the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.</t>
Isaiah 47-7 <t>You said, “I shall be <f>ⓝ</f>mistress forever,” </t><t>so that you did not lay these things to heart </t><t>or remember their end. </t>
Isaiah 47-8 <pb/><t>Now therefore hear this, <f>ⓞ</f>you lover of pleasures, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>who sit securely, </t><t>who say in your heart, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>“I am, and there is no one besides me; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>I shall not sit as a widow </t><t>or know the loss of children”:</t>
Isaiah 47-9 <t><f>ⓢ</f> These two things shall come to you </t><t>in a moment, <f>ⓣ</f>in one day; </t><t>the loss of children and widowhood </t><t>shall come upon you in full measure, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>in spite of your many sorceries </t><t>and the great power of your enchantments. </t>
Isaiah 47-10 <pb/><t>You felt secure in your wickedness; </t><t>you said, “No one sees me”; </t><t>your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, </t><t>and you said in your heart, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>“I am, and there is no one besides me.”</t>
Isaiah 47-11 <t>But evil shall come upon you, </t><t>which you will not know how to charm away; </t><t>disaster shall fall upon you, </t><t>for which you will not be able to atone; </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>and ruin shall come upon you suddenly, </t><t>of which you know nothing. </t>
Isaiah 47-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f> Stand fast in your enchantments </t><t>and your many sorceries, </t><t>with which you have labored from your youth; </t><t>perhaps you may be able to succeed; </t><t>perhaps you may inspire terror.</t>
Isaiah 47-13 <t>You are wearied with your many counsels; </t><t>let them stand forth and save you, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>those who divide the heavens, </t><t>who gaze at the stars, </t><t>who at the new moons make known </t><t>what shall come upon you. </t>
Isaiah 47-14 <pb/><t>Behold, <f>ⓩ</f>they are like stubble; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>the fire consumes them; </t><t>they cannot deliver themselves </t><t>from the power of the flame. </t><t>No coal for warming oneself is this, </t><t>no fire to sit before!</t>
Isaiah 47-15 <t>Such to you are those with whom you have labored, </t><t>who have done business with you from your youth; </t><t>they wander about, each in his own direction; </t><t>there is no one to save you. </t>
2 Corinthians 13-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established <f>ⓑ</f>by the evidence of two or three witnesses.
2 Corinthians 13-2 <f>ⓒ</f> I warned <f>ⓓ</f>those who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that <f>ⓔ</f>if I come again I will not spare them —
2 Corinthians 13-3 since you seek proof that Christ <f>ⓕ</f>is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but <f>ⓖ</f>is powerful among you.
2 Corinthians 13-4 For <f>ⓗ</f>he was crucified in weakness, but <f>ⓘ</f>lives by the power of God. For <f>ⓙ</f>we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you <f>ⓚ</f>we will live with him by the power of God.
2 Corinthians 13-5 <pb/>Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. <f>ⓛ</f>Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that <f>ⓜ</f>Jesus Christ is in you? — unless indeed you fail to meet the test!
2 Corinthians 13-6 I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test.
2 Corinthians 13-7 But we pray to God that you may not do wrong — not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed.
2 Corinthians 13-8 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
2 Corinthians 13-9 For we are glad when <f>ⓝ</f>we are weak and you are strong. Your <f>ⓞ</f>restoration is what we pray for.
2 Corinthians 13-10 For this reason I write these things while I am away from you, that when I come <f>ⓟ</f>I may not have to be <f>ⓠ</f>severe in my use of <f>ⓡ</f>the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
2 Corinthians 13-11 <pb/>Finally, brothers, <f>[1]</f> rejoice. <f>ⓢ</f>Aim for restoration, comfort one another, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓣ</f>agree with one another, <f>ⓤ</f>live in peace; and the God of love and <f>ⓥ</f>peace will be with you.
2 Corinthians 13-12 <f>ⓦ</f> Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians 13-13 <f>ⓧ</f> All the saints greet you.
2 Corinthians 13-14 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and <f>ⓩ</f>the love of God and <f>ⓐ</f>the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
