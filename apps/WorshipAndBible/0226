Genesis 2-1 <pb/>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and <f>ⓐ</f>all the host of them.
Genesis 2-2 And <f>ⓑ</f>on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
Genesis 2-3 So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
Genesis 2-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> These are the generations </t><t>of the heavens and the earth when they were created, </t><t>in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens. </t>
Genesis 2-5 <pb/>When no <f>ⓓ</f>bush of the field <f>[1]</f> was yet in the land <f>[2]</f> and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up — for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man <f>ⓔ</f>to work the ground,
Genesis 2-6 and a mist <f>[3]</f> was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground —
Genesis 2-7 then the LORD God formed the man of <f>ⓕ</f>dust from the ground and <f>ⓖ</f>breathed into his <f>ⓗ</f>nostrils the breath of life, and <f>ⓘ</f>the man became a living creature.
Genesis 2-8 And the LORD God planted a <f>ⓙ</f>garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Genesis 2-9 And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. <f>ⓚ</f>The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, <f>ⓛ</f>and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis 2-10 <pb/>A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.
Genesis 2-11 The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of <f>ⓜ</f>Havilah, where there is gold.
Genesis 2-12 And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
Genesis 2-13 The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.
Genesis 2-14 And the name of the third river is the <f>ⓝ</f>Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis 2-15 <pb/>The LORD God took the man <f>ⓞ</f>and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
Genesis 2-16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
Genesis 2-17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil <f>ⓟ</f>you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat <f>[4]</f> of it you <f>ⓠ</f>shall surely die.”
Genesis 2-18 <pb/>Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; <f>ⓡ</f>I will make him a helper fit for <f>[5]</f> him.”
Genesis 2-19 <f>ⓢ</f> Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed <f>[6]</f> every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and <f>ⓣ</f>brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
Genesis 2-20 The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam <f>[7]</f> there was not found a helper fit for him.
Genesis 2-21 So the LORD God caused a <f>ⓤ</f>deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
Genesis 2-22 And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made <f>[8]</f> into a woman and brought her to the man.
Genesis 2-23 Then the man said, <pb/><t>“This at last is <f>ⓥ</f>bone of my bones </t><t>and flesh of my flesh; </t><t>she shall be called Woman, </t><t>because she was <f>ⓦ</f>taken out of Man.” <f>[9]</f> </t>
Genesis 2-24 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
Genesis 2-25 And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
1 Chronicles 29-1 <pb/>And David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is <f>ⓐ</f>young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for <f>ⓑ</f>the palace will not be for man but for the LORD God.
1 Chronicles 29-2 So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of <f>ⓒ</f>onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble.
1 Chronicles 29-3 Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God:
1 Chronicles 29-4 <f>ⓓ</f> 3,000 talents <f>[1]</f> of gold, of the gold of <f>ⓔ</f>Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house, <f>[2]</f>
1 Chronicles 29-5 and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself <f>[3]</f> today to the LORD?”
1 Chronicles 29-6 <pb/>Then <f>ⓕ</f>the leaders of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and <f>ⓖ</f>the officers over the king's work.
1 Chronicles 29-7 They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 <f>ⓗ</f>darics <f>[4]</f> of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron.
1 Chronicles 29-8 And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in the care of <f>ⓘ</f>Jehiel the Gershonite.
1 Chronicles 29-9 Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a <f>ⓙ</f>whole heart they had offered freely to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly.
1 Chronicles 29-10 <pb/>Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: <f>ⓚ</f>“Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.
1 Chronicles 29-11 <f>ⓛ</f> Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.
1 Chronicles 29-12 <f>ⓜ</f> Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. <f>ⓝ</f>In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.
1 Chronicles 29-13 And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.
1 Chronicles 29-14 <pb/>“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.
1 Chronicles 29-15 <f>ⓞ</f> For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are <f>ⓟ</f>like a shadow, and there is no abiding. <f>[5]</f>
1 Chronicles 29-16 O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.
1 Chronicles 29-17 I know, my God, <f>ⓠ</f>that you test the heart and <f>ⓡ</f>have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.
1 Chronicles 29-18 O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.
1 Chronicles 29-19 <f>ⓢ</f> Grant to Solomon my son a whole heart that he may keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, performing all, and that he may <f>ⓣ</f>build the palace <f>ⓤ</f>for which I have made provision.”
1 Chronicles 29-20 <pb/>Then David said to all the assembly, <f>ⓥ</f>“Bless the LORD your God.” And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, <f>ⓦ</f>and bowed their heads and paid homage to the LORD and to the king.
1 Chronicles 29-21 And they offered sacrifices to the LORD, and on the next day offered burnt offerings to the LORD, 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, with their <f>ⓧ</f>drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
1 Chronicles 29-22 And they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. <pb/><e>Solomon Anointed King</e> </pb> <pb/>And they made Solomon the son of David king <f>ⓨ</f>the second time, and they <f>ⓩ</f>anointed him as prince for the LORD, and <f>ⓐ</f>Zadok as priest.
1 Chronicles 29-23 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Then Solomon sat on the <f>ⓒ</f>throne of the LORD as king in place of David his father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
1 Chronicles 29-24 All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
1 Chronicles 29-25 And the LORD made Solomon very <f>ⓓ</f>great in the sight of all Israel and <f>ⓔ</f>bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
1 Chronicles 29-26 <pb/>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1 Chronicles 29-27 The <f>ⓕ</f>time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 29-28 Then he died <f>ⓖ</f>at a good age, <f>ⓗ</f>full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place.
1 Chronicles 29-29 Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles <f>ⓘ</f>of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of <f>ⓙ</f>Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of <f>ⓚ</f>Gad the seer,
1 Chronicles 29-30 with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances <f>ⓛ</f>that came upon him and upon Israel and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.
Isaiah 53-1 <pb/><t><pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Who has believed what he has heard from us? <f>[1]</f> </t><t>And to whom has <f>ⓑ</f>the arm of the LORD been revealed?</t>
Isaiah 53-2 <t>For he grew up before him like a young plant, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and like a root out of dry ground; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, </t><t>and no beauty that we should desire him.</t>
Isaiah 53-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> He was despised and rejected <f>[2]</f> by men, </t><t>a man of sorrows <f>[3]</f> and acquainted with <f>[4]</f> grief; <f>[5]</f> </t><t>and as one from whom men hide their faces <f>[6]</f> </t><t>he was despised, and <f>ⓕ</f>we esteemed him not. </t>
Isaiah 53-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> Surely he has borne our griefs </t><t>and carried our sorrows; </t><t>yet we esteemed him stricken, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>smitten by God, and afflicted.</t>
Isaiah 53-5 <t><f>ⓘ</f> But he was pierced for our transgressions; </t><t>he was crushed for our iniquities; </t><t>upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>and with his wounds we are healed.</t>
Isaiah 53-6 <t><f>ⓚ</f> All we like sheep have gone astray; </t><t>we have turned — every one — to his own way; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>and the LORD has laid on him </t><t>the iniquity of us all. </t>
Isaiah 53-7 <pb/><t>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>yet he opened not his mouth; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>like a <f>ⓞ</f>lamb that is led to the slaughter, </t><t>and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, </t><t>so he opened not his mouth.</t>
Isaiah 53-8 <t>By oppression and judgment he was taken away; </t><t>and as for his generation, <f>ⓟ</f>who considered </t><t>that he was cut off out of the land of the living, </t><t>stricken for the transgression of my people?</t>
Isaiah 53-9 <t>And they made his grave with the wicked </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and with a rich man in his death, </t><t>although <f>ⓡ</f>he had done no violence, </t><t>and there was no deceit in his mouth. </t>
Isaiah 53-10 <pb/><t>Yet <f>ⓢ</f>it was the will of the LORD to crush him; </t><t>he has put him to grief; <f>[7]</f> </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>when his soul makes <f>[8]</f> an offering for guilt, </t><t>he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</t>
Isaiah 53-11 <t>Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see <f>[9]</f> and be satisfied; </t><t>by his knowledge shall <f>ⓥ</f>the righteous one, my servant, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>make many to be accounted righteous, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and he shall bear their iniquities.</t>
Isaiah 53-12 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, <f>[10]</f> </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, <f>[11]</f> </t><t>because he poured out his soul to death </t><t>and was numbered with the transgressors; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>yet he bore the sin of many, </t><t>and makes intercession for the transgressors. </t>
Galatians 6-1 <pb/>Brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>if anyone is caught in any transgression, <f>ⓑ</f>you who are spiritual should restore him in <f>ⓒ</f>a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
Galatians 6-2 <f>ⓓ</f> Bear one another's burdens, and <f>ⓔ</f>so fulfill <f>ⓕ</f>the law of Christ.
Galatians 6-3 For <f>ⓖ</f>if anyone thinks he is something, <f>ⓗ</f>when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
Galatians 6-4 But let each one <f>ⓘ</f>test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.
Galatians 6-5 For <f>ⓙ</f>each will have to bear his own load.
Galatians 6-6 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.
Galatians 6-7 <f>ⓛ</f> Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for <f>ⓜ</f>whatever one sows, that will he also reap.
Galatians 6-8 For <f>ⓝ</f>the one who sows to his own flesh <f>ⓞ</f>will from the flesh reap corruption, but <f>ⓟ</f>the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
Galatians 6-9 And <f>ⓠ</f>let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, <f>ⓡ</f>if we do not give up.
Galatians 6-10 So then, <f>ⓢ</f>as we have opportunity, let us <f>ⓣ</f>do good to everyone, and especially to those who are <f>ⓤ</f>of the household of faith.
Galatians 6-11 <pb/>See with what large letters I am writing to you <f>ⓥ</f>with my own hand.
Galatians 6-12 <f>ⓦ</f> It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh <f>ⓧ</f>who would force you to be circumcised, and only <f>ⓨ</f>in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians 6-13 For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
Galatians 6-14 But far be it from me to boast <f>ⓩ</f>except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which <f>[2]</f> the world <f>ⓐ</f>has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
Galatians 6-15 For <f>ⓑ</f>neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but <f>ⓒ</f>a new creation.
Galatians 6-16 And as for all who walk by this rule, <f>ⓓ</f>peace and mercy be upon them, and upon <f>ⓔ</f>the Israel of God.
Galatians 6-17 <pb/>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
Galatians 6-18 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be <f>ⓖ</f>with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
