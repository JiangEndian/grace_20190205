Joshua 1-1 <pb/>After the death of Moses the <f>ⓐ</f>servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' <f>ⓑ</f>assistant,
Joshua 1-2 “Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel.
Joshua 1-3 <f>ⓒ</f> Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, just as I promised to Moses.
Joshua 1-4 <f>ⓓ</f> From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory.
Joshua 1-5 <f>ⓔ</f> No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just <f>ⓕ</f>as I was with Moses, so <f>ⓖ</f>I will be with you. <f>ⓗ</f>I will not leave you or forsake you.
Joshua 1-6 <f>ⓘ</f> Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.
Joshua 1-7 Only be strong and <f>ⓙ</f>very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law <f>ⓚ</f>that Moses my servant commanded you. <f>ⓛ</f>Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success <f>[1]</f> wherever you go.
Joshua 1-8 This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but <f>ⓜ</f>you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.
Joshua 1-9 Have I not commanded you? <f>ⓝ</f>Be strong and courageous. <f>ⓞ</f>Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”
Joshua 1-10 <pb/>And Joshua commanded the <f>ⓟ</f>officers of the people,
Joshua 1-11 “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, ‘Prepare your provisions, for <f>ⓠ</f>within three days <f>ⓡ</f>you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.’”
Joshua 1-12 <pb/>And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,
Joshua 1-13 “Remember the word that <f>ⓢ</f>Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, ‘The LORD your God is providing you a place of rest and will give you this land.’
Joshua 1-14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brothers and shall help them,
Joshua 1-15 <f>ⓣ</f> until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they also take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. <f>ⓤ</f>Then you shall return to the land of your possession and shall possess it, the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.”
Joshua 1-16 <pb/>And they answered Joshua, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
Joshua 1-17 Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God <f>ⓥ</f>be with you, as he was with Moses!
Joshua 1-18 Whoever rebels against your commandment and disobeys your words, whatever you command him, shall be put to death. <f>ⓦ</f>Only be strong and courageous.”
Psalm 75-1 <f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f> <pb/><t>We give thanks to you, O God; </t><t>we give thanks, for your name is <f>ⓒ</f>near. </t><t>We <f>[1]</f> recount your wondrous deeds. </t>
Psalm 75-2 <pb/><t>“At <f>ⓓ</f>the set time that I appoint </t><t>I will judge <f>ⓔ</f>with equity.</t>
Psalm 75-3 <t>When the earth <f>ⓕ</f>totters, and all its inhabitants, </t><t>it is I who keep steady its <f>ⓖ</f>pillars. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
Psalm 75-4 <t>I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’ </t><t>and to the wicked, <f>ⓗ</f>‘Do not lift up your horn;</t>
Psalm 75-5 <t>do not lift up your horn on high, </t><t>or speak with haughty neck.’” </t>
Psalm 75-6 <pb/><t>For not from the east or from the west </t><t>and not from the wilderness comes <f>ⓘ</f>lifting up,</t>
Psalm 75-7 <t>but it is <f>ⓙ</f>God who executes judgment, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>putting down one and lifting up another.</t>
Psalm 75-8 <t><f>ⓛ</f> For in the hand of the LORD there is <f>ⓜ</f>a cup </t><t>with foaming wine, <f>ⓝ</f>well mixed, </t><t>and he pours out from it, </t><t>and all the wicked of the earth </t><t>shall <f>ⓞ</f>drain it down to the dregs. </t>
Psalm 75-9 <pb/><t>But I will declare it forever; </t><t>I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</t>
Psalm 75-10 <t><f>ⓟ</f> All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. </t>
Zechariah 7-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is <f>ⓑ</f>Chislev.
Zechariah 7-2 Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men <f>ⓒ</f>to entreat the favor of the LORD,
Zechariah 7-3 <f>ⓓ</f> saying to the priests of the house of the LORD of hosts and <f>ⓔ</f>the prophets, “Should I weep and <f>ⓕ</f>abstain in <f>ⓖ</f>the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”
Zechariah 7-4 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me:
Zechariah 7-5 “Say to all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in <f>ⓗ</f>the fifth month and in <f>ⓘ</f>the seventh, for these <f>ⓙ</f>seventy years, <f>ⓚ</f>was it <f>ⓛ</f>for me that you fasted?
Zechariah 7-6 <f>ⓜ</f> And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?
Zechariah 7-7 <f>ⓝ</f> Were not these the words that the LORD proclaimed <f>ⓞ</f>by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, <f>ⓟ</f>with her cities around her, and the <f>ⓠ</f>South and the <f>ⓡ</f>lowland were inhabited?’”
Zechariah 7-8 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
Zechariah 7-9 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓢ</f>Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another,
Zechariah 7-10 <f>ⓣ</f> do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, <f>ⓤ</f>or the poor, and <f>ⓥ</f>let none of you devise evil against another in your heart.”
Zechariah 7-11 But <f>ⓦ</f>they refused to pay attention <f>ⓧ</f>and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear. <f>[1]</f>
Zechariah 7-12 <f>ⓨ</f> They made their hearts diamond-hard <f>ⓩ</f>lest they should hear the law and the words that the LORD of hosts had sent <f>ⓐ</f>by his Spirit through <f>ⓑ</f>the former prophets. <f>ⓒ</f>Therefore great anger came from the LORD of hosts.
Zechariah 7-13 <f>ⓓ</f> “As I <f>[2]</f> called, and they would not hear, <f>ⓔ</f>so they called, and I would not hear,” says the LORD of hosts,
Zechariah 7-14 <f>ⓕ</f> “and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all <f>ⓖ</f>the nations that they had not known. <f>ⓗ</f>Thus the land they left was desolate, <f>ⓘ</f>so that no one went to and fro, <f>ⓙ</f>and the pleasant land was made desolate.”
