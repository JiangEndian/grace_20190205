Exodus 4-1 <pb/>Then Moses answered, “But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘The LORD did not appear to you.’”
Exodus 4-2 The LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, <f>ⓐ</f>“A staff.”
Exodus 4-3 And he said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses ran from it.
Exodus 4-4 But the LORD said to Moses, “Put out your hand and catch it by the tail” — so he put out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand —
Exodus 4-5 “that they may <f>ⓑ</f>believe that the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”
Exodus 4-6 Again, the LORD said to him, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” <f>[1]</f> And he put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was <f>ⓓ</f>leprous <f>[2]</f> like snow.
Exodus 4-7 Then God said, “Put your hand back inside your cloak.” So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, behold, <f>ⓔ</f>it was restored like the rest of his flesh.
Exodus 4-8 “If they will not believe you,” God said, “or listen to the first sign, they may believe the latter sign.
Exodus 4-9 If they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you shall take from the Nile <f>ⓕ</f>will become blood on the dry ground.”
Exodus 4-10 <pb/>But Moses said to the LORD, “Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but <f>ⓖ</f>I am slow of speech and of tongue.”
Exodus 4-11 Then the LORD said to him, “Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
Exodus 4-12 Now therefore go, and <f>ⓗ</f>I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.”
Exodus 4-13 But he said, “Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.”
Exodus 4-14 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, “Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, <f>ⓘ</f>he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
Exodus 4-15 <f>ⓙ</f> You shall speak to him and <f>ⓚ</f>put the words in his mouth, and <f>ⓛ</f>I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do.
Exodus 4-16 <f>ⓜ</f> He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and <f>ⓝ</f>you shall be as God to him.
Exodus 4-17 And take in your hand <f>ⓞ</f>this staff, with which you shall do the signs.”
Exodus 4-18 <pb/>Moses went back to <f>ⓟ</f>Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”
Exodus 4-19 And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for <f>ⓠ</f>all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”
Exodus 4-20 So Moses took <f>ⓡ</f>his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took <f>ⓢ</f>the staff of God in his hand.
Exodus 4-21 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the <f>ⓣ</f>miracles that I have put in your power. But <f>ⓤ</f>I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.
Exodus 4-22 Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD, <f>ⓥ</f>Israel is my <f>ⓦ</f>firstborn son,
Exodus 4-23 and I say to you, “Let my son go that he may serve me.” If you refuse to let him go, behold, I <f>ⓧ</f>will kill your firstborn son.’”
Exodus 4-24 <pb/>At a lodging place on the way <f>ⓨ</f>the LORD met him and <f>ⓩ</f>sought to put him to death.
Exodus 4-25 Then <f>ⓐ</f>Zipporah took a <f>ⓑ</f>flint and cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' <f>[3]</f> feet with it and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!”
Exodus 4-26 So he let him alone. It was then that she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.
Exodus 4-27 <pb/>The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness <f>ⓒ</f>to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the <f>ⓓ</f>mountain of God and kissed him.
Exodus 4-28 And Moses <f>ⓔ</f>told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak, and all <f>ⓕ</f>the signs that he had commanded him to do.
Exodus 4-29 Then Moses and Aaron <f>ⓖ</f>went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel.
Exodus 4-30 <f>ⓗ</f> Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.
Exodus 4-31 And the people <f>ⓘ</f>believed; and when they heard that the LORD had <f>ⓙ</f>visited the people of Israel and that he had <f>ⓚ</f>seen their affliction, <f>ⓛ</f>they bowed their heads and worshiped.
Nehemiah 6-1 <pb/>Now when <f>ⓐ</f>Sanballat and Tobiah and <f>ⓑ</f>Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (<f>ⓒ</f>although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),
Nehemiah 6-2 Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come and let us meet together at Hakkephirim in the plain of <f>ⓓ</f>Ono.” But they intended to do me harm.
Nehemiah 6-3 And I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”
Nehemiah 6-4 And they sent to me four times in this way, and I answered them in the same manner.
Nehemiah 6-5 In the same way Sanballat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.
Nehemiah 6-6 In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Geshem <f>[1]</f> also says it, that you and <f>ⓔ</f>the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall. And according to these reports you wish to become their king.
Nehemiah 6-7 And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, ‘There is a king in Judah.’ And now the king will hear of these reports. So now come and let us take counsel together.”
Nehemiah 6-8 Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind.”
Nehemiah 6-9 For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done.” But now, O God, <f>[2]</f> strengthen my hands.
Nehemiah 6-10 <pb/>Now when I went into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was <f>ⓕ</f>confined to his home, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple. Let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. They are coming to kill you by night.”
Nehemiah 6-11 But I said, “Should such a man as I run away? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live? <f>[3]</f> I will not go in.”
Nehemiah 6-12 And I understood and saw that God had not sent him, <f>ⓖ</f>but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
Nehemiah 6-13 For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me a bad name in order to taunt me.
Nehemiah 6-14 <f>ⓗ</f> Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also <f>ⓘ</f>the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.
Nehemiah 6-15 <pb/>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.
Nehemiah 6-16 And <f>ⓙ</f>when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations around us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem, <f>ⓚ</f>for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.
Nehemiah 6-17 Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them.
Nehemiah 6-18 For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of <f>ⓛ</f>Arah: and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of <f>ⓜ</f>Meshullam the son of Berechiah as his wife.
Nehemiah 6-19 Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid.
Jeremiah 39-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and besieged it.
Jeremiah 39-2 In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.
Jeremiah 39-3 Then all <f>ⓑ</f>the officials of the king of Babylon came <f>ⓒ</f>and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sar-ezer of Samgar, Nebu-sar-sekim <f>ⓓ</f>the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah 39-4 When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward <f>ⓔ</f>the Arabah.
Jeremiah 39-5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in <f>ⓕ</f>the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at <f>ⓖ</f>Riblah, in the land of Hamath; <f>ⓗ</f>and he passed sentence on him.
Jeremiah 39-6 The king of Babylon <f>ⓘ</f>slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at <f>ⓙ</f>Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon <f>ⓚ</f>slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah 39-7 <f>ⓛ</f> He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon.
Jeremiah 39-8 <f>ⓜ</f> The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the house of the people, <f>ⓝ</f>and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 39-9 Then <f>ⓞ</f>Nebuzaradan, the <f>ⓟ</f>captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, <f>ⓠ</f>those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained.
Jeremiah 39-10 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, <f>ⓡ</f>left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
Jeremiah 39-11 <pb/>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,
Jeremiah 39-12 <f>ⓢ</f> “Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.”
Jeremiah 39-13 So <f>ⓣ</f>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, <f>ⓤ</f>and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
Jeremiah 39-14 sent and took Jeremiah from <f>ⓥ</f>the court of the guard. They entrusted him to <f>ⓦ</f>Gedaliah the son of <f>ⓧ</f>Ahikam, son of <f>ⓨ</f>Shaphan, that he should take him home. So <f>ⓩ</f>he lived among the people.
Jeremiah 39-15 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah <f>ⓐ</f>while he was shut up in the court of the guard:
Jeremiah 39-16 “Go, and say to <f>ⓑ</f>Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓒ</f>Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and <f>ⓓ</f>not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day.
Jeremiah 39-17 But I will deliver you on that day, declares the LORD, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men <f>ⓔ</f>of whom you are afraid.
Jeremiah 39-18 For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall have your <f>ⓕ</f>life as a prize of war, <f>ⓖ</f>because you have put your trust in me, declares the LORD.’”
James 4-1 <pb/>What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions <f>[1]</f> are <f>ⓐ</f>at war within you? <f>[2]</f>
James 4-2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.
James 4-3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask <f>ⓑ</f>wrongly, to spend it on your passions.
James 4-4 <f>ⓒ</f> You adulterous people! <f>[3]</f> Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? <f>ⓓ</f>Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
James 4-5 Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit <f>ⓔ</f>that he has made to dwell in us”?
James 4-6 But <f>ⓕ</f>he gives more grace. Therefore it says, <f>ⓖ</f>“God opposes the proud but <f>ⓗ</f>gives grace to the humble.”
James 4-7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. <f>ⓘ</f>Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
James 4-8 <f>ⓙ</f> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. <f>ⓚ</f>Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and <f>ⓛ</f>purify your hearts, <f>ⓜ</f>you double-minded.
James 4-9 <f>ⓝ</f> Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
James 4-10 <f>ⓞ</f> Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
James 4-11 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. <f>[4]</f> The one who speaks against a brother or <f>ⓠ</f>judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
James 4-12 There is only <f>ⓡ</f>one lawgiver and <f>ⓢ</f>judge, he who is able to save and <f>ⓣ</f>to destroy. But <f>ⓤ</f>who are you to judge your neighbor?
James 4-13 <pb/>Come now, you who say, <f>ⓥ</f>“Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit” —
James 4-14 yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For <f>ⓦ</f>you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.
James 4-15 Instead you ought to say, <f>ⓧ</f>“If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”
James 4-16 As it is, you boast in your arrogance. <f>ⓨ</f>All such boasting is evil.
James 4-17 <f>ⓩ</f> So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.
