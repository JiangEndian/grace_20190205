25-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
25-2 “Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you come into <f>ⓑ</f>the land that I give you, the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD.
25-3 For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its fruits,
25-4 but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
25-5 <f>ⓒ</f> You shall not reap what grows of itself in your harvest, or gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
25-6 The Sabbath of the land <f>[1]</f> shall provide food for you, for yourself and for your male and female slaves <f>[2]</f> and for your hired worker and the sojourner who lives with you,
25-7 and for your cattle and for the wild animals that are in your land: <f>ⓓ</f>all its yield shall be for food.
25-8 <pb/>“You shall count seven weeks <f>[3]</f> of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall give you forty-nine years.
25-9 Then you shall sound <f>ⓔ</f>the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. <f>ⓕ</f>On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.
25-10 And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and <f>ⓖ</f>proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of <f>ⓗ</f>you shall return to his clan.
25-11 That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; in it <f>ⓘ</f>you shall neither sow nor reap <f>ⓙ</f>what grows of itself nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines.
25-12 For it is a jubilee. It shall be holy to you. <f>ⓚ</f>You may eat the produce of the field. <f>[4]</f>
25-13 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property.
25-14 And if you make a sale to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, <f>ⓜ</f>you shall not wrong one another.
25-15 <f>ⓝ</f> You shall pay your neighbor according to the number of years after the jubilee, and he shall sell to you according to the number of years for crops.
25-16 If the years are many, you shall increase the price, and if the years are few, you shall reduce the price, for it is the number of the crops that he is selling to you.
25-17 <f>ⓞ</f> You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God, for I am the LORD your God.
25-18 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> “Therefore you shall do my statutes and keep my rules and perform them, and then <f>ⓠ</f>you will dwell in the land securely.
25-19 <f>ⓡ</f> The land will yield its fruit, and <f>ⓢ</f>you will eat your fill <f>ⓣ</f>and dwell in it securely.
25-20 And if you say, <f>ⓤ</f>‘What shall we eat in the seventh year, if <f>ⓥ</f>we may not sow or gather in our crop?’
25-21 I will <f>ⓦ</f>command my blessing on you in the sixth year, so that it will produce a crop sufficient for three years.
25-22 <f>ⓧ</f> When you sow in the eighth year, you will be eating some of <f>ⓨ</f>the old crop; you shall eat the old until the ninth year, when its crop arrives.
25-23 <pb/>“The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for <f>ⓩ</f>the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me.
25-24 And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land.
25-25 <pb/>“If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, <f>ⓐ</f>then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.
25-26 If a man has no one to redeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it,
25-27 let <f>ⓑ</f>him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property.
25-28 But if he does not have sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall <f>ⓒ</f>be released, and <f>ⓓ</f>he shall return to his property.
25-29 <pb/>“If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, he may redeem it within a year of its sale. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.
25-30 If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house in the walled city shall belong in perpetuity to the buyer, throughout his generations; <f>ⓔ</f>it shall not be released in the jubilee.
25-31 But the houses of the villages that have no wall around them shall be classified with the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and <f>ⓕ</f>they shall be released in the jubilee.
25-32 As for <f>ⓖ</f>the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem at any time the houses in the cities they possess.
25-33 And if one of the Levites exercises his right of redemption, then the house that was sold in a city they possess shall be released in the jubilee. For the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the people of Israel.
25-34 But the fields <f>ⓗ</f>of pastureland belonging to their cities may not be sold, for that is their possession forever.
25-35 <pb/>“If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, <f>ⓘ</f>you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you.
25-36 <f>ⓙ</f> Take no interest from him or profit, but <f>ⓚ</f>fear your God, that your brother may live beside you.
25-37 <f>ⓛ</f> You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
25-38 <f>ⓜ</f> I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
25-39 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> “If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave:
25-40 he shall be with you as a hired worker and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee.
25-41 <f>ⓞ</f> Then he shall go out from you, <f>ⓟ</f>he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return <f>ⓠ</f>to the possession of his fathers.
25-42 For they are <f>ⓡ</f>my servants, <f>[5]</f> whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves.
25-43 <f>ⓢ</f> You shall not rule over him <f>ⓣ</f>ruthlessly but <f>ⓤ</f>shall fear your God.
25-44 As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you.
25-45 <f>ⓥ</f> You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their clans that are with you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property.
25-46 You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You may make slaves of them, but over your brothers the people of Israel <f>ⓦ</f>you shall not rule, one over another ruthlessly.
25-47 <pb/>“If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich, and <f>ⓧ</f>your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you or to a member of the stranger's clan,
25-48 then after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him,
25-49 or his uncle or his cousin may <f>ⓨ</f>redeem him, or a close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he <f>ⓩ</f>grows rich he may redeem himself.
25-50 He shall calculate with his buyer from the year when he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall vary with the number of years. The time he was with his owner shall be <f>ⓐ</f>rated as the time of a hired worker.
25-51 If there are still many years left, he shall pay proportionately for his redemption some of his sale price.
25-52 If there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee, he shall calculate and pay for his redemption in proportion to his years of service.
25-53 He shall treat him as a worker hired year by year. <f>ⓑ</f>He shall not rule ruthlessly over him in your sight.
25-54 And if he is not redeemed by these means, then <f>ⓒ</f>he and his children with him shall be released in the year of jubilee.
25-55 For it is <f>ⓓ</f>to me that the people of Israel are servants. <f>[6]</f> They are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
2-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Why do <f>ⓑ</f>the nations rage <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and the peoples plot in vain?</t>
2-2 <t>The kings of the earth set themselves, </t><t>and the rulers take counsel together, </t><t>against the LORD and against his <f>ⓒ</f>Anointed, saying,</t>
2-3 <t>“Let us <f>ⓓ</f>burst their bonds apart </t><t>and cast away their cords from us.” </t>
2-4 <pb/><t>He who <f>ⓔ</f>sits in the heavens <f>ⓕ</f>laughs; </t><t>the Lord holds them in derision.</t>
2-5 <t>Then he will speak to them in his <f>ⓖ</f>wrath, </t><t>and terrify them in his fury, saying,</t>
2-6 <t>“As for me, I have <f>ⓗ</f>set my King </t><t>on <f>ⓘ</f>Zion, my <f>ⓙ</f>holy hill.” </t>
2-7 <pb/><t>I will tell of the decree: </t><t>The LORD said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“You are my Son; </t><t>today I have begotten you.</t>
2-8 <t>Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>the ends of the earth your possession.</t>
2-9 <t>You shall <f>ⓜ</f>break <f>[2]</f> them with <f>ⓝ</f>a rod of iron </t><t>and dash them in pieces like <f>ⓞ</f>a potter's vessel.” </t>
2-10 <pb/><t>Now therefore, O kings, be wise; </t><t>be warned, O rulers of the earth.</t>
2-11 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Serve the LORD with <f>ⓠ</f>fear, </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>rejoice with <f>ⓢ</f>trembling.</t>
2-12 <t><f>ⓣ</f> Kiss <f>ⓤ</f>the Son, </t><t>lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, </t><t>for his <f>ⓥ</f>wrath is quickly kindled. </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>Blessed are all who take refuge in him. </t>
43-1 <pb/>Then he led me to <f>ⓐ</f>the gate, the gate facing east.
43-2 And behold, <f>ⓑ</f>the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And <f>ⓒ</f>the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and <f>ⓓ</f>the earth shone with his glory.
43-3 And <f>ⓔ</f>the vision I saw was just like the vision that I had seen <f>ⓕ</f>when he <f>[1]</f> came to destroy the city, and just like <f>ⓖ</f>the vision that I had seen <f>ⓗ</f>by the Chebar canal. And <f>ⓘ</f>I fell on my face.
43-4 As <f>ⓙ</f>the glory of the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>entered the temple by the gate facing east,
43-5 <f>ⓛ</f> the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into <f>ⓜ</f>the inner court; and behold, <f>ⓝ</f>the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
43-6 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> While the man was standing beside me, <f>ⓟ</f>I heard one speaking to me out of the temple,
43-7 and he said to me, <f>ⓠ</f>“Son of man, this is <f>ⓡ</f>the place of my throne and <f>ⓢ</f>the place of the soles of my feet, <f>ⓣ</f>where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more <f>ⓤ</f>defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoring and by the dead bodies <f>[2]</f> of their kings at their high places, <f>[3]</f>
43-8 by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with <f>ⓥ</f>only a wall between me and them. They have <f>ⓦ</f>defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger.
43-9 Now let them put away their whoring and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, <f>ⓧ</f>and I will dwell in their midst forever.
43-10 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓨ</f>son of man, <f>ⓩ</f>describe to the house of Israel the temple, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the plan.
43-11 And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, <f>ⓐ</f>make known to them the design of the temple, its arrangement, <f>ⓑ</f>its exits and its entrances, that is, its whole design; and make known to them as well all its statutes and its whole design and all its laws, and write it down <f>ⓒ</f>in their sight, so that they may observe all its laws and all its statutes and carry them out.
43-12 This is the law of the temple: the whole territory on the top of <f>ⓓ</f>the mountain <f>ⓔ</f>all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.
43-13 <pb/>“These are the measurements of <f>ⓕ</f>the altar by cubits (the cubit being <f>ⓖ</f>a cubit and a handbreadth): <f>[4]</f> its base shall be one cubit high <f>[5]</f> and one cubit broad, with a rim of one span <f>[6]</f> around its edge. And this shall be the height of the altar:
43-14 from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit;
43-15 and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, <f>ⓗ</f>four horns.
43-16 The altar hearth shall be <f>ⓘ</f>square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad.
43-17 The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit all around. <f>ⓙ</f>The steps of the altar shall face east.”
43-18 <pb/>And he said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon it and <f>ⓛ</f>for throwing blood against it,
43-19 you shall give to <f>ⓜ</f>the Levitical priests <f>ⓝ</f>of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, declares the Lord GOD, <f>ⓞ</f>a bull from the herd for a sin offering.
43-20 And <f>ⓟ</f>you shall take some of its blood and put it on <f>ⓠ</f>the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the ledge and upon <f>ⓡ</f>the rim all around. <f>ⓢ</f>Thus you shall purify the altar and make atonement for it.
43-21 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and <f>ⓣ</f>it shall be burned in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area.
43-22 And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be purified, as it was purified with the bull.
43-23 When you have finished <f>ⓤ</f>purifying it, you shall offer a bull from the herd without blemish and <f>ⓥ</f>a ram from the flock without blemish.
43-24 You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests <f>ⓦ</f>shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD.
43-25 <f>ⓧ</f> For seven days you shall provide daily a male goat for a sin offering; also, a bull from the herd and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided.
43-26 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and so consecrate it. <f>[7]</f>
43-27 And when they have completed these days, then <f>ⓨ</f>from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer on the altar your burnt offerings and your <f>ⓩ</f>peace offerings, and <f>ⓐ</f>I will accept you, declares the Lord GOD.”
