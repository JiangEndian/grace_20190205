2 Samuel 12-1 <pb/>And the LORD sent <f>ⓐ</f>Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, <f>ⓑ</f>“There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.
2 Samuel 12-2 The rich man had very many flocks and herds,
2 Samuel 12-3 but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, <f>[1]</f> and it was like a daughter to him.
2 Samuel 12-4 Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”
2 Samuel 12-5 Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, <f>ⓒ</f>“As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die,
2 Samuel 12-6 and he shall restore the lamb <f>ⓓ</f>fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.”
2 Samuel 12-7 <pb/>Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓔ</f>‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
2 Samuel 12-8 And I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your arms and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more.
2 Samuel 12-9 <f>ⓕ</f> Why have you despised the word of the LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>to do what is evil in his sight? <f>ⓗ</f>You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and <f>ⓘ</f>have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
2 Samuel 12-10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’
2 Samuel 12-11 Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
2 Samuel 12-12 For you did it secretly, <f>ⓙ</f>but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.’”
2 Samuel 12-13 <f>ⓚ</f> David said to Nathan, <f>ⓛ</f>“I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, <f>ⓜ</f>“The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
2 Samuel 12-14 Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly <f>ⓝ</f>scorned the LORD, <f>[2]</f> the child who is born to you shall die.”
2 Samuel 12-15 Then Nathan went to his house. <pb/><e>David's Child Dies</e> </pb> <pb/>And the LORD afflicted the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and he became sick.
2 Samuel 12-16 David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David <f>ⓞ</f>fasted and went in <f>ⓟ</f>and lay all night on the ground.
2 Samuel 12-17 And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.
2 Samuel 12-18 On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.”
2 Samuel 12-19 But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They said, “He is dead.”
2 Samuel 12-20 Then David arose from the earth <f>ⓠ</f>and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the LORD <f>ⓡ</f>and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate.
2 Samuel 12-21 Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.”
2 Samuel 12-22 He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, <f>ⓢ</f>‘Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?’
2 Samuel 12-23 But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, <f>ⓣ</f>but he will not return to me.”
2 Samuel 12-24 <pb/>Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and <f>ⓤ</f>she bore a son, and he called his name <f>ⓥ</f>Solomon. And the LORD loved him
2 Samuel 12-25 and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, <f>[3]</f> because of the LORD.
2 Samuel 12-26 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Now Joab <f>ⓧ</f>fought against <f>ⓨ</f>Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city.
2 Samuel 12-27 And Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters.
2 Samuel 12-28 Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name.”
2 Samuel 12-29 So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it.
2 Samuel 12-30 And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent <f>[4]</f> of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
2 Samuel 12-31 And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at <f>[5]</f> the brick kilns. And thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

John 12-1 <pb/>Six days before <f>ⓐ</f>the Passover, <f>ⓑ</f>Jesus therefore came to Bethany, <f>ⓒ</f>where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
John 12-2 So they gave a dinner for him there. <f>ⓓ</f>Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table.
John 12-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Mary therefore took a pound <f>[1]</f> of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
John 12-4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said,
John 12-5 “Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓕ</f>given to the poor?”
John 12-6 He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and <f>ⓖ</f>having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it.
John 12-7 Jesus said, <J>“Leave her alone, so that she may keep it <f>[3]</f> for the day of my burial.</J>
John 12-8 <J>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.”</J>
John 12-9 <pb/>When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus <f>[4]</f> was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, <f>ⓗ</f>whom he had raised from the dead.
John 12-10 <f>ⓘ</f> So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well,
John 12-11 because <f>ⓙ</f>on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.
John 12-12 <pb/>The next day <f>ⓚ</f>the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
John 12-13 So they took branches of <f>ⓛ</f>palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, <f>ⓜ</f>“Hosanna! Blessed is <f>ⓝ</f>he who comes in the name of the Lord, even <f>ⓞ</f>the King of Israel!”
John 12-14 And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,
John 12-15 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> “Fear not, daughter of Zion; </t><t>behold, your king is coming, </t><t>sitting on a donkey's colt!” </t>
John 12-16 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> His disciples did not understand these things at first, but <f>ⓡ</f>when Jesus was glorified, then <f>ⓢ</f>they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.
John 12-17 <f>ⓣ</f> The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness.
John 12-18 The reason why the crowd went to meet him <f>ⓤ</f>was that they heard he had done this sign.
John 12-19 So the Pharisees said to one another, <f>ⓥ</f>“You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, <f>ⓦ</f>the world has gone after him.”
John 12-20 <pb/>Now <f>ⓧ</f>among those who went up to worship at the feast were some <f>ⓨ</f>Greeks.
John 12-21 So these came to <f>ⓩ</f>Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”
John 12-22 Philip went and told <f>ⓐ</f>Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
John 12-23 And Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“The hour has come <f>ⓒ</f>for the Son of Man to be glorified.</J>
John 12-24 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓓ</f>unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</J>
John 12-25 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Whoever loves his life loses it, and <f>ⓕ</f>whoever <f>ⓖ</f>hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</J>
John 12-26 <J>If anyone serves me, he must <f>ⓗ</f>follow me; and <f>ⓘ</f>where I am, there will my servant be also. <f>ⓙ</f>If anyone serves me, <f>ⓚ</f>the Father will honor him.</J>
John 12-27 <pb/><J><f>ⓛ</f> “Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? ‘Father, <f>ⓜ</f>save me from <f>ⓝ</f>this hour’? But <f>ⓞ</f>for this purpose I have come to <f>ⓟ</f>this hour.</J>
John 12-28 <J>Father, glorify your name.”</J> Then <f>ⓠ</f>a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”
John 12-29 The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, <f>ⓡ</f>“An angel has spoken to him.”
John 12-30 Jesus answered, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“This voice has come for your sake, not mine.</J>
John 12-31 <J><f>ⓣ</f> Now is the judgment of this world; now will <f>ⓤ</f>the ruler of this world <f>ⓥ</f>be cast out.</J>
John 12-32 <J>And I, <f>ⓦ</f>when I am lifted up from the earth, <f>ⓧ</f>will draw <f>ⓨ</f>all people to myself.”</J>
John 12-33 He said this <f>ⓩ</f>to show by what kind of death he was going to die.
John 12-34 So the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the Law that <f>ⓐ</f>the Christ remains forever. How can you say that <f>ⓑ</f>the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”
John 12-35 So Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“The light is among you <f>ⓓ</f>for a little while longer. <f>ⓔ</f>Walk while you have the light, lest darkness <f>ⓕ</f>overtake you. <f>ⓖ</f>The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</J>
John 12-36 <J>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become <f>ⓗ</f>sons of light.” <pb/><e>The Unbelief of the People</e> </pb></J> <pb/>When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them.
John 12-37 Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him,
John 12-38 <f>ⓘ</f> so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, </t><t>and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” </t>
John 12-39 <pb/>Therefore they <f>ⓚ</f>could not believe. For again Isaiah said,
John 12-40 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> “He has blinded their eyes </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>hardened their heart, </t><t>lest they see with their eyes, </t><t>and understand with their heart, and turn, </t><t>and I would heal them.” </t>
John 12-41 <pb/>Isaiah said these things because <f>ⓝ</f>he saw his glory and <f>ⓞ</f>spoke of him.
John 12-42 Nevertheless, <f>ⓟ</f>many even of the authorities believed in him, but <f>ⓠ</f>for fear of the Pharisees they did not <f>ⓡ</f>confess it, so that they would not be <f>ⓢ</f>put out of the synagogue;
John 12-43 <f>ⓣ</f> for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God.
John 12-44 <pb/>And Jesus cried out and said, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but <f>ⓥ</f>in him who sent me.</J>
John 12-45 <J>And <f>ⓦ</f>whoever <f>ⓧ</f>sees me sees him who sent me.</J>
John 12-46 <J><f>ⓨ</f> I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.</J>
John 12-47 <J>If anyone <f>ⓩ</f>hears my words and does not keep them, <f>ⓐ</f>I do not judge him; for <f>ⓑ</f>I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</J>
John 12-48 <J><f>ⓒ</f> The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; <f>ⓓ</f>the word that I have spoken will judge him <f>ⓔ</f>on the last day.</J>
John 12-49 <J>For <f>ⓕ</f>I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father <f>ⓖ</f>who sent me has himself given me <f>ⓗ</f>a commandment — what to say and what to speak.</J>
John 12-50 <J>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me.”</J>
