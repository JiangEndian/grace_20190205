27-1 <pb/>This is the number of the people of Israel, the heads of fathers' houses, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and their officers who served the king in all matters concerning the divisions that came and went, month after month throughout the year, each division numbering 24,000:

27-23 David did not count those below twenty years of age, for the <f>ⓢ</f>LORD had promised to make Israel as many as the stars of heaven.
27-24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count, but <f>ⓣ</f>did not finish. Yet <f>ⓤ</f>wrath came upon Israel for this, and the number was not entered in the chronicles of King David.
27-25 <pb/>Over the king's treasuries was <f>ⓥ</f>Azmaveth the son of Adiel; and over the treasuries in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah;
27-26 and over those who did the work of the field for tilling the soil was Ezri the son of Chelub;
27-27 and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite; and over the produce of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite.

27-30 Over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite; and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite. Over the flocks was Jaziz the <f>ⓨ</f>Hagrite.
27-31 All these were stewards of King David's property.
27-32 <pb/>Jonathan, David's uncle, was a counselor, being a man of understanding and a scribe. He and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni attended the king's sons.
27-33 <f>ⓩ</f> Ahithophel was the <f>ⓐ</f>king's counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend.
27-34 Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Benaiah, and <f>ⓒ</f>Abiathar. Joab was <f>ⓓ</f>commander of the king's army.

51-2 <t>Look to Abraham your father </t><t>and to Sarah who bore you; </t><t>for <f>ⓑ</f>he was but one when I called him, </t><t>that I might bless him and multiply him.</t>
51-3 <t>For the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>comforts Zion; </t><t>he comforts all her waste places </t><t>and makes her wilderness like <f>ⓓ</f>Eden, </t><t>her desert like <f>ⓔ</f>the garden of the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>joy and gladness will be found in her, </t><t>thanksgiving and the voice of song. </t>

51-10 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Was it not you who dried up the sea, </t><t>the waters of the great deep, </t><t>who made the depths of the sea a way </t><t>for the redeemed to pass over?</t>
51-11 <t><f>ⓩ</f> And the ransomed of the LORD shall return </t><t>and come to Zion with singing; </t><t>everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; </t><t>they shall obtain gladness and joy, </t><t>and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. </t>

51-13 <t>and have forgotten the LORD, your Maker, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>who stretched out the heavens </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>laid the foundations of the earth, </t><t>and you fear continually all the day </t><t>because of the wrath of <f>ⓕ</f>the oppressor, </t><t>when he sets himself to destroy? </t><t>And where is the wrath of <f>ⓖ</f>the oppressor?</t>

51-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> Wake yourself, wake yourself, </t><t>stand up, O Jerusalem, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD </t><t>the cup of his wrath, </t><t>who have drunk to the dregs </t><t>the bowl, <f>ⓠ</f>the cup of staggering.</t>

51-19 <t><f>ⓢ</f> These two things have happened to you — </t><t>who will console you? — </t><t>devastation and destruction, famine and sword; </t><t>who will comfort you? <f>[4]</f></t>

51-21 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted, </t><t>who are drunk, but not with wine:</t>
51-22 <t>Thus says your Lord, the LORD, </t><t>your God <f>ⓧ</f>who pleads the cause of his people: </t><t>“Behold, I have taken from your hand <f>ⓨ</f>the cup of staggering; </t><t>the bowl of my wrath you shall drink no more;</t>

4-1 <pb/>I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, <f>[1]</f> though he is the owner of everything,
4-2 but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.
4-3 In the same way we also, when we were children, <f>ⓐ</f>were enslaved to the elementary principles <f>[2]</f> of the world.
4-4 But <f>ⓑ</f>when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, <f>ⓒ</f>born <f>ⓓ</f>of woman, born <f>ⓔ</f>under the law,
4-5 <f>ⓕ</f> to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive <f>ⓖ</f>adoption as sons.
4-6 And because you are sons, God has sent <f>ⓗ</f>the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”
4-7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then <f>ⓘ</f>an heir through God.
4-8 <pb/>Formerly, when you <f>ⓙ</f>did not know God, you <f>ⓚ</f>were enslaved to those that by nature <f>ⓛ</f>are not gods.
4-9 But now that you have come to know God, or rather <f>ⓜ</f>to be known by God, <f>ⓝ</f>how can you turn back again to <f>ⓞ</f>the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?
4-10 <f>ⓟ</f> You observe days and months and seasons and years!
4-11 I am afraid <f>ⓠ</f>I may have labored over you in vain.
4-12 <pb/>Brothers, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. <f>ⓢ</f>You did me no wrong.
4-13 You know it was <f>ⓣ</f>because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you <f>ⓤ</f>at first,
4-14 and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me <f>ⓥ</f>as an angel of God, <f>ⓦ</f>as Christ Jesus.
4-15 What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.
4-16 Have I then become your enemy by <f>ⓧ</f>telling you the truth? <f>[4]</f>
4-17 They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them.
4-18 It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and <f>ⓨ</f>not only when I am present with you,
4-19 <f>ⓩ</f> my little children, <f>ⓐ</f>for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ <f>ⓑ</f>is formed in you!
4-20 I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
4-21 <pb/>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
4-22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, <f>ⓒ</f>one by a slave woman and <f>ⓓ</f>one by a free woman.
4-23 But <f>ⓔ</f>the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while <f>ⓕ</f>the son of the free woman was born through promise.
4-24 Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two <f>ⓖ</f>covenants. <f>ⓗ</f>One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
4-25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; <f>[5]</f> she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
4-26 But <f>ⓘ</f>the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
4-27 For it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; </t><t>break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! </t><t>For the children of the desolate one will be more </t><t>than those of the one who has a husband.” </t>
4-28 <pb/>Now you, <f>[6]</f> brothers, <f>ⓚ</f>like Isaac, <f>ⓛ</f>are children of promise.
4-29 But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh <f>ⓜ</f>persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, <f>ⓝ</f>so also it is now.
4-30 But what does the Scripture say? <f>ⓞ</f>“Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.”
4-31 So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but <f>ⓟ</f>of the free woman.
