Genesis 3-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. <pb/>He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You <f>[1]</f> shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?”
Genesis 3-2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,
Genesis 3-3 but God said, <f>ⓑ</f>‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”
Genesis 3-4 <f>ⓒ</f> But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die.
Genesis 3-5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
Genesis 3-6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, <f>[2]</f> she took of its fruit <f>ⓓ</f>and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, <f>ⓔ</f>and he ate.
Genesis 3-7 <f>ⓕ</f> Then the eyes of both were opened, <f>ⓖ</f>and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
Genesis 3-8 <pb/>And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool <f>[3]</f> of the day, and the man and his wife <f>ⓗ</f>hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
Genesis 3-9 But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” <f>[4]</f>
Genesis 3-10 And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, <f>ⓘ</f>because I was naked, and I hid myself.”
Genesis 3-11 He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”
Genesis 3-12 The man said, <f>ⓙ</f>“The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.”
Genesis 3-13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, <f>ⓚ</f>“The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
Genesis 3-14 <pb/>The LORD God said to the serpent, <pb/><t>“Because you have done this, </t><t>cursed are you above all livestock </t><t>and above all beasts of the field; </t><t>on your belly you shall go, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>dust you shall eat </t><t>all the days of your life.</t>
Genesis 3-15 <t>I will put enmity between you and the woman, </t><t>and between your offspring <f>[5]</f> and <f>ⓜ</f>her offspring; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>he shall bruise your head, </t><t>and you shall bruise his heel.” </t>
Genesis 3-16 <pb/>To the woman he said, <pb/><t>“I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>in pain you shall bring forth children. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>Your desire shall be contrary to <f>[6]</f> your husband, </t><t>but he shall <f>ⓠ</f>rule over you.” </t>
Genesis 3-17 <pb/>And to Adam he said, <pb/><t>“Because you have listened to the voice of your wife </t><t>and have eaten of the tree </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>of which I commanded you, </t><t>‘You shall not eat of it,’ </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>cursed is the ground because of you; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;</t>
Genesis 3-18 <t>thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; </t><t>and you shall eat the plants of the field.</t>
Genesis 3-19 <t>By the sweat of your face </t><t>you shall eat bread, </t><t>till you return to the ground, </t><t>for out of it you were taken; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>for you are dust, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>to dust you shall return.” </t>
Genesis 3-20 <pb/>The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. <f>[7]</f>
Genesis 3-21 And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.
Genesis 3-22 <pb/>Then the LORD God said, <f>ⓦ</f>“Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand <f>ⓧ</f>and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever — ”
Genesis 3-23 therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden <f>ⓨ</f>to work the ground from which he was taken.
Genesis 3-24 He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the <f>ⓩ</f>cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.
2 Chronicles 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom, <f>ⓑ</f>and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
2 Chronicles 1-2 <pb/>Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the <f>ⓒ</f>commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to all the leaders in all Israel, the heads of fathers' houses.
2 Chronicles 1-3 And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to <f>ⓓ</f>the high place that was at Gibeon, <f>ⓔ</f>for <f>ⓕ</f>the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there.
2 Chronicles 1-4 <f>ⓖ</f> (But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)
2 Chronicles 1-5 Moreover, <f>ⓗ</f>the bronze altar that <f>ⓘ</f>Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly <f>ⓙ</f>sought it <f>[1]</f> out.
2 Chronicles 1-6 And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, <f>ⓚ</f>and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
2 Chronicles 1-7 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.”
2 Chronicles 1-8 And Solomon said to God, “You have shown great and steadfast love to David my father, <f>ⓜ</f>and have made me king in his place.
2 Chronicles 1-9 O LORD God, <f>ⓝ</f>let your word to David my father be now fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people as numerous <f>ⓞ</f>as the dust of the earth.
2 Chronicles 1-10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge to <f>ⓟ</f>go out and come in before this people, for who can govern this people of yours, which is so great?”
2 Chronicles 1-11 God answered Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked for <f>ⓠ</f>possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked for long life, but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may govern my people over whom I have made you king,
2 Chronicles 1-12 wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you <f>ⓡ</f>riches, possessions, and honor, <f>ⓢ</f>such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like.”
2 Chronicles 1-13 So Solomon came from <f>[2]</f> the <f>ⓣ</f>high place at Gibeon, from before <f>ⓤ</f>the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.
2 Chronicles 1-14 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. <f>ⓦ</f>He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed <f>ⓧ</f>in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 1-15 And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.
2 Chronicles 1-16 And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders would buy them from Kue for a price.
2 Chronicles 1-17 They imported a chariot from Egypt for 600 shekels <f>[3]</f> of silver, and a horse for 150. Likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
