Leviticus 12-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 12-2 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If a woman conceives and bears a male child, then <f>ⓐ</f>she shall be unclean seven days. <f>ⓑ</f>As at the time of her menstruation, she shall be unclean.
Leviticus 12-3 And on the <f>ⓒ</f>eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus 12-4 Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying. She shall not touch anything holy, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.
Leviticus 12-5 But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation. And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying for sixty-six days.
Leviticus 12-6 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> “And when the days of her purifying are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a lamb a year old for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering,
Leviticus 12-7 and he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her. Then she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, either male or female.
Leviticus 12-8 And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take <f>ⓔ</f>two turtledoves or two pigeons, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. <f>ⓖ</f>And the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.”
Job 31-1 <pb/><t>“I have made a covenant with my <f>ⓐ</f>eyes; </t><t>how then could I gaze at a virgin?</t>
Job 31-2 <t>What would be <f>ⓑ</f>my portion from God above </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>my heritage from the Almighty on high?</t>
Job 31-3 <t>Is not calamity for the unrighteous, </t><t>and disaster for the workers of iniquity?</t>
Job 31-4 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Does not he see my ways </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>number all my steps? </t>
Job 31-5 <pb/><t>“If I have walked with falsehood </t><t>and my foot has hastened to deceit;</t>
Job 31-6 <t>(Let me be <f>ⓕ</f>weighed in a just balance, </t><t>and let God know my integrity!)</t>
Job 31-7 <t>if my step has turned aside from the way </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>my heart has gone after my eyes, </t><t>and if any <f>ⓗ</f>spot has stuck to my hands,</t>
Job 31-8 <t>then let me <f>ⓘ</f>sow, and another eat, </t><t>and let what grows for me <f>[1]</f> be rooted out. </t>
Job 31-9 <pb/><t>“If my heart has been enticed toward a woman, </t><t>and I have <f>ⓙ</f>lain in wait at my neighbor's door,</t>
Job 31-10 <t>then let my wife <f>ⓚ</f>grind for another, </t><t>and let others <f>ⓛ</f>bow down on her.</t>
Job 31-11 <t>For that would be a heinous crime; </t><t>that would be an iniquity <f>ⓜ</f>to be punished by the judges;</t>
Job 31-12 <t>for that would be a fire <f>ⓝ</f>that consumes as far as Abaddon, </t><t>and it would burn to the root all my increase. </t>
Job 31-13 <pb/><t>“If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant, </t><t>when they brought a complaint against me,</t>
Job 31-14 <t>what then shall I do when God rises up? </t><t>When he <f>ⓞ</f>makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?</t>
Job 31-15 <t>Did <f>ⓟ</f>not he who made me in the womb make him? </t><t>And did not one fashion us in the womb? </t>
Job 31-16 <pb/><t>“If I have <f>ⓠ</f>withheld anything that the poor desired, </t><t>or have <f>ⓡ</f>caused the eyes of the widow to fail,</t>
Job 31-17 <t>or have eaten my morsel alone, </t><t>and the fatherless has not eaten of it</t>
Job 31-18 <t>(for from my youth the fatherless <f>[2]</f> grew up with me as with a father, </t><t>and from my mother's womb I guided the widow <f>[3]</f>),</t>
Job 31-19 <t>if I have seen anyone <f>ⓢ</f>perish for <f>ⓣ</f>lack of clothing, </t><t>or the needy without <f>ⓤ</f>covering,</t>
Job 31-20 <t>if his body has not <f>ⓥ</f>blessed me, <f>[4]</f> </t><t>and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep,</t>
Job 31-21 <t>if I have raised my hand against <f>ⓦ</f>the fatherless, </t><t>because I saw my help in <f>ⓧ</f>the gate,</t>
Job 31-22 <t>then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, </t><t>and let my arm be broken from its socket.</t>
Job 31-23 <t>For I was <f>ⓨ</f>in terror of calamity from God, </t><t>and I could not have faced his <f>ⓩ</f>majesty. </t>
Job 31-24 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> “If I have made gold my <f>ⓑ</f>trust </t><t>or called <f>ⓒ</f>fine gold my confidence,</t>

Job 31-26 <t><f>ⓕ</f> if I have looked at the sun <f>[5]</f> when it shone, </t><t>or <f>ⓖ</f>the moon moving in splendor,</t>
Job 31-27 <t>and my heart has been secretly enticed, </t><t>and my mouth has kissed my hand,</t>
Job 31-28 <t>this also would be <f>ⓗ</f>an iniquity to be punished by the judges, </t><t>for I would have been false to God above. </t>
Job 31-29 <pb/><t>“If I have <f>ⓘ</f>rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me, </t><t>or exulted when evil overtook him</t>
Job 31-30 <t>(<f>ⓙ</f>I have not let my mouth sin </t><t>by asking for his life with a curse),</t>

Job 31-32 <t>(<f>ⓛ</f>the sojourner has not lodged in the street; </t><t>I have opened my doors to the traveler),</t>

Job 31-34 <t>because I stood in great fear of <f>ⓞ</f>the multitude, </t><t>and the contempt of families terrified me, </t><t>so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors — </t>
Job 31-35 <t>Oh, that I had one to hear me! </t><t>(Here is my signature! Let the Almighty <f>ⓟ</f>answer me!) </t><t>Oh, that I had <f>ⓠ</f>the indictment written by my adversary!</t>
Job 31-36 <t>Surely I would carry it on my <f>ⓡ</f>shoulder; </t><t>I would <f>ⓢ</f>bind it on me as <f>ⓣ</f>a crown;</t>
Job 31-37 <t>I would give him an account of all my steps; </t><t>like a prince I would approach him. </t>
Job 31-38 <pb/><t>“If my land has cried out against me </t><t>and its furrows have wept together,</t>

Job 31-40 <t>let <f>ⓦ</f>thorns grow instead of wheat, </t><t>and foul weeds instead of barley.” </t> <pb/>The words of Job are ended.
Ezekiel 30-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 30-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f>“Wail, ‘Alas for the day!’</t>
Ezekiel 30-3 <t><f>ⓒ</f> For the day is near, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>the day of the LORD is near; </t><t>it will be <f>ⓔ</f>a day of clouds, </t><t>a time of doom for <f>[1]</f> the nations.</t>
Ezekiel 30-4 <t><f>ⓕ</f> A sword shall come upon Egypt, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>and anguish shall be in <f>ⓗ</f>Cush, </t><t>when the slain fall in Egypt, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>her wealth <f>[2]</f> is carried away, </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>her foundations are torn down. </t>

Ezekiel 30-20 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 30-21 <f>ⓥ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓦ</f>I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and behold, <f>ⓧ</f>it has not been bound up, to heal it by binding it with a bandage, so that it may become strong to wield the sword.

Ezekiel 30-23 <f>ⓩ</f> I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel 30-24 And <f>ⓐ</f>I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put <f>ⓑ</f>my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him <f>ⓒ</f>like a man mortally wounded.
