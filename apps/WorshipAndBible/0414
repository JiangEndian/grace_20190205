49-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you <f>ⓑ</f>in days to come.

49-8 <pb/><t>“Judah, <f>ⓛ</f>your brothers shall praise you; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>your father's sons shall bow down before you.</t>

49-23 <t>The archers <f>ⓖ</f>bitterly attacked him, </t><t>shot at him, and harassed him severely,</t>

49-28 <pb/>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him.
49-29 Then he commanded them and said to them, “I am to be <f>ⓢ</f>gathered to my people; <f>ⓣ</f>bury me with my fathers <f>ⓤ</f>in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
49-30 in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, <f>ⓥ</f>which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place.
49-31 <f>ⓦ</f> There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There <f>ⓧ</f>they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah —
49-32 the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites.”
49-33 When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and <f>ⓨ</f>was gathered to his people.
1-1 <pb/>The words of <f>ⓐ</f>Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. <pb/>Now it happened in the month of <f>ⓑ</f>Chislev, <f>ⓒ</f>in the twentieth year, as I was in <f>ⓓ</f>Susa the citadel,
1-2 that <f>ⓔ</f>Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem.
1-3 And they said to me, “The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and <f>ⓕ</f>shame. <f>ⓖ</f>The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, <f>ⓗ</f>and its gates are destroyed by fire.”
1-4 <pb/>As soon as I heard these words I <f>ⓘ</f>sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the <f>ⓙ</f>God of heaven.
1-5 And I said, “O LORD God of heaven, <f>ⓚ</f>the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments,
1-6 <f>ⓛ</f> let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants, <f>ⓜ</f>confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Even <f>ⓝ</f>I and my father's house have sinned.
1-7 <f>ⓞ</f> We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules <f>ⓟ</f>that you commanded your servant Moses.
1-8 Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, <f>ⓠ</f>I will scatter you among the peoples,
1-9 <f>ⓡ</f> but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, <f>ⓢ</f>though your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there I will gather them and bring them <f>ⓣ</f>to the place that I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.’
1-10 <f>ⓤ</f> They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand.
1-11 O Lord, <f>ⓥ</f>let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, and give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” <pb/>Now I was <f>ⓦ</f>cupbearer to the king.
34-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when <f>ⓐ</f>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army <f>ⓑ</f>and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:
34-2 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to <f>ⓒ</f>Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓓ</f>Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
34-3 <f>ⓔ</f> You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. <f>ⓕ</f>You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.’
34-4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! <f>ⓖ</f>Thus says the LORD concerning you: <f>ⓗ</f>‘You shall not die by the sword.
34-5 You shall die in peace. <f>ⓘ</f>And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall <f>ⓙ</f>burn spices for you <f>ⓚ</f>and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!”’ For I have spoken the word, declares the LORD.”
34-6 <pb/>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
34-7 when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, <f>ⓛ</f>Lachish and <f>ⓜ</f>Azekah, <f>ⓝ</f>for these were the only <f>ⓞ</f>fortified cities of Judah that remained.
34-8 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah <f>ⓟ</f>had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem <f>ⓠ</f>to make a proclamation of liberty to them,
34-9 <f>ⓡ</f> that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, <f>ⓢ</f>so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother.
34-10 And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free.
34-11 But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves <f>ⓣ</f>they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.
34-12 The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
34-13 “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when <f>ⓤ</f>I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,
34-14 <f>ⓥ</f> ‘At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; <f>ⓦ</f>you must set him free from your service.’ But <f>ⓧ</f>your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me.
34-15 You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes <f>ⓨ</f>by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and <f>ⓩ</f>you made a covenant before me in the <f>ⓐ</f>house that is called by my name,
34-16 but then you turned around <f>ⓑ</f>and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, <f>ⓒ</f>whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.
34-17 <pb/>“Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me <f>ⓓ</f>by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; <f>ⓔ</f>behold, I proclaim to you liberty <f>ⓕ</f>to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the LORD. <f>ⓖ</f>I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
34-18 And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of <f>ⓗ</f>the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts —
34-19 the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, <f>ⓙ</f>the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf.
34-20 And I will give them into the hand of their enemies <f>ⓚ</f>and into the hand of those who seek their lives. <f>ⓛ</f>Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
34-21 And <f>ⓜ</f>Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon <f>ⓝ</f>which has withdrawn from you.
34-22 Behold, <f>ⓞ</f>I will command, declares the LORD, and will <f>ⓟ</f>bring them back to this city. <f>ⓠ</f>And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. <f>ⓡ</f>I will make the cities of Judah a desolation <f>ⓢ</f>without inhabitant.”
12-1 <pb/>Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and <f>ⓐ</f>sin which clings so closely, and <f>ⓑ</f>let us run <f>ⓒ</f>with endurance the race that is <f>ⓓ</f>set before us,
12-2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, <f>ⓔ</f>who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising <f>ⓕ</f>the shame, and <f>ⓖ</f>is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
12-3 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or <f>ⓘ</f>fainthearted.
12-4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
12-5 And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“My son, <f>ⓚ</f>do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, </t><t>nor be weary when reproved by him.</t>
12-6 <t>For <f>ⓛ</f>the Lord disciplines the one he loves, </t><t>and chastises every son whom he receives.” </t>
12-7 <pb/>It is for discipline that you have to endure. <f>ⓜ</f>God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
12-8 If you are left without discipline, <f>ⓝ</f>in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
12-9 Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to <f>ⓞ</f>the Father of spirits <f>ⓟ</f>and live?
12-10 For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, <f>ⓠ</f>that we may share his holiness.
12-11 <f>ⓡ</f> For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields <f>ⓢ</f>the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
12-12 <pb/>Therefore <f>ⓣ</f>lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,
12-13 and <f>ⓤ</f>make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint <f>ⓥ</f>but rather be healed.
12-14 <f>ⓦ</f> Strive for peace with everyone, and for the <f>ⓧ</f>holiness <f>ⓨ</f>without which no one will see the Lord.
12-15 See to it that no one <f>ⓩ</f>fails to obtain the grace of God; that no <f>ⓐ</f>“root of bitterness” springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;
12-16 that no one is <f>ⓑ</f>sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
12-17 For you know that <f>ⓒ</f>afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.
12-18 <pb/>For you have not come to <f>ⓓ</f>what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest
12-19 and <f>ⓔ</f>the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words <f>ⓕ</f>made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them.
12-20 For they could not endure the order that was given, <f>ⓖ</f>“If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.”
12-21 Indeed, <f>ⓗ</f>so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.”
12-22 But you have come to <f>ⓘ</f>Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, <f>ⓙ</f>the heavenly Jerusalem, and to <f>ⓚ</f>innumerable angels in festal gathering,
12-23 and to <f>ⓛ</f>the assembly <f>[1]</f> of the firstborn who are <f>ⓜ</f>enrolled in heaven, and to <f>ⓝ</f>God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
12-24 and to Jesus, <f>ⓞ</f>the mediator of a new covenant, and to <f>ⓟ</f>the sprinkled blood <f>ⓠ</f>that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
12-25 <pb/>See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For <f>ⓡ</f>if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven.
12-26 At that time <f>ⓢ</f>his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, <f>ⓣ</f>“Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”
12-27 This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates <f>ⓤ</f>the removal of things that are shaken — that is, things that have been made — in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain.
12-28 Therefore let us be grateful for receiving <f>ⓥ</f>a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus <f>ⓦ</f>let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe,
12-29 for our <f>ⓧ</f>God is a consuming fire.
