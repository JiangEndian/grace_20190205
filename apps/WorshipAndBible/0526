Job 20-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:

Job 20-13 <t>though he is loath to let it go </t><t>and holds it in his mouth,</t>
Job 20-14 <t>yet his food is turned in his stomach; </t><t>it is the venom of <f>ⓝ</f>cobras within him.</t>
Job 20-15 <t>He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; </t><t>God casts them out of his belly.</t>
Job 20-16 <t>He will suck the poison of cobras; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>the tongue of a viper will kill him.</t>

Ezekiel 19-1 <pb/>And you, <f>ⓐ</f>take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
Ezekiel 19-2 and say: <pb/><t>What was your mother? <f>ⓑ</f>A lioness! </t><t>Among lions she crouched; </t><t>in the midst of young lions </t><t>she reared her cubs.</t>
Ezekiel 19-3 <t>And she brought up one of her cubs; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>he became a young lion, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>and he learned to catch prey; </t><t>he devoured men.</t>
Ezekiel 19-4 <t>The nations heard about him; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>he was caught in their pit, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>and they brought him with hooks </t><t>to the land of Egypt.</t>
Ezekiel 19-5 <t>When she saw that she waited in vain, </t><t>that her hope was lost, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>she took another of her cubs </t><t>and made him a young lion.</t>
Ezekiel 19-6 <t>He prowled among the lions; </t><t>he became a young lion, </t><t>and he learned to catch prey; </t><t>he devoured men,</t>
Ezekiel 19-7 <t>and seized <f>[1]</f> their widows. </t><t>He laid waste their cities, </t><t>and the land was appalled and all who were in it </t><t>at the sound of his roaring.</t>
Ezekiel 19-8 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Then the nations set against him </t><t>from provinces on every side; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>they spread their net over him; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>he was taken in their pit.</t>
Ezekiel 19-9 <t>With hooks <f>ⓚ</f>they put him in a cage <f>[2]</f> </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>brought him to the king of Babylon; </t><t>they brought him into custody, </t><t>that his voice should no more be heard </t><t>on <f>ⓜ</f>the mountains of Israel. </t>
Ezekiel 19-10 <pb/><t>Your mother was <f>ⓝ</f>like a vine in a vineyard <f>[3]</f> </t><t>planted by the water, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>fruitful and full of branches </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>by reason of abundant water.</t>
Ezekiel 19-11 <t>Its strong stems became </t><t>rulers' scepters; </t><t>it towered aloft </t><t>among the thick boughs; <f>[4]</f> </t><t>it was seen in its height </t><t>with the mass of its branches.</t>
Ezekiel 19-12 <t>But the vine was plucked up in fury, </t><t>cast down to the ground; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>the east wind dried up its fruit; </t><t>they were stripped off and withered. </t><t>As for its strong stem, </t><t>fire consumed it.</t>
Ezekiel 19-13 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Now it is planted in the wilderness, </t><t>in a dry and thirsty land.</t>
Ezekiel 19-14 <t><f>ⓢ</f> And fire has gone out from the stem of its shoots, </t><t>has consumed its fruit, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>so that there remains in it no strong stem, </t><t>no scepter for ruling. </t> <pb/>This is <f>ⓤ</f>a lamentation and has become a lamentation.

Revelation 20-2 And he seized <f>ⓒ</f>the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and <f>ⓓ</f>bound him for a thousand years,
Revelation 20-3 and threw him into <f>ⓔ</f>the pit, and shut it and <f>ⓕ</f>sealed it over him, so that <f>ⓖ</f>he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.
Revelation 20-4 <pb/>Then I saw <f>ⓗ</f>thrones, and <f>ⓘ</f>seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw <f>ⓙ</f>the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those <f>ⓚ</f>who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. <f>ⓛ</f>They came to life and <f>ⓜ</f>reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
Revelation 20-5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation 20-6 <f>ⓝ</f> Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such <f>ⓞ</f>the second death has no power, but they will be <f>ⓟ</f>priests of God and of Christ, and they <f>ⓠ</f>will reign with him for a thousand years.
Revelation 20-7 <pb/>And when the thousand years are ended, <f>ⓡ</f>Satan will be released from his prison
Revelation 20-8 and will come out <f>ⓢ</f>to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, <f>ⓣ</f>Gog and Magog, <f>ⓤ</f>to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.
Revelation 20-9 And <f>ⓥ</f>they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded <f>ⓦ</f>the camp of the saints and <f>ⓧ</f>the beloved city, but <f>ⓨ</f>fire came down from heaven <f>[2]</f> and consumed them,
Revelation 20-10 and the devil <f>ⓩ</f>who had deceived them was <f>ⓐ</f>thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where <f>ⓑ</f>the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
Revelation 20-11 <pb/>Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence <f>ⓒ</f>earth and sky fled away, and <f>ⓓ</f>no place was found for them.
Revelation 20-12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and <f>ⓔ</f>books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is <f>ⓕ</f>the book of life. And <f>ⓖ</f>the dead were judged by what was written in the books, <f>ⓗ</f>according to what they had done.
Revelation 20-13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, <f>ⓘ</f>Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, <f>ⓙ</f>according to what they had done.
Revelation 20-14 Then <f>ⓚ</f>Death and Hades <f>ⓛ</f>were thrown into the lake of fire. This is <f>ⓜ</f>the second death, the lake of fire.
Revelation 20-15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, <f>ⓝ</f>he was thrown into the lake of fire.
