Judges 1-1 <pb/>After the death of Joshua, the people of Israel <f>ⓐ</f>inquired of the LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>“Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”
Judges 1-2 The LORD said, “Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand.”
Judges 1-3 And Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites. <f>ⓒ</f>And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you.” So Simeon went with him.
Judges 1-4 Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek.
Judges 1-5 They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
Judges 1-6 Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.
Judges 1-7 And Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off <f>ⓓ</f>used to pick up scraps under my table. <f>ⓔ</f>As I have done, so God has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
Judges 1-8 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
Judges 1-9 And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in <f>ⓖ</f>the hill country, in the Negeb, and in <f>ⓗ</f>the lowland.
Judges 1-10 <f>ⓘ</f> And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron <f>ⓙ</f>(now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they defeated <f>ⓚ</f>Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
Judges 1-11 <pb/>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher.
Judges 1-12 And Caleb said, “He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife.”
Judges 1-13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, <f>ⓛ</f>Caleb's younger brother, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
Judges 1-14 When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”
Judges 1-15 She said to him, “Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water.” And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
Judges 1-16 <pb/>And the descendants of the <f>ⓜ</f>Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah <f>ⓝ</f>from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near <f>ⓞ</f>Arad, <f>ⓟ</f>and they went and settled with the people.
Judges 1-17 <f>ⓠ</f> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So the name of the city was called <f>ⓡ</f>Hormah. <f>[1]</f>
Judges 1-18 Judah also <f>ⓢ</f>captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.
Judges 1-19 <f>ⓣ</f> And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the <f>ⓤ</f>hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had <f>ⓥ</f>chariots of iron.
Judges 1-20 <f>ⓦ</f> And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he drove out from it <f>ⓧ</f>the three sons of Anak.
Judges 1-21 But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, <f>ⓨ</f>so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
Judges 1-22 <pb/>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, <f>ⓩ</f>and the LORD was with them.
Judges 1-23 And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel. (<f>ⓐ</f>Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)
Judges 1-24 And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the way into the city, <f>ⓑ</f>and we will deal kindly with you.”
Judges 1-25 And he showed them the way into the city. And they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.
Judges 1-26 And the man went to <f>ⓒ</f>the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz. That is its name to this day.
Judges 1-27 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
Judges 1-28 When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely.
Judges 1-29 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
Judges 1-30 <pb/>Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of <f>ⓕ</f>Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but became subject to forced labor.
Judges 1-31 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob,

Judges 1-33 <pb/>Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of <f>ⓗ</f>Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, so they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.
Judges 1-34 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain.
Judges 1-35 The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, <f>ⓙ</f>in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor.
Judges 1-36 And the border of the Amorites ran from <f>ⓚ</f>the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
Psalm 99-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> The LORD reigns; <f>ⓑ</f>let the peoples tremble! </t><t>He <f>ⓒ</f>sits enthroned upon the cherubim; <f>ⓓ</f>let the earth quake!</t>

Matthew 13-1 <pb/>That same day Jesus went out of the house <f>ⓐ</f>and sat beside the sea.
Matthew 13-2 And great crowds gathered about him, <f>ⓑ</f>so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach.
Matthew 13-3 And <f>ⓒ</f>he told them many things in parables, saying: <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“A sower went out to sow.</J>
Matthew 13-4 <J>And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.</J>
Matthew 13-5 <J>Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,</J>
Matthew 13-6 <J>but <f>ⓔ</f>when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, <f>ⓕ</f>they withered away.</J>
Matthew 13-7 <J>Other seeds fell among <f>ⓖ</f>thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</J>
Matthew 13-8 <J>Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some <f>ⓗ</f>a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</J>
Matthew 13-9 <J><f>ⓘ</f> He who has ears, <f>[1]</f> let him hear.”</J>
Matthew 13-10 <pb/>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
Matthew 13-11 And he answered them, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“To you it has been given to know <f>ⓚ</f>the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</J>
Matthew 13-12 <J><f>ⓛ</f> For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, <f>ⓜ</f>even what he has will be taken away.</J>
Matthew 13-13 <J>This is why I speak to them in parables, because <f>ⓝ</f>seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, <f>ⓞ</f>nor do they understand.</J>
Matthew 13-14 <J>Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓟ</f>“‘“You will indeed hear but never understand,</J> </t><t><J>and you will indeed see but never perceive.”</J></t>
Matthew 13-15 <t><J>For this people's heart has grown dull,</J> </t><t><J>and with their ears <f>ⓠ</f>they can barely hear,</J> </t><t><J>and <f>ⓡ</f>their eyes they have closed,</J> </t><t><J>lest they should see with their eyes</J> </t><t><J>and hear with their ears</J> </t><t><J>and <f>ⓢ</f>understand with their heart</J> </t><t><J>and <f>ⓣ</f>turn, and I would heal them.’</J> </t>
Matthew 13-16 <pb/><J>But <f>ⓤ</f>blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.</J>
Matthew 13-17 <J><f>ⓥ</f> For truly, I say to you, <f>ⓦ</f>many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</J>
Matthew 13-18 <pb/><J><f>ⓧ</f> “Hear then the parable of the sower:</J>
Matthew 13-19 <J>When anyone hears the word of <f>ⓨ</f>the kingdom and <f>ⓩ</f>does not understand it, <f>ⓐ</f>the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.</J>
Matthew 13-20 <J>As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately <f>ⓑ</f>receives it with joy,</J>
Matthew 13-21 <J>yet he has no root in himself, but <f>ⓒ</f>endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately <f>ⓓ</f>he falls away. <f>[2]</f></J>
Matthew 13-22 <J>As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but <f>ⓔ</f>the cares of <f>ⓕ</f>the world and <f>ⓖ</f>the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</J>
Matthew 13-23 <J>As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and <f>ⓗ</f>understands it. He indeed <f>ⓘ</f>bears fruit and yields, in one case <f>ⓙ</f>a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”</J>
Matthew 13-24 <pb/>He put another parable before them, saying, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field,</J>
Matthew 13-25 <J>but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds <f>[3]</f> among the wheat and went away.</J>
Matthew 13-26 <J>So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.</J>
Matthew 13-27 <J>And the servants <f>[4]</f> of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’</J>
Matthew 13-28 <J>He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’</J>
Matthew 13-29 <J>But he said, <f>ⓛ</f>‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them.</J>
Matthew 13-30 <J>Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, <f>ⓜ</f>“Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</J>
Matthew 13-31 <pb/>He put another parable before them, saying, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“The kingdom of heaven is like <f>ⓞ</f>a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.</J>
Matthew 13-32 <J>It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”</J>
Matthew 13-33 <pb/>He told them another parable. <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in <f>ⓠ</f>three measures of flour, till it was <f>ⓡ</f>all leavened.”</J>
Matthew 13-34 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable.
Matthew 13-35 This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: <f>[5]</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“I will open my mouth in parables; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>I will utter what has been hidden <f>ⓥ</f>since the foundation of the world.” </t>
Matthew 13-36 <pb/>Then he left the crowds and went into <f>ⓦ</f>the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, <f>ⓧ</f>“Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.”
Matthew 13-37 He answered, <J>“The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</J>
Matthew 13-38 <J>The field is the world, and the good seed is <f>ⓨ</f>the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are <f>ⓩ</f>the sons of the evil one,</J>
Matthew 13-39 <J>and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. <f>ⓐ</f>The harvest is <f>ⓑ</f>the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.</J>
Matthew 13-40 <J>Just as the weeds <f>ⓒ</f>are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at <f>ⓓ</f>the end of the age.</J>
Matthew 13-41 <J><f>ⓔ</f> The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all <f>ⓕ</f>causes of sin and <f>ⓖ</f>all law-breakers,</J>
Matthew 13-42 <J><f>ⓗ</f> and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place <f>ⓘ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</J>
Matthew 13-43 <J>Then <f>ⓙ</f>the righteous will shine like the sun <f>ⓚ</f>in the kingdom of their Father. <f>ⓛ</f>He who has ears, let him hear.</J>
Matthew 13-44 <pb/><J>“The kingdom of heaven <f>ⓜ</f>is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy <f>ⓝ</f>he goes and sells all that he has and <f>ⓞ</f>buys that field.</J>
Matthew 13-45 <pb/><J>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,</J>
Matthew 13-46 <J>who, on finding <f>ⓟ</f>one pearl of great value, <f>ⓠ</f>went and sold all that he had and <f>ⓡ</f>bought it.</J>
Matthew 13-47 <pb/><J>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is <f>ⓢ</f>like a net that was thrown into the sea and <f>ⓣ</f>gathered fish of every kind.</J>
Matthew 13-48 <J>When it was full, <f>ⓤ</f>men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad.</J>
Matthew 13-49 <J>So it will be at <f>ⓥ</f>the end of the age. The angels will come out and <f>ⓦ</f>separate the evil from the righteous</J>
Matthew 13-50 <J><f>ⓧ</f> and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place <f>ⓨ</f>there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</J>
Matthew 13-51 <pb/><J><f>ⓩ</f> “Have you understood all these things?”</J> They said to him, “Yes.”
Matthew 13-52 And he said to them, <J>“Therefore every <f>ⓐ</f>scribe <f>ⓑ</f>who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who <f>ⓒ</f>brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”</J>
Matthew 13-53 <pb/>And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there,
Matthew 13-54 <f>ⓓ</f> and coming to <f>ⓔ</f>his hometown <f>ⓕ</f>he taught them in their synagogue, so that <f>ⓖ</f>they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?
Matthew 13-55 <f>ⓗ</f> Is not this <f>ⓘ</f>the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not <f>ⓙ</f>his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Matthew 13-56 And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?”
Matthew 13-57 And <f>ⓚ</f>they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.”</J>
Matthew 13-58 And he did not do many mighty works there, <f>ⓜ</f>because of their unbelief.
