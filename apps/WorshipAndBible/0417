Exodus 2-1 <pb/>Now a <f>ⓐ</f>man from the house of Levi went and took as his wife a Levite woman.
Exodus 2-2 The woman conceived and bore a son, and <f>ⓑ</f>when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.
Exodus 2-3 When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes <f>[1]</f> and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the <f>ⓒ</f>reeds by the river bank.
Exodus 2-4 And <f>ⓓ</f>his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.
Exodus 2-5 Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.
Exodus 2-6 When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews' children.”
Exodus 2-7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, “Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?”
Exodus 2-8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, “Go.” So the girl went and called the child's mother.
Exodus 2-9 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.
Exodus 2-10 When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became <f>ⓔ</f>her son. She named him Moses, “Because,” she said, “I <f>ⓕ</f>drew him out of the water.” <f>[2]</f>
Exodus 2-11 <pb/>One day, <f>ⓖ</f>when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their <f>ⓗ</f>burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people. <f>[3]</f>
Exodus 2-12 He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he <f>ⓘ</f>struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
Exodus 2-13 When <f>ⓙ</f>he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, “Why do you strike your companion?”
Exodus 2-14 He answered, <f>ⓚ</f>“Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid, and thought, “Surely the thing is known.”
Exodus 2-15 When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But <f>ⓛ</f>Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by <f>ⓜ</f>a well.
Exodus 2-16 <pb/>Now the <f>ⓝ</f>priest of Midian had seven daughters, and <f>ⓞ</f>they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
Exodus 2-17 The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and <f>ⓟ</f>watered their flock.
Exodus 2-18 When they came home to their father <f>ⓠ</f>Reuel, he said, “How is it that you have come home so soon today?”
Exodus 2-19 They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and <f>ⓡ</f>watered the flock.”
Exodus 2-20 He said to his daughters, “Then where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may <f>ⓢ</f>eat bread.”
Exodus 2-21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter <f>ⓣ</f>Zipporah.
Exodus 2-22 She gave birth to a son, and he called his name <f>ⓤ</f>Gershom, for he said, “I have been a <f>ⓥ</f>sojourner <f>[4]</f> in a foreign land.”
Exodus 2-23 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel <f>ⓧ</f>groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. <f>ⓨ</f>Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.
Exodus 2-24 And <f>ⓩ</f>God heard their groaning, and God <f>ⓐ</f>remembered his covenant with <f>ⓑ</f>Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
Exodus 2-25 God <f>ⓒ</f>saw the people of Israel — and God <f>ⓓ</f>knew.
Nehemiah 4-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> Now when <f>ⓐ</f>Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he jeered at the Jews.
Nehemiah 4-2 And he said in the presence of his brothers and of the army of <f>ⓑ</f>Samaria, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves? <f>[2]</f> Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, and burned ones at that?”
Nehemiah 4-3 <f>ⓒ</f> Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Yes, what they are building — <f>ⓓ</f>if a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall!”
Nehemiah 4-4 <f>ⓔ</f> Hear, O our God, for we are despised. <f>ⓕ</f>Turn back their taunt on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives.
Nehemiah 4-5 <f>ⓖ</f> Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from your sight, for they have provoked you to anger in the presence of the builders.
Nehemiah 4-6 <pb/>So we built the wall. And all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.
Nehemiah 4-7 <pb/><f>[3]</f> But when <f>ⓗ</f>Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the breaches were beginning to be closed, they were very angry.
Nehemiah 4-8 <f>ⓘ</f> And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.
Nehemiah 4-9 And we prayed to our God and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.
Nehemiah 4-10 <pb/>In Judah it was said, <f>[4]</f> “The strength of those who bear the burdens is failing. There is too much rubble. By ourselves we will not be able to rebuild the wall.”
Nehemiah 4-11 And our enemies said, “They will not know or see till we come among them and kill them and stop the work.”
Nehemiah 4-12 At that time the Jews who lived near them came from all directions and said to us ten times, “You must return to us.” <f>[5]</f>
Nehemiah 4-13 So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people by their clans, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
Nehemiah 4-14 And I looked and arose and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, <f>ⓙ</f>“Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, <f>ⓚ</f>who is great and awesome, <f>ⓛ</f>and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.”
Nehemiah 4-15 <pb/>When our enemies heard that it was known to us <f>ⓜ</f>and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each to his work.
Nehemiah 4-16 From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and <f>ⓝ</f>coats of mail. And the leaders stood behind the whole house of Judah,
Nehemiah 4-17 who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other.
Nehemiah 4-18 And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.
Nehemiah 4-19 And I said to <f>ⓞ</f>the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another.
Nehemiah 4-20 In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. <f>ⓟ</f>Our God will fight for us.”
Nehemiah 4-21 <pb/>So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.
Nehemiah 4-22 I also said to the people at that time, “Let every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day.”
Nehemiah 4-23 So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; <f>ⓠ</f>each kept his weapon at his right hand. <f>[6]</f>
Jeremiah 37-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Zedekiah the son of Josiah, <f>ⓑ</f>whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of <f>ⓒ</f>Coniah the son of Jehoiakim.
Jeremiah 37-2 <f>ⓓ</f> But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah 37-3 <pb/>King Zedekiah sent <f>ⓔ</f>Jehucal the son of <f>ⓕ</f>Shelemiah, and <f>ⓖ</f>Zephaniah the priest, the son of <f>ⓗ</f>Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please <f>ⓘ</f>pray for us to the LORD our God.”
Jeremiah 37-4 <f>ⓙ</f> Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, <f>ⓚ</f>for he had not yet been put in prison.
Jeremiah 37-5 <f>ⓛ</f> The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt. And when <f>ⓜ</f>the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news about them, <f>ⓝ</f>they withdrew from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 37-6 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
Jeremiah 37-7 “Thus says the LORD, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who <f>ⓞ</f>sent you to me to inquire of me, ‘Behold, <f>ⓟ</f>Pharaoh's army that came to help you is about to <f>ⓠ</f>return to Egypt, to its own land.
Jeremiah 37-8 And <f>ⓡ</f>the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city. <f>ⓢ</f>They shall capture it and burn it with fire.
Jeremiah 37-9 Thus says the LORD, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,” for they will not go away.
Jeremiah 37-10 <f>ⓣ</f> For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and <f>ⓤ</f>burn this city with fire.’”
Jeremiah 37-11 <pb/>Now when <f>ⓥ</f>the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,
Jeremiah 37-12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to <f>ⓦ</f>the land of Benjamin <f>ⓧ</f>to receive his portion there <f>ⓨ</f>among the people.
Jeremiah 37-13 When he was at <f>ⓩ</f>the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of <f>ⓐ</f>Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, <f>ⓑ</f>“You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”
Jeremiah 37-14 And Jeremiah said, “It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to <f>ⓒ</f>the officials.
Jeremiah 37-15 And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him <f>ⓓ</f>and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.
Jeremiah 37-16 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days,
Jeremiah 37-17 King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him <f>ⓕ</f>secretly in his house and said, “Is there any word from the LORD?” Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, <f>ⓖ</f>“You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
Jeremiah 37-18 Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, <f>ⓗ</f>that you have put me in prison?
Jeremiah 37-19 <f>ⓘ</f> Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’?
Jeremiah 37-20 Now hear, please, O my lord the king: <f>ⓙ</f>let my humble plea come before you and <f>ⓚ</f>do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there.”
Jeremiah 37-21 So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to <f>ⓛ</f>the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, <f>ⓜ</f>until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in <f>ⓝ</f>the court of the guard.
James 2-1 <pb/>My brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, <f>ⓑ</f>the Lord of glory.
James 2-2 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,
James 2-3 and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” <f>ⓒ</f>while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”
James 2-4 have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become <f>ⓓ</f>judges with evil thoughts?
James 2-5 Listen, my beloved brothers, <f>ⓔ</f>has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be <f>ⓕ</f>rich in faith and heirs of <f>ⓖ</f>the kingdom, <f>ⓗ</f>which he has promised to those who love him?
James 2-6 But you <f>ⓘ</f>have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who <f>ⓙ</f>drag you <f>ⓚ</f>into court?
James 2-7 Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable <f>ⓛ</f>name by which you were called?
James 2-8 <pb/>If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, <f>ⓜ</f>“You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.
James 2-9 But if you <f>ⓝ</f>show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
James 2-10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point <f>ⓞ</f>has become guilty of all of it.
James 2-11 For he who said, <f>ⓟ</f>“Do not commit adultery,” also said, <f>ⓠ</f>“Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
James 2-12 So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under <f>ⓡ</f>the law of liberty.
James 2-13 For <f>ⓢ</f>judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
James 2-14 <pb/>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith <f>ⓣ</f>but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
James 2-15 <f>ⓤ</f> If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,
James 2-16 <f>ⓥ</f> and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good <f>[2]</f> is that?
James 2-17 So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
James 2-18 <pb/>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith <f>ⓦ</f>apart from your works, and I will show you my faith <f>ⓧ</f>by my works.
James 2-19 <f>ⓨ</f> You believe that God is one; you do well. Even <f>ⓩ</f>the demons believe — and shudder!
James 2-20 Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?
James 2-21 <f>ⓐ</f> Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?
James 2-22 You see that <f>ⓑ</f>faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed <f>ⓒ</f>by his works;
James 2-23 and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, <f>ⓓ</f>“Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness” — and he was called a <f>ⓔ</f>friend of God.
James 2-24 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
James 2-25 And in the same way was not also <f>ⓕ</f>Rahab the prostitute justified by works <f>ⓖ</f>when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
James 2-26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.
