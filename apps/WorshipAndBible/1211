2 Samuel 23-1 <pb/>Now these are the last words of David: <pb/><t>The oracle of David, the son of Jesse, </t><t>the oracle of <f>ⓐ</f>the man who was raised on high, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>the anointed of the God of Jacob, </t><t>the sweet psalmist of Israel: <f>[1]</f> </t>
2 Samuel 23-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> “The Spirit of the LORD speaks by me; </t><t>his word is on my tongue.</t>
2 Samuel 23-3 <t>The God of Israel has spoken; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>the Rock of Israel has said to me: </t><t>When one rules justly over men, </t><t>ruling <f>ⓔ</f>in the fear of God,</t>
2 Samuel 23-4 <t>he <f>ⓕ</f>dawns on them like the morning light, </t><t>like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning, </t><t>like rain <f>[2]</f> that makes grass to sprout from the earth. </t>
2 Samuel 23-5 <pb/><t>“For does not my house stand so with God? </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>For he has made with me an everlasting covenant, </t><t>ordered in all things and secure. </t><t>For will he not cause to prosper </t><t>all my help and my desire?</t>
2 Samuel 23-6 <t>But worthless men <f>[3]</f> are all like thorns that are thrown away, </t><t>for they cannot be taken with the hand;</t>
2 Samuel 23-7 <t>but the man who touches them </t><t>arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear, </t><t>and they are utterly consumed with fire.” <f>[4]</f> </t>
2 Samuel 23-8 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: <f>ⓘ</f>Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was chief of the three. <f>[5]</f> He wielded his spear <f>[6]</f> against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.
2 Samuel 23-9 <pb/>And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of <f>ⓙ</f>Dodo, son of <f>ⓚ</f>Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew.
2 Samuel 23-10 He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And the LORD brought about a great victory that day, and the men returned after him only to strip the slain.
2 Samuel 23-11 <pb/>And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the <f>ⓛ</f>Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, <f>[7]</f> where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the men fled from the Philistines.
2 Samuel 23-12 But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines, and the LORD worked a great victory.
2 Samuel 23-13 <pb/>And three of the thirty chief men went down and came about harvest time to David at the <f>ⓜ</f>cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped <f>ⓝ</f>in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel 23-14 David was then <f>ⓞ</f>in the stronghold, and <f>ⓟ</f>the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
2 Samuel 23-15 And David said longingly, “Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!”
2 Samuel 23-16 Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it. He poured it out to the LORD
2 Samuel 23-17 and said, “Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink <f>ⓠ</f>the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
2 Samuel 23-18 <pb/>Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. <f>[8]</f> And he wielded his spear against three hundred men <f>[9]</f> and killed them and won a name beside the three.
2 Samuel 23-19 He was the most renowned of the thirty <f>[10]</f> and became their commander, but he did not attain to <f>ⓡ</f>the three.
2 Samuel 23-20 <pb/>And <f>ⓢ</f>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man <f>[11]</f> of <f>ⓣ</f>Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two ariels <f>[12]</f> of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
2 Samuel 23-21 And he struck down an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
2 Samuel 23-22 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men.
2 Samuel 23-23 He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.

Acts 2-16 But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:
Acts 2-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> “‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>that I will pour out my Spirit <f>ⓢ</f>on all flesh, </t><t>and your sons and <f>ⓣ</f>your daughters shall prophesy, </t><t>and your young men shall see visions, </t><t>and your old men shall dream dreams;</t>

Acts 2-23 this Jesus, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>delivered up according to <f>ⓓ</f>the definite plan and <f>ⓔ</f>foreknowledge of God, <f>ⓕ</f>you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.

Acts 2-30 <f>ⓢ</f> Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that <f>ⓣ</f>God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,
Acts 2-31 he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that <f>ⓤ</f>he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
Acts 2-32 This Jesus <f>ⓥ</f>God raised up, <f>ⓦ</f>and of that we all are witnesses.
Acts 2-33 <f>ⓧ</f> Being therefore <f>ⓨ</f>exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from <f>ⓩ</f>the Father <f>ⓐ</f>the promise of the Holy Spirit, <f>ⓑ</f>he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.
Acts 2-34 For <f>ⓒ</f>David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“‘The Lord said to my Lord, </t><t>“Sit at my right hand,</t>
Acts 2-35 <t>until I make your enemies your footstool.”’ </t>
Acts 2-36 <pb/>Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that <f>ⓔ</f>God has made him <f>ⓕ</f>both Lord and Christ, this Jesus <f>ⓖ</f>whom you crucified.”
Acts 2-37 <pb/>Now when <f>ⓗ</f>they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, <f>ⓘ</f>what shall we do?”
Acts 2-38 And Peter said to them, <f>ⓙ</f>“Repent and <f>ⓚ</f>be baptized every one of you <f>ⓛ</f>in the name of Jesus Christ <f>ⓜ</f>for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive <f>ⓝ</f>the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Acts 2-40 And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, <f>ⓢ</f>“Save yourselves from this <f>ⓣ</f>crooked generation.”
Acts 2-41 So those who received his word were baptized, and <f>ⓤ</f>there were added that day about three thousand souls.
Acts 2-42 <pb/>And <f>ⓥ</f>they devoted themselves to the apostles' <f>ⓦ</f>teaching and the <f>ⓧ</f>fellowship, to <f>ⓨ</f>the breaking of bread and the prayers.
Acts 2-43 And awe <f>[4]</f> came upon every soul, and <f>ⓩ</f>many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.
Acts 2-44 And all who believed were together and <f>ⓐ</f>had all things in common.
Acts 2-45 And <f>ⓑ</f>they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.
Acts 2-46 And day by day, <f>ⓒ</f>attending the temple <f>ⓓ</f>together and <f>ⓔ</f>breaking bread in their homes, they received their food <f>ⓕ</f>with glad and generous hearts,
Acts 2-47 praising God and <f>ⓖ</f>having favor with all the people. And the Lord <f>ⓗ</f>added to their number <f>ⓘ</f>day by day those who <f>ⓙ</f>were being saved.
