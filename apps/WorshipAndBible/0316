20-1 <pb/>From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between <f>ⓐ</f>Kadesh and Shur; and he <f>ⓑ</f>sojourned in <f>ⓒ</f>Gerar.
20-2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, <f>ⓓ</f>“She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
20-3 <f>ⓔ</f> But God came to Abimelech <f>ⓕ</f>in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife.”
20-4 Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Lord, will you kill an innocent people?
20-5 Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.”
20-6 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning <f>ⓗ</f>against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.
20-7 Now then, return the man's wife, <f>ⓘ</f>for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you <f>ⓙ</f>and all who are yours.”
20-8 <pb/>So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.
20-9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.”
20-10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?”
20-11 Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, <f>ⓚ</f>‘There is no fear of God at all in this place, and <f>ⓛ</f>they will kill me because of my wife.’
20-12 Besides, <f>ⓜ</f>she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.
20-13 And when <f>ⓝ</f>God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, <f>ⓞ</f>say of me, “He is my brother.”’”
20-14 <pb/>Then Abimelech <f>ⓟ</f>took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him.
20-15 And Abimelech said, “Behold, <f>ⓠ</f>my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.”
20-16 To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given <f>ⓡ</f>your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is <f>ⓢ</f>a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all <f>[1]</f> who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.”
20-17 Then <f>ⓣ</f>Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.
20-18 For the LORD <f>ⓤ</f>had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
18-1 <pb/>Now Jehoshaphat <f>ⓐ</f>had great riches and honor, <f>ⓑ</f>and he made a marriage alliance with Ahab.
18-2 <f>ⓒ</f> After some years he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab killed an abundance of sheep and oxen for him and for the people who were with him, and induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.
18-3 Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?” He answered him, “I am as you are, my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.”
18-4 <pb/>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
18-5 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for God will give it into the hand of the king.”
18-6 But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?”
18-7 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil.” And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say so.”
18-8 Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.”
18-9 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes. And they were sitting at the threshing floor <f>ⓓ</f>at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
18-10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.’”
18-11 And all the prophets prophesied so and said, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph. The LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”
18-12 <pb/>And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.”
18-13 But Micaiah said, <f>ⓔ</f>“As the LORD lives, <f>ⓕ</f>what my God says, that I will speak.”
18-14 And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” And he answered, “Go up and triumph; they will be given into your hand.”
18-15 But the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
18-16 And he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, <f>ⓖ</f>as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.’”
18-17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
18-18 And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: <f>ⓗ</f>I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
18-19 And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab the king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said one thing, and another said another.
18-20 Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, ‘I will entice him.’ And the LORD said to him, ‘By what means?’
18-21 And he said, ‘I will go out, and will be <f>ⓘ</f>a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.’
18-22 Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets. The LORD has declared disaster concerning you.”
18-23 <pb/>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near <f>ⓙ</f>and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?”
18-24 And Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.”
18-25 And the king of Israel said, “Seize Micaiah and take him back to Amon <f>ⓚ</f>the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son,
18-26 and say, ‘Thus says the king, <f>ⓛ</f>Put this fellow in prison and feed him with meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace.’”
18-27 And Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, <f>ⓜ</f>“Hear, all you peoples!”
18-28 <pb/>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
18-29 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.” And the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
18-30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, “Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.”
18-31 As soon as the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; God drew them away from him.
18-32 For as soon as the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
18-33 But a certain man drew his bow at random <f>[1]</f> and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”
18-34 And the battle continued that day, and the king of Israel was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening. Then at sunset he died.
5-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, </t><t>look and take note! </t><t>Search her squares to see </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>if you can find a man, </t><t>one who does justice </t><t>and seeks truth, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>that I may pardon her.</t>
5-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Though they say, “As the LORD lives,” </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>yet they swear falsely.</t>
5-3 <t>O LORD, do not your eyes look for truth? </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>You have struck them down, </t><t>but they felt no anguish; </t><t>you have consumed them, </t><t>but they refused to take correction. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>They have made their faces harder than rock; </t><t>they have refused to repent. </t>
5-4 <pb/><t>Then I said, “These are only the poor; </t><t>they have no sense; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>for they do not know the way of the LORD, </t><t>the justice of their God.</t>
5-5 <t>I will go to the great </t><t>and will speak to them, </t><t>for they know the way of the LORD, </t><t>the justice of their God.” </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>But they all alike had broken the yoke; </t><t>they had burst the bonds. </t>
5-6 <pb/><t>Therefore <f>ⓙ</f>a lion from the forest shall strike them down; </t><t>a <f>ⓚ</f>wolf from the desert shall devastate them. </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>A leopard is watching their cities; </t><t>everyone who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces, </t><t>because their transgressions are many, </t><t>their <f>ⓜ</f>apostasies are great. </t>
5-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> “How can I pardon you? </t><t>Your children have forsaken me </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and have sworn by those who are no gods. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>When I fed them to the full, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>they committed adultery </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>and trooped to the houses of whores.</t>
5-8 <t>They were well-fed, lusty stallions, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>each neighing <f>ⓣ</f>for his neighbor's wife.</t>
5-9 <t><f>ⓤ</f> Shall I not punish them for these things? <pb/>declares the LORD; </t><t>and shall I not avenge myself </t><t>on a nation such as this? </t>
5-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f> “Go up through her vine rows and destroy, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>but make not a full end; </t><t>strip away her branches, </t><t>for they are not the LORD's.</t>
5-11 <t><f>ⓧ</f> For the house of Israel and the house of Judah </t><t>have been utterly treacherous to me, <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
5-12 <t>They have spoken falsely of the LORD </t><t>and have said, ‘He will do nothing; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>no disaster will come upon us, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>nor shall we see sword or famine.</t>
5-13 <t>The prophets will become wind; </t><t>the word is not in them. </t><t>Thus shall it be done to them!’” </t>
5-14 <pb/><t>Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of hosts: </t><t>“Because you have spoken this word, </t><t>behold, <f>ⓐ</f>I am making my words in your mouth <f>ⓑ</f>a fire, </t><t>and this people wood, and the fire shall consume them.</t>
5-15 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Behold, I am bringing against you </t><t>a nation from afar, O house of Israel, <pb/>declares the LORD. </t><t>It is an enduring nation; </t><t>it is an ancient nation, </t><t>a nation whose language you do not know, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>nor can you understand what they say.</t>
5-16 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Their quiver is like <f>ⓕ</f>an open tomb; </t><t>they are all mighty warriors.</t>
5-17 <t><f>ⓖ</f> They shall eat up your harvest and your food; </t><t>they shall eat up your sons and your daughters; </t><t>they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; </t><t>they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; </t><t>your <f>ⓗ</f>fortified cities in which you trust </t><t>they shall beat down with the sword.” </t>
5-18 <pb/>“But even in those days, declares the LORD, <f>ⓘ</f>I will not make a full end of you.
5-19 And when your people say, <f>ⓙ</f>‘Why has the LORD our God done all these things to us?’ you shall say to them, ‘As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, <f>ⓚ</f>so you shall serve foreigners in a land that is not yours.’”
5-20 <pb/><t>Declare this in the house of Jacob; </t><t>proclaim it in Judah:</t>
5-21 <t>“Hear this, <f>ⓛ</f>O foolish and senseless people, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>who have eyes, but see not, </t><t>who have ears, but hear not.</t>
5-22 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Do you not fear me? declares the LORD. </t><t>Do you not tremble before me? </t><t>I placed the sand <f>ⓞ</f>as the boundary for the sea, </t><t>a perpetual barrier that it cannot pass; </t><t>though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; </t><t>though <f>ⓟ</f>they roar, they cannot pass over it.</t>
5-23 <t><f>ⓠ</f> But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; </t><t>they have turned aside and gone away.</t>

5-1 <pb/>Now concerning <f>ⓐ</f>the times and the seasons, brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>you have no need to have anything written to you.
5-2 For you yourselves are fully aware that <f>ⓒ</f>the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
5-3 While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then <f>ⓓ</f>sudden destruction will come upon them <f>ⓔ</f>as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
5-4 But you <f>ⓕ</f>are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief.
5-5 For you are all <f>ⓖ</f>children <f>[2]</f> of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness.
5-6 So then <f>ⓗ</f>let us not sleep, as others do, but let us <f>ⓘ</f>keep awake and <f>ⓙ</f>be sober.
5-7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, <f>ⓚ</f>are drunk at night.
5-8 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, <f>ⓛ</f>having put on the breastplate of <f>ⓜ</f>faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
5-9 For God has not destined us for <f>ⓝ</f>wrath, but <f>ⓞ</f>to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
5-10 <f>ⓟ</f> who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him.
5-11 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.
5-12 <pb/>We ask you, brothers, <f>ⓠ</f>to respect those who labor among you and <f>ⓡ</f>are over you in the Lord and admonish you,
5-13 and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. <f>ⓢ</f>Be at peace among yourselves.
5-14 And we urge you, brothers, admonish <f>ⓣ</f>the idle, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>encourage the fainthearted, <f>ⓥ</f>help the weak, <f>ⓦ</f>be patient with them all.
5-15 See that <f>ⓧ</f>no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always <f>ⓨ</f>seek to do good to one another and to everyone.
5-16 <f>ⓩ</f> Rejoice always,
