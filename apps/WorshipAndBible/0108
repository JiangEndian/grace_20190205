5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Naaman, <f>ⓑ</f>commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and in high favor, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. <f>[1]</f>
5-2 Now the Syrians on <f>ⓒ</f>one of their raids had carried off a little girl from the land of Israel, and she worked in the service of Naaman's wife.
5-3 She said to her mistress, “Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.”
5-4 So Naaman went in and told his lord, “Thus and so spoke the girl from the land of Israel.”
5-5 And the king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” <pb/>So he went, <f>ⓓ</f>taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels <f>[2]</f> of gold, and ten <f>ⓔ</f>changes of clothing.
5-6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, “When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you Naaman my servant, that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
5-7 And when the king of Israel read the letter, <f>ⓕ</f>he tore his clothes and said, <f>ⓖ</f>“Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only <f>ⓗ</f>consider, and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me.”
5-8 <pb/>But when Elisha the <f>ⓘ</f>man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come now to me, that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
5-9 So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha's house.
5-10 And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, <f>ⓙ</f>“Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.”
5-11 But Naaman was angry and went away, saying, “Behold, I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call upon the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.
5-12 Are not Abana <f>[3]</f> and Pharpar, the rivers of <f>ⓚ</f>Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.
5-13 But his servants came near and said to him, <f>ⓛ</f>“My father, it is a great word the prophet has spoken to you; will you not do it? Has he actually said to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”
5-14 So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God, <f>ⓜ</f>and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, <f>ⓝ</f>and he was clean.
5-15 <pb/>Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and he came and stood before him. And he said, “Behold, I know that <f>ⓞ</f>there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; so <f>ⓟ</f>accept now a present from your servant.”
5-16 But he said, <f>ⓠ</f>“As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, <f>ⓡ</f>I will receive none.” And he urged him to take it, but he refused.
5-17 Then Naaman said, “If not, please let there be given to your servant two mule loads of earth, for from now on your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the LORD.
5-18 In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of <f>ⓢ</f>Rimmon to worship there, <f>ⓣ</f>leaning on my arm, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this matter.”
5-19 He said to him, <f>ⓤ</f>“Go in peace.” <pb/>But when Naaman had gone from him a short distance,
5-20 <f>ⓥ</f> Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “See, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not accepting from his hand what he brought. <f>ⓦ</f>As the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.”
5-21 So Gehazi followed Naaman. And when Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and said, <f>ⓧ</f>“Is all well?”
5-22 And he said, “All is well. My master has sent me to say, ‘There have just now come to me from <f>ⓨ</f>the hill country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets. Please give them a talent of silver and <f>ⓩ</f>two changes of clothing.’”
5-23 And Naaman said, <f>ⓐ</f>“Be pleased to accept two talents.” And he urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants. And they carried them before Gehazi.
5-24 And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and put them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed.
5-25 He went in and stood before his master, and Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” And he said, “Your servant went nowhere.”
5-26 But he said to him, “Did not my heart go when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male servants and female servants?
5-27 Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.” So he went out from his presence <f>ⓑ</f>a leper, like snow.
4-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And seven women <f>ⓑ</f>shall take hold of <f>ⓒ</f>one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; <f>ⓓ</f>take away our reproach.”
4-2 <pb/>In that day <f>ⓔ</f>the branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and <f>ⓕ</f>the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of Israel.
4-3 <f>ⓖ</f> And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called <f>ⓗ</f>holy, everyone who has <f>ⓘ</f>been recorded for life in Jerusalem,
4-4 when <f>ⓙ</f>the Lord shall have washed away the filth of <f>ⓚ</f>the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by <f>ⓛ</f>a spirit of burning. <f>[1]</f>
4-5 Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies <f>ⓜ</f>a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be <f>ⓝ</f>a canopy.
4-6 <f>ⓞ</f> There will be a <f>ⓟ</f>booth for shade by day from the heat, and <f>ⓠ</f>for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.
2-1 <pb/>Therefore you have <f>ⓐ</f>no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For <f>ⓑ</f>in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.
2-2 We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.
2-3 Do you suppose, O man — you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself — that you will escape the judgment of God?
2-4 Or do you presume on <f>ⓒ</f>the riches of his kindness and <f>ⓓ</f>forbearance and <f>ⓔ</f>patience, <f>ⓕ</f>not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
2-5 But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are <f>ⓖ</f>storing up <f>ⓗ</f>wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
2-6 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> He will render to each one according to his works:
2-7 to those who <f>ⓙ</f>by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;
2-8 but for those who are self-seeking <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓚ</f>do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.
2-9 There will be tribulation and distress <f>ⓛ</f>for every human being who does evil, the Jew <f>ⓜ</f>first and also the Greek,
2-10 but glory and honor and <f>ⓝ</f>peace for everyone who does good, <f>ⓞ</f>the Jew first and also the Greek.
2-11 For <f>ⓟ</f>God shows no partiality.
2-12 <pb/>For all who have sinned <f>ⓠ</f>without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
2-13 For <f>ⓡ</f>it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.
2-14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, <f>ⓢ</f>by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
2-15 They show that the work of the law is <f>ⓣ</f>written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them
2-16 <f>ⓤ</f> on that day when, <f>ⓥ</f>according to my gospel, God judges <f>ⓦ</f>the secrets of men <f>ⓧ</f>by Christ Jesus.
2-17 <pb/>But if you call yourself a Jew and <f>ⓨ</f>rely on the law and boast in God
2-18 and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;
2-19 and if you are sure that you yourself are <f>ⓩ</f>a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
2-20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law <f>ⓐ</f>the embodiment of <f>ⓑ</f>knowledge and truth —
2-21 <f>ⓒ</f> you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?
2-22 You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you <f>ⓓ</f>rob temples?
2-23 You who <f>ⓔ</f>boast in the law <f>ⓕ</f>dishonor God by breaking the law.
2-24 For, <f>ⓖ</f>as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed <f>ⓗ</f>among the Gentiles because of you.”
2-25 <pb/>For circumcision indeed is of value <f>ⓘ</f>if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
2-26 So, if <f>ⓙ</f>a man who is uncircumcised keeps <f>ⓚ</f>the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded <f>[2]</f> as circumcision?
2-27 Then he who is physically <f>[3]</f> uncircumcised but keeps the law <f>ⓛ</f>will condemn you who have <f>ⓜ</f>the written code <f>[4]</f> and circumcision but break the law.
2-28 For <f>ⓝ</f>no one is a Jew <f>ⓞ</f>who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.
2-29 But a Jew is one <f>ⓟ</f>inwardly, and <f>ⓠ</f>circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. <f>ⓡ</f>His praise is not from man but from God.
