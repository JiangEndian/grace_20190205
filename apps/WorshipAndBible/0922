23-1 <pb/>A long time afterward, when the LORD had given <f>ⓐ</f>rest to Israel from all their surrounding enemies, and Joshua <f>ⓑ</f>was old and well advanced in years,
23-2 Joshua <f>ⓒ</f>summoned all Israel, its elders and heads, its judges and officers, and said to them, “I am now old and well advanced in years.
23-3 And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, <f>ⓓ</f>for it is the LORD your God who has fought for you.
23-4 Behold, <f>ⓔ</f>I have allotted to you as an inheritance for your tribes those nations that remain, along with all the nations that I have already cut off, from the Jordan to the Great Sea in the west.
23-5 The LORD your God <f>ⓕ</f>will push them back before you and drive them out of your sight. And you shall possess their land, <f>ⓖ</f>just as the LORD your God promised you.
23-6 Therefore, <f>ⓗ</f>be very strong to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, <f>ⓘ</f>turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left,
23-7 <f>ⓙ</f> that you may not mix with these nations remaining among you <f>ⓚ</f>or make mention of the names of their gods <f>ⓛ</f>or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them,
23-8 <f>ⓜ</f> but you shall cling to the LORD your God just as you have done to this day.
23-9 <f>ⓝ</f> For the LORD has driven out before you great and strong nations. And as for you, <f>ⓞ</f>no man has been able to stand before you to this day.
23-10 <f>ⓟ</f> One man of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the LORD your God <f>ⓠ</f>who fights for you, just as he promised you.
23-11 <f>ⓡ</f> Be very careful, therefore, to love the LORD your God.
23-12 For if you turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations remaining among you <f>ⓢ</f>and make marriages with them, so that you associate with them and they with you,
23-13 know for certain that <f>ⓣ</f>the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you, <f>ⓤ</f>but they shall be a snare and a trap for you, a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good ground that the LORD your God has given you.
23-14 <pb/>“And now <f>ⓥ</f>I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that <f>ⓦ</f>not one word has failed of all the good things <f>[1]</f> that the LORD your God promised concerning you. All have come to pass for you; not one of them has failed.
23-15 But just as all the good things that the LORD your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the LORD will bring upon you <f>ⓧ</f>all the evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land that the LORD your God has given you,
23-16 if you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them. Then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land that he has given to you.”
97-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> The LORD reigns, <f>ⓑ</f>let the earth rejoice; </t><t>let the many <f>ⓒ</f>coastlands be glad!</t>
97-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.</t>
97-3 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Fire goes before him </t><t>and burns up his adversaries all around.</t>
97-4 <t>His <f>ⓖ</f>lightnings light up the world; </t><t>the earth sees and <f>ⓗ</f>trembles.</t>
97-5 <t>The mountains <f>ⓘ</f>melt like <f>ⓙ</f>wax before the LORD, </t><t>before <f>ⓚ</f>the Lord of all the earth. </t>
97-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓛ</f> The heavens proclaim his righteousness, </t><t>and all <f>ⓜ</f>the peoples see his glory.</t>
97-7 <t>All worshipers of images are <f>ⓝ</f>put to shame, </t><t>who make their boast in <f>ⓞ</f>worthless idols; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>worship him, all you gods! </t>
97-8 <pb/><t>Zion hears and <f>ⓠ</f>is glad, </t><t>and the daughters of Judah rejoice, </t><t>because of your judgments, O LORD.</t>
97-9 <t>For you, O LORD, are <f>ⓡ</f>most high over all the earth; </t><t>you are exalted far above <f>ⓢ</f>all gods. </t>
97-10 <pb/><t>O you who love the LORD, <f>ⓣ</f>hate evil! </t><t>He <f>ⓤ</f>preserves the lives of his <f>ⓥ</f>saints; </t><t>he <f>ⓦ</f>delivers them from the hand of the wicked.</t>
97-11 <t><f>ⓧ</f> Light <f>ⓨ</f>is sown <f>[1]</f> for the righteous, </t><t>and joy for the upright in heart.</t>
97-12 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>give thanks to his holy name! </t>
11-1 <pb/>When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
11-2 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now when John heard <f>ⓑ</f>in prison about the deeds of <f>ⓒ</f>the Christ, he sent word by <f>ⓓ</f>his disciples
11-3 and said to him, “Are you <f>ⓔ</f>the one who is to come, or shall we <f>ⓕ</f>look for another?”
11-4 And Jesus answered them, <J>“Go and tell John what you hear and see:</J>
11-5 <J><f>ⓖ</f> the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers <f>[1]</f> are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and <f>ⓗ</f>the poor have good news preached to them.</J>
11-6 <J>And blessed is the one who <f>ⓘ</f>is not offended by me.”</J>
11-7 <pb/>As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: <J>“What did you go out <f>ⓙ</f>into the wilderness to see? <f>ⓚ</f>A reed shaken by the wind?</J>
11-8 <J>What then did you go out to see? A man <f>[2]</f> dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.</J>
11-9 <J>What then did you go out to see? <f>ⓛ</f>A prophet? <f>[3]</f> Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</J>
11-10 <J>This is he of whom it is written,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓜ</f>“‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,</J> </t><t><J>who will prepare your way before you.’</J> </t>
11-11 <pb/><J>Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</J>
11-12 <J><f>ⓝ</f> From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, <f>[4]</f> and the violent take it by force.</J>
11-13 <J><f>ⓞ</f> For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John,</J>
11-14 <J>and if you are willing to accept it, he is <f>ⓟ</f>Elijah who is to come.</J>
11-15 <J><f>ⓠ</f> He who has ears to hear, <f>[5]</f> let him hear.</J>
11-16 <pb/><J>“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,</J>
11-17 <pb/><t><J>“‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;</J> </t><t><J>we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’</J> </t>
11-18 <pb/><J>For John came <f>ⓡ</f>neither eating <f>ⓢ</f>nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’</J>
11-19 <J>The Son of Man came <f>ⓣ</f>eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, <f>ⓤ</f>a friend of <f>ⓥ</f>tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.” <f>[6]</f></J>
11-20 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
11-21 <J><f>ⓧ</f> “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in <f>ⓨ</f>Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</J>
11-22 <J><f>ⓩ</f> But I tell you, it will be more bearable on <f>ⓐ</f>the day of judgment for <f>ⓑ</f>Tyre and Sidon than for you.</J>
11-23 <J>And you, <f>ⓒ</f>Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to <f>ⓓ</f>Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</J>
11-24 <J><f>ⓔ</f> But I tell you that <f>ⓕ</f>it will be more tolerable on <f>ⓖ</f>the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.”</J>
11-25 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> At that time Jesus declared, <J>“I thank you, Father, <f>ⓘ</f>Lord of heaven and earth, that <f>ⓙ</f>you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and <f>ⓚ</f>revealed them to little children;</J>
11-26 <J>yes, Father, for such was your <f>ⓛ</f>gracious will. <f>[7]</f></J>
11-27 <J><f>ⓜ</f> All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son <f>ⓝ</f>except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone <f>ⓞ</f>to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</J>
11-28 <J><f>ⓟ</f> Come to <f>ⓠ</f>me, all who labor and are <f>ⓡ</f>heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</J>
11-29 <J>Take my yoke upon you, and <f>ⓢ</f>learn from me, for I am <f>ⓣ</f>gentle and lowly in heart, and <f>ⓤ</f>you will find rest for your souls.</J>
11-30 <J>For <f>ⓥ</f>my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”</J>
