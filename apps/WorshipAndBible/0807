11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “You shall therefore love the LORD your God and <f>ⓑ</f>keep his charge, his statutes, his rules, and his commandments always.
11-2 And consider today (since I am not speaking to <f>ⓒ</f>your children who have not known or seen it), consider the discipline <f>[1]</f> of the LORD your God, <f>ⓓ</f>his greatness, <f>ⓔ</f>his mighty hand and his outstretched arm,
11-3 <f>ⓕ</f> his signs and his deeds that he did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land,
11-4 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and to their chariots, <f>ⓖ</f>how he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them to this day,
11-5 and <f>ⓗ</f>what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place,
11-6 and <f>ⓘ</f>what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel.
11-7 For your eyes have seen <f>ⓙ</f>all the great work of the LORD that he did.
11-8 <pb/>“You shall therefore keep the whole commandment that I command you today, that you may <f>ⓚ</f>be strong, and go in and take possession of the land that you are going over to possess,
11-9 and <f>ⓛ</f>that you may live long in the land <f>ⓜ</f>that the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them and to their offspring, <f>ⓝ</f>a land flowing with milk and honey.
11-10 For the land that you are entering to take possession of it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated it, <f>[2]</f> like a garden of vegetables.
11-11 <f>ⓞ</f> But the land that you are going over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water by the rain from heaven,
11-12 a land that the LORD your God cares for. <f>ⓟ</f>The eyes of the LORD your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
11-13 <pb/>“And if you will indeed obey my commandments that I command you today, <f>ⓠ</f>to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
11-14 <f>ⓡ</f> he <f>[3]</f> will give the rain for your land in its season, <f>ⓢ</f>the early rain and the later rain, that you may gather in your grain and your wine and your oil.
11-15 <f>ⓣ</f> And he will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and <f>ⓤ</f>you shall eat and be full.
11-16 Take care <f>ⓥ</f>lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and <f>ⓦ</f>serve other gods and worship them;
11-17 then <f>ⓧ</f>the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and he <f>ⓨ</f>will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will yield no fruit, and <f>ⓩ</f>you will perish quickly off the good land that the LORD is giving you.
11-18 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and <f>ⓑ</f>you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
11-19 You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise.
11-20 <f>ⓒ</f> You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
11-21 <f>ⓓ</f> that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, <f>ⓔ</f>as long as the heavens are above the earth.
11-22 For if <f>ⓕ</f>you will be careful to do all this commandment that I command you to do, loving the LORD your God, walking in all his ways, and <f>ⓖ</f>holding fast to him,
11-23 then the LORD <f>ⓗ</f>will drive out all these nations before you, and you will <f>ⓘ</f>dispossess nations greater and mightier than you.
11-24 <f>ⓙ</f> Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours. Your territory shall be <f>ⓚ</f>from the wilderness to <f>[4]</f> the Lebanon and from the River, the river Euphrates, to the western sea.
11-25 <f>ⓛ</f> No one shall be able to stand against you. The LORD your God will lay <f>ⓜ</f>the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread, <f>ⓝ</f>as he promised you.
11-26 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> “See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse:
11-27 <f>ⓟ</f> the blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you today,
11-28 and <f>ⓠ</f>the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way that I am commanding you today, <f>ⓡ</f>to go after other gods that you have not known.
11-29 And when the LORD your God brings you into the land that you are entering to take possession of it, you shall set <f>ⓢ</f>the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
11-30 Are they not beyond the Jordan, west of the road, toward the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the <f>ⓣ</f>Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside <f>ⓤ</f>the oak <f>[5]</f> of Moreh?
11-31 For you are <f>ⓥ</f>to cross over the Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you. And when you possess it and live in it,
11-32 you shall be careful <f>ⓦ</f>to do all the statutes and the rules that I am setting before you today.
51-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f> Have mercy on me, <f>[1]</f> O God, </t><t>according to your steadfast love; </t><t>according to your <f>ⓒ</f>abundant mercy </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>blot out my transgressions.</t>
51-2 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>cleanse me from my sin! </t>
51-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> For I know my transgressions, </t><t>and my sin is ever before me.</t>
51-4 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Against you, you only, have I sinned </t><t>and done what is evil <f>ⓘ</f>in your sight, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>so that you may be justified in your words </t><t>and blameless in your judgment.</t>
51-5 <t>Behold, <f>ⓚ</f>I was brought forth in iniquity, </t><t>and in sin did my mother conceive me.</t>
51-6 <t>Behold, you delight in truth in <f>ⓛ</f>the inward being, </t><t>and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart. </t>
51-7 <pb/><t>Purge me <f>ⓜ</f>with hyssop, and I shall be clean; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>wash me, and I shall be <f>ⓞ</f>whiter than snow.</t>
51-8 <t>Let me hear joy and gladness; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>let the bones <f>ⓠ</f>that you have broken rejoice.</t>
51-9 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Hide your face from my sins, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>blot out all my iniquities.</t>
51-10 <t><f>ⓣ</f> Create in me a <f>ⓤ</f>clean heart, O God, </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>renew a right <f>[2]</f> spirit within me.</t>

51-12 <t>Restore to me the joy of your salvation, </t><t>and uphold me with a willing spirit. </t>
51-13 <pb/><t>Then I will teach transgressors your ways, </t><t>and sinners will <f>ⓨ</f>return to you.</t>
51-14 <t>Deliver me from <f>ⓩ</f>bloodguiltiness, O God, </t><t>O <f>ⓐ</f>God of my salvation, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>my tongue will sing aloud of your <f>ⓒ</f>righteousness.</t>
51-15 <t>O Lord, open my lips, </t><t>and my mouth will declare your praise.</t>
51-16 <t><f>ⓓ</f> For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; </t><t>you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.</t>
51-17 <t>The sacrifices of God are <f>ⓔ</f>a broken spirit; </t><t>a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. </t>
51-18 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>build up the walls of Jerusalem;</t>

1-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD that came to Micah <f>ⓐ</f>of Moresheth <f>ⓑ</f>in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw <f>ⓒ</f>concerning <f>ⓓ</f>Samaria and Jerusalem.

1-4 <t>And <f>ⓛ</f>the mountains will melt under him, </t><t>and the valleys will split open, </t><t>like wax before the fire, </t><t>like waters poured down a steep place.</t>
1-5 <t>All this is for <f>ⓜ</f>the transgression of Jacob </t><t>and for the sins of the house of Israel. </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>What is the transgression of Jacob? </t><t>Is it not <f>ⓞ</f>Samaria? </t><t>And what is <f>ⓟ</f>the high place of Judah? </t><t>Is it not Jerusalem?</t>

1-7 <t>All <f>ⓤ</f>her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>all her wages shall be burned with fire, </t><t>and all her idols I will lay waste, </t><t>for from <f>ⓦ</f>the fee of a prostitute she gathered them, </t><t>and to the fee of a prostitute they shall return. </t>
1-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f> For this I will lament and wail; </t><t>I will go <f>ⓨ</f>stripped and naked; </t><t>I will make lamentation <f>ⓩ</f>like the jackals, </t><t>and mourning <f>ⓐ</f>like the ostriches.</t>
