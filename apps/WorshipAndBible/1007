Judges 14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Samson went down to <f>ⓑ</f>Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines.
Judges 14-2 Then he came up and told his father and mother, “I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah. <f>ⓒ</f>Now get her for me as my wife.”
Judges 14-3 But his father and mother said to him, “Is there not a woman among the daughters <f>ⓓ</f>of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the <f>ⓔ</f>uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes.”
Judges 14-4 <pb/>His father and mother did not know that it was <f>ⓕ</f>from the LORD, for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. <f>ⓖ</f>At that time the Philistines ruled over Israel.
Judges 14-5 <pb/>Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came toward him roaring.
Judges 14-6 <f>ⓗ</f> Then the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
Judges 14-7 Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she was right in Samson's eyes.
Judges 14-8 <pb/>After some days he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
Judges 14-9 He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion.
Judges 14-10 <pb/>His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for so the young men used to do.
Judges 14-11 As soon as the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Judges 14-12 And Samson said to them, <f>ⓘ</f>“Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can tell me what it is, within <f>ⓙ</f>the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty <f>ⓚ</f>changes of clothes,
Judges 14-13 but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.” And they said to him, “Put your riddle, that we may hear it.”
Judges 14-14 And he said to them, <pb/><t>“Out of the eater came something to eat. </t><t>Out of the strong came something sweet.” </t> <pb/>And in three days they could not solve the riddle.
Judges 14-15 <pb/>On the fourth <f>[1]</f> day they said to Samson's wife, <f>ⓛ</f>“Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is, <f>ⓜ</f>lest we burn you and your father's house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?”
Judges 14-16 And Samson's wife wept over him and said, <f>ⓝ</f>“You only hate me; you do not love me. You have put a riddle to my people, and you have not told me what it is.” And he said to her, “Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?”
Judges 14-17 She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because <f>ⓞ</f>she pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her people.
Judges 14-18 And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, <pb/><t>“What is sweeter than honey? </t><t>What is stronger than a lion?” </t> <pb/>And he said to them, <pb/><t>“If you had not plowed with my heifer, </t><t>you would not have found out my riddle.” </t>
Judges 14-19 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and he went down to <f>ⓠ</f>Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of the town and took their spoil and gave the garments to those who had told the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father's house.
Judges 14-20 And Samson's wife was given to <f>ⓡ</f>his companion, <f>ⓢ</f>who had been his best man.

Matthew 26-1 <pb/>When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,
Matthew 26-2 <J><f>ⓐ</f> “You know that after two days <f>ⓑ</f>the Passover is coming, and <f>ⓒ</f>the Son of Man <f>ⓓ</f>will be delivered up to be crucified.”</J>
Matthew 26-3 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in <f>ⓕ</f>the palace of the high priest, whose name was <f>ⓖ</f>Caiaphas,
Matthew 26-4 <f>ⓗ</f> and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
Matthew 26-5 But they said, “Not during the feast, <f>ⓘ</f>lest there be an uproar among the people.”
Matthew 26-6 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Now when Jesus was at <f>ⓚ</f>Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, <f>[1]</f>
Matthew 26-7 a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table.
Matthew 26-8 And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste?
Matthew 26-9 For this could have been sold for a large sum and <f>ⓛ</f>given to the poor.”
Matthew 26-10 But <f>ⓜ</f>Jesus, aware of this, said to them, <J>“Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</J>
Matthew 26-11 <J>For <f>ⓝ</f>you always have the poor with you, but <f>ⓞ</f>you will not always have me.</J>
Matthew 26-12 <J>In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it <f>ⓟ</f>to prepare me for burial.</J>
Matthew 26-13 <J>Truly, I say to you, wherever <f>ⓠ</f>this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told <f>ⓡ</f>in memory of her.”</J>
Matthew 26-14 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> Then one of the twelve, whose name was <f>ⓣ</f>Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
Matthew 26-15 and said, “What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?” And they <f>ⓤ</f>paid him <f>ⓥ</f>thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew 26-16 And from that moment he sought an opportunity <f>ⓦ</f>to betray him.
Matthew 26-17 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> Now on <f>ⓨ</f>the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
Matthew 26-18 He said, <J>“Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, <f>ⓩ</f>‘The Teacher says, <f>ⓐ</f>My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”</J>
Matthew 26-19 And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
Matthew 26-20 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve. <f>[2]</f>
Matthew 26-21 And as they were eating, <f>ⓒ</f>he said, <J>“Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”</J>
Matthew 26-22 And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, “Is it I, Lord?”
Matthew 26-23 He answered, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.</J>
Matthew 26-24 <J>The Son of Man goes <f>ⓔ</f>as it is written of him, but <f>ⓕ</f>woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! <f>ⓖ</f>It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”</J>
Matthew 26-25 Judas, who would betray him, answered, “Is it I, <f>ⓗ</f>Rabbi?” He said to him, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“You have said so.”</J>
Matthew 26-26 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and <f>ⓚ</f>after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, <J>“Take, eat; <f>ⓛ</f>this is my body.”</J>
Matthew 26-27 And he took a cup, and when he <f>ⓜ</f>had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, <J>“Drink of it, all of you,</J>
Matthew 26-28 <J>for <f>ⓝ</f>this is my <f>ⓞ</f>blood of the <f>[3]</f> covenant, which is poured out for <f>ⓟ</f>many <f>ⓠ</f>for the forgiveness of sins.</J>
Matthew 26-29 <J>I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you <f>ⓡ</f>in my Father's kingdom.”</J>
Matthew 26-30 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> And when they had sung a hymn, <f>ⓣ</f>they went out to <f>ⓤ</f>the Mount of Olives.
Matthew 26-31 Then Jesus said to them, <J>“You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, ‘I will <f>ⓥ</f>strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</J>
Matthew 26-32 <J>But after I am raised up, <f>ⓦ</f>I will go before you to Galilee.”</J>
Matthew 26-33 <f>ⓧ</f> Peter answered him, “Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.”
Matthew 26-34 <f>ⓨ</f> Jesus said to him, <J>“Truly, I tell you, this very night, <f>ⓩ</f>before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</J>
Matthew 26-35 <f>ⓐ</f> Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!” And all the disciples said the same.
Matthew 26-36 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Then Jesus went with them <f>ⓒ</f>to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, <J>“Sit here, while I go over there and pray.”</J>
Matthew 26-37 And taking with him <f>ⓓ</f>Peter and <f>ⓔ</f>the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
Matthew 26-38 Then he said to them, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and <f>ⓖ</f>watch <f>[4]</f> with me.”</J>
Matthew 26-39 And going a little farther he fell on his face <f>ⓗ</f>and prayed, saying, <J>“My Father, if it be possible, let <f>ⓘ</f>this cup pass from me; <f>ⓙ</f>nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”</J>
Matthew 26-40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, <J>“So, could you not watch with me one hour?</J>
Matthew 26-41 <J><f>ⓚ</f> Watch and <f>ⓛ</f>pray that you <f>ⓜ</f>may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</J>
Matthew 26-42 Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, <J>“My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, <f>ⓝ</f>your will be done.”</J>
Matthew 26-43 And again he came and found them sleeping, for <f>ⓞ</f>their eyes were heavy.
Matthew 26-44 So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for <f>ⓟ</f>the third time, saying the same words again.
Matthew 26-45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, <J>“Sleep and take your rest later on. <f>[5]</f> See, <f>ⓠ</f>the hour is at hand, and <f>ⓡ</f>the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</J>
Matthew 26-46 <J>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”</J>
Matthew 26-47 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> While he was still speaking, <f>ⓣ</f>Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Matthew 26-48 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.”
Matthew 26-49 And he came up to Jesus at once and said, “Greetings, <f>ⓤ</f>Rabbi!” And he kissed him.
Matthew 26-50 Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“Friend, <f>ⓦ</f>do what you came to do.” <f>[6]</f></J> Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
Matthew 26-51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his <f>ⓧ</f>sword and struck the servant <f>[7]</f> of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Matthew 26-52 Then Jesus said to him, <J>“Put your sword back into its place. For <f>ⓨ</f>all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</J>
Matthew 26-53 <J><f>ⓩ</f> Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me <f>ⓐ</f>more than twelve <f>ⓑ</f>legions of angels?</J>
Matthew 26-54 <J><f>ⓒ</f> But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?”</J>
Matthew 26-55 At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, <J>“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day <f>ⓓ</f>I sat in the temple <f>ⓔ</f>teaching, and you did not seize me.</J>
Matthew 26-56 <J>But <f>ⓕ</f>all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</J> <f>ⓖ</f>Then all the disciples left him and fled.
Matthew 26-57 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Then <f>ⓘ</f>those who had seized Jesus led him to <f>ⓙ</f>Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
Matthew 26-58 And <f>ⓚ</f>Peter was following him at a distance, as far as <f>ⓛ</f>the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with <f>ⓜ</f>the guards to see the end.
Matthew 26-59 Now the chief priests and the whole council <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,
Matthew 26-60 but they found none, <f>ⓞ</f>though many false witnesses came forward. At last <f>ⓟ</f>two came forward
Matthew 26-61 and said, “This man said, <f>ⓠ</f>‘I am able to <f>ⓡ</f>destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.’”
Matthew 26-62 And the high priest stood up and said, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?” <f>[9]</f>
Matthew 26-63 <f>ⓢ</f> But Jesus remained silent. <f>ⓣ</f>And the high priest said to him, <f>ⓤ</f>“I adjure you by <f>ⓥ</f>the living God, <f>ⓦ</f>tell us if you are <f>ⓧ</f>the Christ, <f>ⓨ</f>the Son of God.”
Matthew 26-64 Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓩ</f>“You have said so. But I tell you, from now on <f>ⓐ</f>you will see the Son of Man <f>ⓑ</f>seated at the right hand of Power and <f>ⓒ</f>coming on the clouds of heaven.”</J>
Matthew 26-65 Then the high priest <f>ⓓ</f>tore his robes and said, <f>ⓔ</f>“He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy.
Matthew 26-66 What is your judgment?” They answered, <f>ⓕ</f>“He deserves death.”
Matthew 26-67 Then <f>ⓖ</f>they spit in his face <f>ⓗ</f>and <f>ⓘ</f>struck him. And some slapped him,
Matthew 26-68 saying, “Prophesy to us, you <f>ⓙ</f>Christ! Who is it that struck you?”
Matthew 26-69 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Now Peter was sitting outside <f>ⓛ</f>in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”
Matthew 26-70 But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean.”
Matthew 26-71 And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, “This man was with Jesus <f>ⓜ</f>of Nazareth.”
Matthew 26-72 And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man.”
Matthew 26-73 After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you too are one of them, for <f>ⓝ</f>your accent betrays you.”
Matthew 26-74 Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know the man.” And immediately the rooster crowed.
Matthew 26-75 And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“Before the rooster crows, you will <f>ⓟ</f>deny me three times.”</J> And he went out and wept bitterly.
