1 Kings 13-1 <pb/>And behold, <f>ⓐ</f>a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel. Jeroboam was standing by the altar <f>ⓑ</f>to make offerings.
1 Kings 13-2 <f>ⓒ</f> And the man cried against the altar by the word of the LORD and said, “O altar, altar, thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, <f>ⓓ</f>Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make offerings on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.’”
1 Kings 13-3 And he gave <f>ⓔ</f>a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign that the LORD has spoken: ‘Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.’”
1 Kings 13-4 And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him.” And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
1 Kings 13-5 The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
1 Kings 13-6 And the king said to the man of God, <f>ⓕ</f>“Entreat now the favor of the LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.” And the man of God entreated the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him and became as it was before.
1 Kings 13-7 And the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and <f>ⓖ</f>I will give you a reward.”
1 Kings 13-8 And the man of God said to the king, <f>ⓗ</f>“If you give me half your house, <f>ⓘ</f>I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place,
1 Kings 13-9 for so was it commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘You shall neither eat bread nor drink water nor return by the way that you came.’”
1 Kings 13-10 So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.
1 Kings 13-11 <pb/>Now <f>ⓙ</f>an old prophet lived in Bethel. And his sons <f>[1]</f> came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told to their father the words that he had spoken to the king.
1 Kings 13-12 And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
1 Kings 13-13 And he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it.
1 Kings 13-14 And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.”
1 Kings 13-15 Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”
1 Kings 13-16 And he said, <f>ⓚ</f>“I may not return with you, or go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place,
1 Kings 13-17 for it was said to me <f>ⓛ</f>by the word of the LORD, ‘You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.’”
1 Kings 13-18 And he said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.’” But he lied to him.
1 Kings 13-19 So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.
1 Kings 13-20 <pb/>And as they sat at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back.
1 Kings 13-21 And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD and have not kept the command that the LORD your God commanded you,
1 Kings 13-22 but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no bread and drink no water,” your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.’”
1 Kings 13-23 And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.
1 Kings 13-24 And as he went away <f>ⓜ</f>a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body.
1 Kings 13-25 And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown in the road and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where <f>ⓝ</f>the old prophet lived.
1 Kings 13-26 <pb/>And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD spoke to him.”
1 Kings 13-27 And he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And they saddled it.
1 Kings 13-28 And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or torn the donkey.
1 Kings 13-29 And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back to the city <f>[2]</f> to mourn and to bury him.
1 Kings 13-30 And he laid the body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, saying, <f>ⓞ</f>“Alas, my brother!”
1 Kings 13-31 And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; <f>ⓟ</f>lay my bones beside his bones.
1 Kings 13-32 <f>ⓠ</f> For the saying that he called out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against <f>ⓡ</f>all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of <f>ⓢ</f>Samaria shall surely come to pass.”
1 Kings 13-33 <pb/>After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people. Any who would, he ordained to be priests of the high places.
1 Kings 13-34 <f>ⓣ</f> And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, <f>ⓤ</f>so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.

Acts 16-1 <pb/>Paul <f>[1]</f> came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named <f>ⓐ</f>Timothy, <f>ⓑ</f>the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.
Acts 16-2 He was well spoken of by <f>ⓒ</f>the brothers <f>[2]</f> at Lystra and Iconium.
Acts 16-3 Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he <f>ⓓ</f>took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts 16-4 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance <f>ⓔ</f>the decisions <f>ⓕ</f>that had been reached by <f>ⓖ</f>the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
Acts 16-5 <f>ⓗ</f> So the churches were strengthened in <f>ⓘ</f>the faith, and they increased in numbers <f>ⓙ</f>daily.
Acts 16-6 <pb/>And <f>ⓚ</f>they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
Acts 16-7 And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but <f>ⓛ</f>the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
Acts 16-8 So, passing by Mysia, they went down <f>ⓜ</f>to Troas.
Acts 16-9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”
Acts 16-10 And when Paul <f>[3]</f> had seen the vision, immediately <f>ⓝ</f>we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
Acts 16-11 <pb/>So, setting sail from Troas, we <f>ⓞ</f>made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis,
Acts 16-12 and from there to <f>ⓟ</f>Philippi, which is a leading city of the <f>[4]</f> district of Macedonia and <f>ⓠ</f>a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days.
Acts 16-13 And <f>ⓡ</f>on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate <f>ⓢ</f>to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we <f>ⓣ</f>sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
Acts 16-14 One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, <f>ⓤ</f>who was a worshiper of God. The Lord <f>ⓥ</f>opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.
Acts 16-15 And after she was baptized, <f>ⓦ</f>and her household as well, she urged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” And she <f>ⓧ</f>prevailed upon us.
Acts 16-16 <pb/>As we were going to <f>ⓨ</f>the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had <f>ⓩ</f>a spirit of <f>ⓐ</f>divination and <f>ⓑ</f>brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling.
Acts 16-17 She followed Paul and us, <f>ⓒ</f>crying out, “These men are <f>ⓓ</f>servants of <f>ⓔ</f>the Most High God, who proclaim to you <f>ⓕ</f>the way of salvation.”
Acts 16-18 And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, <f>ⓖ</f>“I command you <f>ⓗ</f>in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And <f>ⓘ</f>it came out that very hour.
Acts 16-19 <pb/>But <f>ⓙ</f>when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and <f>ⓚ</f>dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
Acts 16-20 And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city.
Acts 16-21 They <f>ⓛ</f>advocate customs that are not lawful for us <f>ⓜ</f>as Romans to accept or practice.”
Acts 16-22 The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders <f>ⓝ</f>to beat them with rods.
Acts 16-23 And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.
Acts 16-24 Having received this order, he put them into the inner <f>ⓞ</f>prison and fastened their feet in <f>ⓟ</f>the stocks.
Acts 16-25 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,
Acts 16-26 and suddenly <f>ⓡ</f>there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately <f>ⓢ</f>all the doors were opened, and <f>ⓣ</f>everyone's bonds were unfastened.
Acts 16-27 When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and <f>ⓤ</f>was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts 16-28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.”
Acts 16-29 And the jailer <f>[5]</f> called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he <f>ⓥ</f>fell down before Paul and Silas.
Acts 16-30 Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, <f>ⓦ</f>what must I do to be <f>ⓧ</f>saved?”
Acts 16-31 And they said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you <f>ⓩ</f>and your household.”
Acts 16-32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
Acts 16-33 And he took them <f>ⓐ</f>the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he <f>ⓑ</f>was baptized at once, he and all his family.
Acts 16-34 Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he <f>ⓒ</f>rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.
Acts 16-35 <pb/>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, “Let those men go.”
Acts 16-36 And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.”
Acts 16-37 But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us publicly, <f>ⓓ</f>uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.”
Acts 16-38 The police reported these words to the magistrates, and <f>ⓔ</f>they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.
Acts 16-39 So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and <f>ⓕ</f>asked them to leave the city.
Acts 16-40 So they went out of the prison and visited <f>ⓖ</f>Lydia. And when they had seen <f>ⓗ</f>the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.
