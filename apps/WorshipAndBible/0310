Genesis 14-1 <pb/>In the days of Amraphel king of <f>ⓐ</f>Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of <f>ⓑ</f>Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
Genesis 14-2 these kings made war with <f>ⓒ</f>Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of <f>ⓓ</f>Admah, Shemeber king of <f>ⓔ</f>Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
Genesis 14-3 And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (<f>ⓕ</f>that is, the Salt Sea).
Genesis 14-4 Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis 14-5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the <f>ⓖ</f>Rephaim in <f>ⓗ</f>Ashteroth-karnaim, the <f>ⓘ</f>Zuzim in Ham, the <f>ⓙ</f>Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
Genesis 14-6 and the <f>ⓚ</f>Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as <f>ⓛ</f>El-paran on the border of the wilderness.
Genesis 14-7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, <f>ⓜ</f>Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling <f>ⓝ</f>in Hazazon-tamar.
Genesis 14-8 <pb/>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim
Genesis 14-9 with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five.
Genesis 14-10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of <f>ⓞ</f>bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled <f>ⓟ</f>to the hill country.
Genesis 14-11 So the enemy took <f>ⓠ</f>all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
Genesis 14-12 They also took Lot, <f>ⓡ</f>the son of Abram's brother, <f>ⓢ</f>who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way.
Genesis 14-13 <pb/>Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, <f>ⓣ</f>who was living by the <f>ⓤ</f>oaks <f>[1]</f> of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram.
Genesis 14-14 When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, <f>ⓥ</f>born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as <f>ⓦ</f>Dan.
Genesis 14-15 And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus.
Genesis 14-16 Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot <f>ⓧ</f>with his possessions, and the women and the people.
Genesis 14-17 <pb/>After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the <f>ⓨ</f>King's Valley).
Genesis 14-18 And <f>ⓩ</f>Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was <f>ⓐ</f>priest of <f>ⓑ</f>God Most High.)
Genesis 14-19 And he blessed him and said, <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Blessed be Abram by God Most High, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>Possessor <f>[2]</f> of heaven and earth;</t>
Genesis 14-20 <t>and blessed be God Most High, </t><t>who has delivered your enemies into your hand!” </t> <pb/>And Abram gave him <f>ⓔ</f>a tenth of everything.
Genesis 14-21 And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.”
Genesis 14-22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, <f>ⓕ</f>“I have lifted my hand <f>[3]</f> to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis 14-23 that <f>ⓖ</f>I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’
Genesis 14-24 I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let <f>ⓗ</f>Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.”
2 Chronicles 12-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> When the rule of Rehoboam was established <f>ⓑ</f>and he was strong, <f>ⓒ</f>he abandoned the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
2 Chronicles 12-2 <f>ⓓ</f> In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, <f>ⓔ</f>Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem
2 Chronicles 12-3 with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him from Egypt — <f>ⓕ</f>Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles 12-4 And he took <f>ⓖ</f>the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 12-5 Then <f>ⓗ</f>Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the LORD, <f>ⓘ</f>‘You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you to the hand of Shishak.’”
2 Chronicles 12-6 Then the princes of <f>ⓙ</f>Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, <f>ⓚ</f>“The LORD is righteous.”
2 Chronicles 12-7 When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah: <f>ⓛ</f>“They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, <f>ⓜ</f>and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
2 Chronicles 12-8 Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him, <f>ⓝ</f>that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.”
2 Chronicles 12-9 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house. He took away everything. He also took away <f>ⓟ</f>the shields of gold that Solomon had made,
2 Chronicles 12-10 and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
2 Chronicles 12-11 And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.
2 Chronicles 12-12 And when <f>ⓠ</f>he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction. Moreover, <f>ⓡ</f>conditions were good <f>[1]</f> in Judah.
2 Chronicles 12-13 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> So King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
2 Chronicles 12-14 And he did evil, <f>ⓣ</f>for he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.
2 Chronicles 12-15 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> Now the acts of Rehoboam, <f>ⓥ</f>from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of <f>ⓦ</f>Shemaiah the prophet and of <f>ⓧ</f>Iddo <f>ⓨ</f>the seer? <f>[2]</f> There were continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles 12-16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and <f>ⓩ</f>Abijah <f>[3]</f> his son reigned in his place.
Isaiah 65-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> I was ready to be sought by <f>ⓑ</f>those who did not ask for me; </t><t>I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. </t><t>I said, “Here I am, here I am,” </t><t>to a nation that was not called by <f>[1]</f> my name.</t>

Isaiah 65-5 <t>who say, “Keep to yourself, </t><t>do not come near me, for I am too holy for you.” </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>These are a smoke in my nostrils, </t><t>a fire that burns all the day.</t>
Isaiah 65-6 <t>Behold, <f>ⓖ</f>it is written before me: </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>“I will not keep silent, but I will repay; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>I will indeed repay into their lap</t>
Isaiah 65-7 <t>both your iniquities <f>ⓙ</f>and your fathers' iniquities together, <pb/>says the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>because they made offerings on the mountains </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>and insulted me on the hills, </t><t>I will measure into their lap </t><t>payment for their former deeds.” <f>[2]</f> </t>
Isaiah 65-8 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>“As the new wine is found in the cluster, </t><t>and they say, ‘Do not destroy it, </t><t>for there is a blessing in it,’ </t><t>so I will do for my servants' sake, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>and not destroy them all.</t>
Isaiah 65-9 <t><f>ⓞ</f> I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, </t><t>and from Judah possessors of my mountains; </t><t>my chosen shall possess it, </t><t>and my servants shall dwell there.</t>
Isaiah 65-10 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, </t><t>for my people <f>ⓡ</f>who have sought me.</t>
Isaiah 65-11 <t>But <f>ⓢ</f>you who forsake the LORD, </t><t>who forget <f>ⓣ</f>my holy mountain, </t><t>who <f>ⓤ</f>set a table for Fortune </t><t>and <f>ⓥ</f>fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,</t>
Isaiah 65-12 <t>I will destine you to the sword, </t><t>and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>because, when I called, you did not answer; </t><t>when I spoke, you did not listen, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>but you did what was evil in my eyes </t><t>and chose what I did not delight in.” </t>
Isaiah 65-13 <pb/><t>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: </t><t>“Behold, <f>ⓨ</f>my servants shall eat, </t><t>but you shall be hungry; </t><t>behold, my servants shall drink, </t><t>but you shall be thirsty; </t><t>behold, my servants shall rejoice, </t><t>but you shall be put to shame;</t>

Isaiah 65-15 <t>You shall leave your name to <f>ⓐ</f>my chosen <f>ⓑ</f>for a curse, </t><t>and the Lord GOD will put you to death, </t><t>but his servants <f>ⓒ</f>he will call by another name,</t>
Isaiah 65-16 <t>so that he who <f>ⓓ</f>blesses himself in the land </t><t>shall bless himself by <f>ⓔ</f>the God of truth, </t><t>and he who takes an oath in the land </t><t>shall swear by <f>ⓕ</f>the God of truth; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>because the former troubles are forgotten </t><t>and are hidden from my eyes. </t>
