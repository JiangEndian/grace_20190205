1 Chronicles 9-1 <pb/>So all Israel was recorded in genealogies, and these are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel. And <f>ⓐ</f>Judah was taken into exile in Babylon because of their breach of faith.
1 Chronicles 9-2 <f>ⓑ</f> Now the first to <f>ⓒ</f>dwell again in their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the <f>ⓓ</f>temple servants.
1 Chronicles 9-3 And some of the people of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh lived in Jerusalem:

1 Chronicles 9-19 Shallum the son of Kore, son of <f>ⓛ</f>Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his kinsmen of his fathers' house, the <f>ⓜ</f>Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent, as their fathers had been in charge of the camp of the LORD, keepers of the entrance.
1 Chronicles 9-20 And <f>ⓝ</f>Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the chief officer over them in time past; the LORD was with him.
1 Chronicles 9-21 <f>ⓞ</f> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
1 Chronicles 9-22 All these, who were chosen as gatekeepers at the thresholds, were 212. They were enrolled by genealogies in their villages. <f>ⓟ</f>David and Samuel <f>ⓠ</f>the seer established them in their office of trust.
1 Chronicles 9-23 So they and their sons were in charge of the gates of the house of the LORD, that is, the house of the tent, as guards.
1 Chronicles 9-24 The gatekeepers were on the four sides, east, west, north, and south.
1 Chronicles 9-25 And their kinsmen who were <f>ⓡ</f>in their villages were obligated to come <f>ⓢ</f>in every seven days, in turn, to be with these,
1 Chronicles 9-26 for the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted to be over <f>ⓣ</f>the chambers and the treasures of the house of God.
1 Chronicles 9-27 And they lodged around the house of God, for on them lay the duty of watching, and <f>ⓤ</f>they had charge of opening it every morning.
1 Chronicles 9-28 <pb/>Some of them had charge of the utensils of service, for they were required to count them when they were brought in and taken out.

1 Chronicles 9-32 Also some of their kinsmen of the Kohathites had <f>ⓐ</f>charge of the showbread, to prepare it every Sabbath.
1 Chronicles 9-33 <pb/>Now these, the <f>ⓑ</f>singers, the heads of fathers' houses of the Levites, were in the chambers of the temple free from other service, for they were on duty day and night.
1 Chronicles 9-34 These were heads of fathers' houses of the Levites, according to their generations, leaders. These lived in Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 9-35 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> In Gibeon lived the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, and the name of his wife was Maacah,
1 Chronicles 9-36 and his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
1 Chronicles 9-37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth;
1 Chronicles 9-38 and Mikloth was the father of Shimeam; and these also lived opposite their kinsmen in Jerusalem, with their kinsmen.
1 Chronicles 9-39 <f>ⓓ</f> Ner fathered Kish, Kish fathered Saul, Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

1 Corinthians 15-1 <pb/>Now I would remind you, brothers, <f>[1]</f> of the gospel <f>ⓐ</f>I preached to you, which you received, <f>ⓑ</f>in which you stand,
1 Corinthians 15-2 and by which <f>ⓒ</f>you are being saved, if you <f>ⓓ</f>hold fast to the word I preached to you — <f>ⓔ</f>unless you believed in vain.
1 Corinthians 15-3 <pb/>For <f>ⓕ</f>I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died <f>ⓖ</f>for our sins <f>ⓗ</f>in accordance with the Scriptures,
1 Corinthians 15-4 that he was buried, that he was raised <f>ⓘ</f>on the third day <f>ⓙ</f>in accordance with the Scriptures,
1 Corinthians 15-5 and that <f>ⓚ</f>he appeared to Cephas, then <f>ⓛ</f>to the twelve.
1 Corinthians 15-6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
1 Corinthians 15-7 Then he appeared to <f>ⓜ</f>James, then <f>ⓝ</f>to all the apostles.
1 Corinthians 15-8 Last of all, as to one untimely born, <f>ⓞ</f>he appeared also to me.
1 Corinthians 15-9 For <f>ⓟ</f>I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because <f>ⓠ</f>I persecuted the church of God.
1 Corinthians 15-10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, <f>ⓡ</f>I worked harder than any of them, <f>ⓢ</f>though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.
1 Corinthians 15-11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
1 Corinthians 15-12 <pb/>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, <f>ⓣ</f>how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
1 Corinthians 15-13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, <f>ⓤ</f>then not even Christ has been raised.
1 Corinthians 15-14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.
1 Corinthians 15-15 We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that <f>ⓥ</f>he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.
1 Corinthians 15-16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.
1 Corinthians 15-17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and <f>ⓦ</f>you are still in your sins.
1 Corinthians 15-18 Then those also who <f>ⓧ</f>have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians 15-19 If in Christ we have hope <f>[2]</f> in this life only, <f>ⓨ</f>we are of all people most to be pitied.
1 Corinthians 15-20 <pb/>But in fact <f>ⓩ</f>Christ has been raised from the dead, <f>ⓐ</f>the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
1 Corinthians 15-21 For as <f>ⓑ</f>by a man came death, <f>ⓒ</f>by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.
1 Corinthians 15-22 For <f>ⓓ</f>as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
1 Corinthians 15-23 But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then <f>ⓔ</f>at his coming <f>ⓕ</f>those who belong to Christ.
1 Corinthians 15-24 Then comes the end, when he delivers <f>ⓖ</f>the kingdom to God the Father after destroying <f>ⓗ</f>every rule and every authority and power.
1 Corinthians 15-25 For he must reign <f>ⓘ</f>until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
1 Corinthians 15-26 The last enemy to be <f>ⓙ</f>destroyed is death.
1 Corinthians 15-27 For <f>ⓚ</f>“God <f>[3]</f> has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.
1 Corinthians 15-28 When <f>ⓛ</f>all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that <f>ⓜ</f>God may be all in all.
1 Corinthians 15-29 <pb/>Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?
1 Corinthians 15-30 Why are we <f>ⓝ</f>in danger every hour?
1 Corinthians 15-31 I protest, brothers, by <f>ⓞ</f>my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, <f>ⓟ</f>I die every day!
1 Corinthians 15-32 What do I gain if, humanly speaking, <f>ⓠ</f>I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, <f>ⓡ</f>“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”
1 Corinthians 15-33 <f>ⓢ</f> Do not be deceived: <f>ⓣ</f>“Bad company ruins good morals.” <f>[4]</f>
1 Corinthians 15-34 <f>ⓤ</f> Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For <f>ⓥ</f>some have no knowledge of God. <f>ⓦ</f>I say this to your shame.
1 Corinthians 15-35 <pb/>But someone will ask, <f>ⓧ</f>“How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?”
1 Corinthians 15-36 You foolish person! <f>ⓨ</f>What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
1 Corinthians 15-37 And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
1 Corinthians 15-38 But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.
1 Corinthians 15-39 For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
1 Corinthians 15-40 There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another.
1 Corinthians 15-41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
1 Corinthians 15-42 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable.
1 Corinthians 15-43 It is sown in dishonor; <f>ⓐ</f>it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
1 Corinthians 15-44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
1 Corinthians 15-45 Thus it is written, <f>ⓑ</f>“The first man Adam became a living being”; <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓒ</f>the last Adam became a <f>ⓓ</f>life-giving spirit.
1 Corinthians 15-46 But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual.
1 Corinthians 15-47 <f>ⓔ</f> The first man was from the earth, <f>ⓕ</f>a man of dust; <f>ⓖ</f>the second man is from heaven.
1 Corinthians 15-48 As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, <f>ⓗ</f>so also are those who are of heaven.
1 Corinthians 15-49 Just <f>ⓘ</f>as we have borne the image of the man of dust, <f>ⓙ</f>we shall <f>[6]</f> also bear the image of the man of heaven.
1 Corinthians 15-50 <pb/>I tell you this, brothers: <f>ⓚ</f>flesh and blood <f>ⓛ</f>cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
1 Corinthians 15-51 Behold! I tell you a mystery. <f>ⓜ</f>We shall not all sleep, <f>ⓝ</f>but we shall all be changed,
1 Corinthians 15-52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For <f>ⓞ</f>the trumpet will sound, and <f>ⓟ</f>the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.
1 Corinthians 15-53 For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and <f>ⓠ</f>this mortal body must put on immortality.
1 Corinthians 15-54 When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f>“Death is swallowed up in victory.”</t>
1 Corinthians 15-55 <t><f>ⓢ</f> “O death, where is your victory? </t><t>O death, where is your sting?” </t>
1 Corinthians 15-56 <pb/>The sting of death is sin, and <f>ⓣ</f>the power of sin is the law.
1 Corinthians 15-57 But thanks be to God, <f>ⓤ</f>who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians 15-58 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in <f>ⓦ</f>the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord <f>ⓧ</f>your labor is not in vain.
