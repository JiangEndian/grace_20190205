2 Samuel 21-1 <pb/>Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year. And David <f>ⓐ</f>sought the face of the LORD. And the LORD said, “There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.”
2 Samuel 21-2 So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the people of Israel but <f>ⓑ</f>of the remnant of the Amorites. Although the people of Israel had sworn to spare them, Saul had sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel 21-3 And David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And how shall I make atonement, that you may bless <f>ⓒ</f>the heritage of the LORD?”
2 Samuel 21-4 The Gibeonites said to him, “It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” And he said, “What do you say that I shall do for you?”
2 Samuel 21-5 They said to the king, “The man who consumed us and planned to destroy us, so that we should have no place in all the territory of Israel,
2 Samuel 21-6 let seven of his sons be given to us, so that we may hang them before the LORD at <f>ⓓ</f>Gibeah of Saul, <f>ⓔ</f>the chosen of the LORD.” And the king said, “I will give them.”
2 Samuel 21-7 <pb/>But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of <f>ⓕ</f>the oath of the LORD that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
2 Samuel 21-8 The king took the two sons of <f>ⓖ</f>Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab <f>[1]</f> the daughter of Saul, whom <f>ⓗ</f>she bore to <f>ⓘ</f>Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;
2 Samuel 21-9 and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before the LORD, and the seven of them perished together. They were put to death in the first days of harvest, <f>ⓙ</f>at the beginning of barley harvest.
2 Samuel 21-10 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until rain fell upon them from the heavens. And she did not allow the birds of the air to come upon them by day, or the beasts of the field by night.
2 Samuel 21-11 When David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done,
2 Samuel 21-12 David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, <f>ⓛ</f>who had stolen them from the public square of <f>ⓜ</f>Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, on the day the Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa.
2 Samuel 21-13 And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
2 Samuel 21-14 And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin in <f>ⓝ</f>Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. And they did all that the king commanded. And after that <f>ⓞ</f>God responded to the plea for the land.
2 Samuel 21-15 <pb/>There was war again between the Philistines and Israel, and David went down together with his servants, and they fought against the Philistines. And David grew weary.
2 Samuel 21-16 And Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants <f>ⓟ</f>of the giants, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels <f>[2]</f> of bronze, and who was armed with a new sword, thought to kill David.
2 Samuel 21-17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, <f>ⓠ</f>“You shall no longer go out with us to battle, lest you quench <f>ⓡ</f>the lamp of Israel.”
2 Samuel 21-18 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> After this there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then <f>ⓣ</f>Sibbecai <f>ⓤ</f>the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was one of the descendants <f>ⓥ</f>of the giants.
2 Samuel 21-19 And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob, and <f>ⓦ</f>Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, struck down Goliath the Gittite, <f>ⓧ</f>the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. <f>[3]</f>
2 Samuel 21-20 And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended <f>ⓨ</f>from the giants.
2 Samuel 21-21 And when <f>ⓩ</f>he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down.
2 Samuel 21-22 These four were descended <f>ⓐ</f>from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.

John 21-1 <pb/>After this Jesus <f>ⓐ</f>revealed himself <f>ⓑ</f>again to the disciples by <f>ⓒ</f>the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way.
John 21-2 Simon Peter, <f>ⓓ</f>Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of <f>ⓔ</f>Cana in Galilee, <f>ⓕ</f>the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
John 21-3 Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will go with you.” They went out and got into the boat, but <f>ⓖ</f>that night they caught nothing.
John 21-4 <pb/>Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples <f>ⓗ</f>did not know that it was Jesus.
John 21-5 <f>ⓘ</f> Jesus said to them, <J>“Children, do you have any fish?”</J> They answered him, “No.”
John 21-6 <f>ⓙ</f> He said to them, <J>“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”</J> So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish.
John 21-7 That disciple <f>ⓚ</f>whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, <f>ⓛ</f>he put on his outer garment, for he was <f>ⓜ</f>stripped for work, and <f>ⓝ</f>threw himself into the sea.
John 21-8 The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards <f>[1]</f> off.
John 21-9 <pb/>When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread.
John 21-10 Jesus said to them, <J>“Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”</J>
John 21-11 So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn.
John 21-12 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓞ</f>“Come and <f>ⓟ</f>have breakfast.”</J> Now <f>ⓠ</f>none of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.
John 21-13 Jesus came and <f>ⓡ</f>took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish.
John 21-14 <f>ⓢ</f> This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.
John 21-15 <pb/>When they had <f>ⓣ</f>finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“Simon, <f>ⓥ</f>son of John, <f>ⓦ</f>do you love me more than these?”</J> He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, <J>“Feed <f>ⓧ</f>my lambs.”</J>
John 21-16 He said to him a second time, <J>“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</J> He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, <J> <f>ⓨ</f>“Tend <f>ⓩ</f>my sheep.”</J>
John 21-17 He said to him the third time, <J>“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</J> Peter was grieved because he said to him <f>ⓐ</f>the third time, <J>“Do you love me?”</J> and he said to him, “Lord, <f>ⓑ</f>you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, <J>“Feed <f>ⓒ</f>my sheep.</J>
John 21-18 <J><f>ⓓ</f> Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, <f>ⓔ</f>you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.”</J>
John 21-19 (This he said to show <f>ⓕ</f>by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>“Follow me.”</J>
John 21-20 <pb/>Peter turned and saw <f>ⓗ</f>the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, <f>ⓘ</f>the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, “Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?”
John 21-21 When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”
John 21-22 Jesus said to him, <J>“If it is my will that he remain <f>ⓙ</f>until <f>ⓚ</f>I come, what is that to you? <f>ⓛ</f>You follow me!”</J>
John 21-23 So the saying spread abroad among <f>ⓜ</f>the brothers <f>[2]</f> that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, <J>“If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?”</J>
John 21-24 <pb/>This is the disciple <f>ⓝ</f>who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and <f>ⓞ</f>we know <f>ⓟ</f>that his testimony is true.
John 21-25 <pb/>Now <f>ⓠ</f>there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that <f>ⓡ</f>the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
