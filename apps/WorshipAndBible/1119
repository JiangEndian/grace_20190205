2 Samuel 1-1 <pb/>After the death of Saul, when David had returned <f>ⓐ</f>from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag.
2 Samuel 1-2 And on the third day, behold, <f>ⓑ</f>a man came from Saul's camp, <f>ⓒ</f>with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, <f>ⓓ</f>he fell to the ground and paid homage.
2 Samuel 1-3 David said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”
2 Samuel 1-4 And David said to him, <f>ⓔ</f>“How did it go? Tell me.” And he answered, “The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”
2 Samuel 1-5 Then David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
2 Samuel 1-6 And the young man who told him said, <f>ⓕ</f>“By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.
2 Samuel 1-7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’
2 Samuel 1-8 And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’
2 Samuel 1-9 And he said to me, <f>ⓖ</f>‘Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’
2 Samuel 1-10 So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. <f>ⓗ</f>And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”
2 Samuel 1-11 <pb/>Then David took hold of his clothes and <f>ⓘ</f>tore them, and so did all the men who were with him.
2 Samuel 1-12 And they mourned and wept <f>ⓙ</f>and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
2 Samuel 1-13 And David said to the young man who told him, “Where do you come from?” And he answered, “I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.”
2 Samuel 1-14 David said to him, “How is it you were not <f>ⓚ</f>afraid to put out your hand to destroy <f>ⓛ</f>the LORD's anointed?”
2 Samuel 1-15 Then <f>ⓜ</f>David called one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him.” And he struck him down so that he died.
2 Samuel 1-16 And David said to him, <f>ⓝ</f>“Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed <f>ⓞ</f>the LORD's anointed.’”
2 Samuel 1-17 <pb/>And David <f>ⓟ</f>lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son,
2 Samuel 1-18 and he said it <f>[1]</f> should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in <f>ⓠ</f>the Book of Jashar. <f>[2]</f> He said:
2 Samuel 1-19 <pb/><t>“Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places! </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>How the mighty have fallen!</t>
2 Samuel 1-20 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Tell it not in Gath, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, </t><t>lest the daughters of <f>ⓥ</f>the uncircumcised exult. </t>
2 Samuel 1-21 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> “You mountains of Gilboa, </t><t>let there be no dew or rain upon you, </t><t>nor fields of offerings! <f>[3]</f> </t><t>For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, </t><t>the shield of Saul, not <f>ⓧ</f>anointed with oil. </t>
2 Samuel 1-22 <pb/><t>“From the blood of the slain, </t><t>from the fat of the mighty, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>the bow of Jonathan turned not back, </t><t>and the sword of Saul returned not empty. </t>
2 Samuel 1-23 <pb/><t>“Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! </t><t>In life and in death they were not divided; </t><t>they were <f>ⓩ</f>swifter than eagles; </t><t>they were <f>ⓐ</f>stronger than lions. </t>
2 Samuel 1-24 <pb/><t>“You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, </t><t>who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>who put ornaments of gold on your apparel. </t>
2 Samuel 1-25 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> “How the mighty have fallen </t><t>in the midst of the battle! </t> <pb/><t>“Jonathan lies slain on your high places.</t>
2 Samuel 1-26 <t>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; </t><t>very pleasant have you been to me; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>your love to me was extraordinary, </t><t>surpassing the love of women. </t>
2 Samuel 1-27 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “How the mighty have fallen, </t><t>and the weapons of war perished!” </t>
Proverbs 5-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> My son, be attentive to my wisdom; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>incline your ear to my understanding,</t>
Proverbs 5-2 <t>that you may keep <f>ⓒ</f>discretion, </t><t>and your lips may <f>ⓓ</f>guard knowledge.</t>

John 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the beginning was <f>ⓑ</f>the Word, and <f>ⓒ</f>the Word was with God, and <f>ⓓ</f>the Word was God.
John 1-2 He was in the beginning with God.
John 1-3 <f>ⓔ</f> All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
John 1-4 <f>ⓕ</f> In him was life, <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>the life was the light of men.
John 1-5 <f>ⓗ</f> The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
John 1-6 <pb/>There was a man <f>ⓘ</f>sent from God, whose name was <f>ⓙ</f>John.
John 1-7 He came as a <f>ⓚ</f>witness, to bear witness about the light, <f>ⓛ</f>that all might believe through him.
John 1-8 <f>ⓜ</f> He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.
John 1-9 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
John 1-10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet <f>ⓞ</f>the world did not know him.
John 1-11 He came to <f>ⓟ</f>his own, <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓠ</f>his own people <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓡ</f>did not receive him.
John 1-12 But to all who did receive him, <f>ⓢ</f>who believed in his name, <f>ⓣ</f>he gave the right <f>ⓤ</f>to become <f>ⓥ</f>children of God,
John 1-13 who <f>ⓦ</f>were born, <f>ⓧ</f>not of blood <f>ⓨ</f>nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
John 1-14 <pb/>And <f>ⓩ</f>the Word <f>ⓐ</f>became flesh and <f>ⓑ</f>dwelt among us, <f>ⓒ</f>and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son <f>[4]</f> from the Father, full of <f>ⓓ</f>grace and <f>ⓔ</f>truth.
John 1-15 (<f>ⓕ</f>John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, <f>ⓖ</f>‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)
John 1-16 For from <f>ⓗ</f>his fullness we have all received, <f>ⓘ</f>grace upon grace. <f>[5]</f>
John 1-17 For <f>ⓙ</f>the law was given through Moses; <f>ⓚ</f>grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
John 1-18 <f>ⓛ</f> No one has ever seen God; <f>ⓜ</f>the only God, <f>[6]</f> who is at the Father's side, <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓝ</f>he has made him known.
John 1-19 <pb/>And this is the <f>ⓞ</f>testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, <f>ⓟ</f>“Who are you?”
John 1-20 <f>ⓠ</f> He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”
John 1-21 And they asked him, “What then? <f>ⓡ</f>Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you <f>ⓢ</f>the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”
John 1-22 So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
John 1-23 He said, “I am <f>ⓣ</f>the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight <f>[8]</f> the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
John 1-24 <pb/>(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)
John 1-25 They asked him, <f>ⓤ</f>“Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
John 1-26 John answered them, <f>ⓥ</f>“I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know,
John 1-27 even <f>ⓦ</f>he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”
John 1-28 These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John 1-29 <pb/>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, <f>ⓧ</f>the Lamb of God, who <f>ⓨ</f>takes away the sin <f>ⓩ</f>of the world!
John 1-30 This is he of whom I said, <f>ⓐ</f>‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’
John 1-31 I myself did not know him, but <f>ⓑ</f>for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”
John 1-32 And John <f>ⓒ</f>bore witness: <f>ⓓ</f>“I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and <f>ⓔ</f>it remained on him.
John 1-33 I myself did not know him, but <f>ⓕ</f>he who sent me to baptize <f>ⓖ</f>with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, <f>ⓗ</f>this is he who baptizes <f>ⓘ</f>with the Holy Spirit.’
John 1-34 And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son <f>[9]</f> of God.”
John 1-35 <pb/>The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples,
John 1-36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, <f>ⓙ</f>the Lamb of God!”
John 1-37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.
John 1-38 Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>“What are you seeking?”</J> And they said to him, <f>ⓛ</f>“Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”
John 1-39 He said to them, <J>“Come and you will see.”</J> So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. <f>[10]</f>
John 1-40 <f>ⓜ</f> One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus <f>[11]</f> was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
John 1-41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found <f>ⓝ</f>the Messiah” (which means Christ).
John 1-42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, <J>“You are Simon the son of <f>ⓞ</f>John. You shall be called <f>ⓟ</f>Cephas”</J> (which means <f>ⓠ</f>Peter <f>[12]</f>).
John 1-43 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> The next day Jesus decided <f>ⓢ</f>to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, <J>“Follow me.”</J>
John 1-44 Now <f>ⓣ</f>Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
John 1-45 Philip found <f>ⓤ</f>Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom <f>ⓥ</f>Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus <f>ⓦ</f>of Nazareth, <f>ⓧ</f>the son of Joseph.”
John 1-46 Nathanael said to him, <f>ⓨ</f>“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”
John 1-47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, <J>“Behold, <f>ⓩ</f>an Israelite indeed, <f>ⓐ</f>in whom there is no deceit!”</J>
John 1-48 Nathanael said to him, “How <f>ⓑ</f>do you know me?” Jesus answered him, <J>“Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</J>
John 1-49 Nathanael answered him, <f>ⓒ</f>“Rabbi, <f>ⓓ</f>you are the Son of God! You are the <f>ⓔ</f>King of Israel!”
John 1-50 Jesus answered him, <J>“Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”</J>
John 1-51 And he said to him, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>[13]</f> you will see <f>ⓕ</f>heaven opened, and <f>ⓖ</f>the angels of God ascending and descending on <f>ⓗ</f>the Son of Man.”</J>
