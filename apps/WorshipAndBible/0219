1 Chronicles 22-1 <pb/>Then David said, <f>ⓐ</f>“Here shall be the house of the LORD God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
1 Chronicles 22-2 <pb/>David commanded to gather together the <f>ⓑ</f>resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, and he <f>ⓒ</f>set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God.
1 Chronicles 22-3 David also provided great quantities of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, <f>ⓓ</f>as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing,
1 Chronicles 22-4 and cedar timbers without number, <f>ⓔ</f>for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David.
1 Chronicles 22-5 For David said, <f>ⓕ</f>“Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and glory throughout all lands. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.
1 Chronicles 22-6 <pb/>Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles 22-7 David said to Solomon, “My son, <f>ⓖ</f>I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.
1 Chronicles 22-8 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <f>ⓗ</f>‘You have shed much blood and have waged great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood before me on the earth.
1 Chronicles 22-9 Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. <f>ⓘ</f>I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies. <f>ⓙ</f>For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
1 Chronicles 22-10 <f>ⓚ</f> He shall build a house for my name. <f>ⓛ</f>He shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.’
1 Chronicles 22-11 <pb/>“Now, my son, <f>ⓜ</f>the LORD be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as he has spoken concerning you.
1 Chronicles 22-12 <f>ⓝ</f> Only, may the LORD grant you discretion and understanding, that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
1 Chronicles 22-13 <f>ⓞ</f> Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the rules that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. <f>ⓟ</f>Be strong and courageous. Fear not; do not be dismayed.
1 Chronicles 22-14 With great pains I have provided for the house of the LORD <f>ⓠ</f>100,000 talents <f>[1]</f> of gold, a million talents of silver, and <f>ⓡ</f>bronze and iron beyond weighing, for there is so much of it; timber and stone, too, I have provided. To these you must add.
1 Chronicles 22-15 You have an abundance of workmen: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of craftsmen without number, skilled in working
1 Chronicles 22-16 gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and work! <f>ⓢ</f>The LORD be with you!”
1 Chronicles 22-17 <pb/>David also commanded <f>ⓣ</f>all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
1 Chronicles 22-18 “Is not the LORD your God with you? And <f>ⓤ</f>has he not given you peace <f>[2]</f> on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and his people.
1 Chronicles 22-19 Now <f>ⓥ</f>set your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God. Arise and build the sanctuary of the LORD God, <f>ⓦ</f>so that the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built <f>ⓧ</f>for the name of the LORD.”
Isaiah 46-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Bel bows down; Nebo stoops; </t><t>their idols are on beasts and livestock; </t><t>these things you carry are borne </t><t>as burdens on weary beasts.</t>
Isaiah 46-2 <t>They stoop; they bow down together; </t><t>they cannot save the burden, </t><t>but <f>ⓑ</f>themselves go into captivity. </t>
Isaiah 46-3 <pb/><t>“Listen to me, O house of Jacob, </t><t>all the remnant of the house of Israel, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>who have been borne by me from before your birth, </t><t>carried from the womb;</t>
Isaiah 46-4 <t><f>ⓓ</f> even to your old age I am he, </t><t>and to gray hairs I will carry you. </t><t>I have made, and I will bear; </t><t>I will carry and will save. </t>
Isaiah 46-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “To whom will you liken me and make me equal, </t><t>and compare me, that we may be alike?</t>
Isaiah 46-6 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Those who lavish gold from the purse, </t><t>and weigh out silver in the scales, </t><t>hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>then they fall down and worship!</t>
Isaiah 46-7 <t><f>ⓗ</f> They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it, </t><t>they set it in its place, and it stands there; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>it cannot move from its place. </t><t>If one cries to it, it does not answer </t><t>or save him from his trouble. </t>
Isaiah 46-8 <pb/><t>“Remember this and stand firm, </t><t>recall it to mind, <f>ⓙ</f>you transgressors,</t>
Isaiah 46-9 <t>remember the former things of old; </t><t>for I am God, and there is no other; </t><t>I am God, and there is none like me,</t>
Isaiah 46-10 <t><f>ⓚ</f> declaring the end from the beginning </t><t>and from ancient times things not yet done, </t><t>saying, <f>ⓛ</f>‘My counsel shall stand, </t><t>and I will accomplish all my purpose,’</t>
Isaiah 46-11 <t><f>ⓜ</f> calling a bird of prey from the east, </t><t>the man of my counsel from a far country. </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; </t><t>I have purposed, and I will do it. </t>
Isaiah 46-12 <pb/><t>“Listen to me, you stubborn of heart, </t><t>you who are far from righteousness:</t>

2 Corinthians 12-1 <pb/>I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and <f>ⓐ</f>revelations of the Lord.
2 Corinthians 12-2 I know a man <f>ⓑ</f>in Christ who fourteen years ago was <f>ⓒ</f>caught up to <f>ⓓ</f>the third heaven — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, <f>ⓔ</f>God knows.
2 Corinthians 12-3 And I know that this man was caught up into <f>ⓕ</f>paradise — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, <f>ⓖ</f>God knows —
2 Corinthians 12-4 and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.
2 Corinthians 12-5 On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, <f>ⓗ</f>except of my weaknesses —
2 Corinthians 12-6 though if I should wish to boast, <f>ⓘ</f>I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.
2 Corinthians 12-7 So <f>ⓙ</f>to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>a thorn was given me in the flesh, <f>ⓛ</f>a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.
2 Corinthians 12-8 <f>ⓜ</f> Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me.
2 Corinthians 12-9 But he said to me, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“My grace is sufficient for you, for <f>ⓞ</f>my power is made perfect in weakness.”</J> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that <f>ⓟ</f>the power of Christ may rest upon me.
2 Corinthians 12-10 <f>ⓠ</f> For the sake of Christ, then, <f>ⓡ</f>I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For <f>ⓢ</f>when I am weak, then I am strong.
2 Corinthians 12-11 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was <f>ⓤ</f>not at all inferior to these super-apostles, <f>ⓥ</f>even though I am nothing.
2 Corinthians 12-12 <f>ⓦ</f> The signs of a true apostle were performed among you <f>ⓧ</f>with utmost patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works.
2 Corinthians 12-13 For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that <f>ⓨ</f>I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!
2 Corinthians 12-14 <pb/>Here <f>ⓩ</f>for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for <f>ⓐ</f>I seek not what is yours but you. For <f>ⓑ</f>children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but <f>ⓒ</f>parents for their children.
2 Corinthians 12-15 <f>ⓓ</f> I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If <f>ⓔ</f>I love you more, am I to be loved less?
2 Corinthians 12-16 But granting that <f>ⓕ</f>I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by deceit.
2 Corinthians 12-17 Did I take advantage of you <f>ⓖ</f>through any of those whom I sent to you?
2 Corinthians 12-18 <f>ⓗ</f> I urged Titus to go, and sent <f>ⓘ</f>the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?
2 Corinthians 12-19 <pb/>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? It is <f>ⓙ</f>in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and <f>ⓚ</f>all for your upbuilding, beloved.
2 Corinthians 12-20 For I fear that perhaps <f>ⓛ</f>when I come I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish — that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder.
2 Corinthians 12-21 I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those <f>ⓜ</f>who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, <f>ⓝ</f>sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced.
