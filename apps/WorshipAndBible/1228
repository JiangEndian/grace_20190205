1 Kings 16-1 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to <f>ⓐ</f>Jehu the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Hanani against Baasha, saying,
1 Kings 16-2 “Since I <f>ⓒ</f>exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and <f>ⓓ</f>you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins,
1 Kings 16-3 behold, I will utterly <f>ⓔ</f>sweep away <f>ⓕ</f>Baasha and his house, and I will make your house <f>ⓖ</f>like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1 Kings 16-4 <f>ⓗ</f> Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat.”
1 Kings 16-5 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16-6 And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried at <f>ⓘ</f>Tirzah, and Elah his son reigned in his place.
1 Kings 16-7 Moreover, the word of the LORD came by the prophet <f>ⓙ</f>Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and also because <f>ⓚ</f>he destroyed it.
1 Kings 16-8 <pb/>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years.
1 Kings 16-9 But his servant <f>ⓛ</f>Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, <f>ⓜ</f>who was over the household in Tirzah,
1 Kings 16-10 Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.
1 Kings 16-11 <pb/>When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he struck down <f>ⓝ</f>all the house of Baasha. He <f>ⓞ</f>did not leave him a single male of his relatives or his friends.
1 Kings 16-12 Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, <f>ⓟ</f>according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by <f>ⓠ</f>Jehu the prophet,
1 Kings 16-13 for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel to sin, <f>ⓡ</f>provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols.
1 Kings 16-14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16-15 <pb/>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against <f>ⓢ</f>Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines,
1 Kings 16-16 and the troops who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king.” Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
1 Kings 16-17 So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
1 Kings 16-18 And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king's house and burned the king's house over him with fire and died,
1 Kings 16-19 because of his sins that he committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, <f>ⓣ</f>walking in the way of Jeroboam, and for his sin which he committed, making Israel to sin.
1 Kings 16-20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy that he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16-21 <pb/>Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts. Half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri.
1 Kings 16-22 But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri became king.
1 Kings 16-23 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah.
1 Kings 16-24 He bought the hill of <f>ⓤ</f>Samaria from Shemer for two talents <f>[1]</f> of silver, and he fortified the hill and called the name of the city that he built <f>ⓥ</f>Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.
1 Kings 16-25 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did more evil <f>ⓧ</f>than all who were before him.
1 Kings 16-26 For <f>ⓨ</f>he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in the sins that he made Israel to sin, <f>ⓩ</f>provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols.
1 Kings 16-27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16-28 And Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigned in his place.
1 Kings 16-29 <pb/>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
1 Kings 16-30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, <f>ⓐ</f>more than all who were before him.
1 Kings 16-31 And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓑ</f>he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the <f>ⓒ</f>Sidonians, <f>ⓓ</f>and went and served Baal and worshiped him.
1 Kings 16-32 He erected an altar for Baal in <f>ⓔ</f>the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria.
1 Kings 16-33 And Ahab made an <f>ⓕ</f>Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger <f>ⓖ</f>than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
1 Kings 16-34 <f>ⓗ</f> In his days Hiel of Bethel built <f>ⓘ</f>Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.

Acts 19-1 <pb/>And it happened that while <f>ⓐ</f>Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed <f>ⓑ</f>through the inland <f>[1]</f> country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
Acts 19-2 And he said to them, <f>ⓒ</f>“Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said, “No, <f>ⓓ</f>we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
Acts 19-3 And he said, <f>ⓔ</f>“Into what then were you baptized?” They said, “Into <f>ⓕ</f>John's baptism.”
Acts 19-4 And Paul said, <f>ⓖ</f>“John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people <f>ⓗ</f>to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.”
Acts 19-5 On hearing this, <f>ⓘ</f>they were baptized in <f>[2]</f> the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts 19-6 And <f>ⓙ</f>when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and <f>ⓚ</f>they began speaking in tongues and <f>ⓛ</f>prophesying.
Acts 19-7 There were about twelve men in all.
Acts 19-8 <pb/>And <f>ⓜ</f>he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them <f>ⓝ</f>about the kingdom of God.
Acts 19-9 <f>ⓞ</f> But when some became stubborn and <f>ⓟ</f>continued in unbelief, speaking evil of <f>ⓠ</f>the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. <f>[3]</f>
Acts 19-10 This continued for <f>ⓡ</f>two years, so that <f>ⓢ</f>all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
Acts 19-11 <pb/>And <f>ⓣ</f>God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,
Acts 19-12 <f>ⓤ</f> so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and <f>ⓥ</f>the evil spirits came out of them.
Acts 19-13 Then some of the itinerant Jewish <f>ⓦ</f>exorcists <f>ⓧ</f>undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, <f>ⓨ</f>“I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.”
Acts 19-14 Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.
Acts 19-15 But the evil spirit answered them, <f>ⓩ</f>“Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?”
Acts 19-16 And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all <f>[4]</f> of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
Acts 19-17 And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and <f>ⓐ</f>the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.
Acts 19-18 Also many of those who were now believers came, <f>ⓑ</f>confessing and divulging their practices.
Acts 19-19 And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts 19-20 So the word of the Lord <f>ⓒ</f>continued to increase and prevail mightily.
Acts 19-21 <pb/>Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit <f>ⓓ</f>to pass through <f>ⓔ</f>Macedonia and Achaia and <f>ⓕ</f>go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, <f>ⓖ</f>I must also see Rome.”
Acts 19-22 And having sent into Macedonia two of <f>ⓗ</f>his helpers, <f>ⓘ</f>Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia <f>ⓙ</f>for a while.
Acts 19-23 <pb/>About that time <f>ⓚ</f>there arose no little disturbance concerning <f>ⓛ</f>the Way.
Acts 19-24 For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, <f>ⓜ</f>brought no little business to the craftsmen.
Acts 19-25 <f>ⓝ</f> These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, “Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.
Acts 19-26 And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, <f>ⓞ</f>saying that <f>ⓟ</f>gods made with hands are not gods.
Acts 19-27 And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the <f>ⓠ</f>great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.”
Acts 19-28 <pb/>When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, <f>ⓡ</f>“Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
Acts 19-29 So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and <f>ⓢ</f>Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's <f>ⓣ</f>companions in travel.
Acts 19-30 But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him.
Acts 19-31 And even some of the Asiarchs, <f>[5]</f> who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater.
Acts 19-32 <f>ⓤ</f> Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
Acts 19-33 Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, <f>ⓥ</f>motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.
Acts 19-34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, <f>ⓦ</f>“Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
Acts 19-35 <pb/>And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from <f>ⓧ</f>the sky? <f>[6]</f>
Acts 19-36 Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.
Acts 19-37 For you have brought <f>ⓨ</f>these men here who are neither <f>ⓩ</f>sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess.
Acts 19-38 If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are <f>ⓐ</f>proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.
Acts 19-39 But if you seek anything further, <f>[7]</f> it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
Acts 19-40 For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.”
Acts 19-41 And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
