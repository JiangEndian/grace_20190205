10-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, <f>ⓑ</f>each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered <f>ⓒ</f>unauthorized <f>[1]</f> fire before the LORD, which he had not commanded them.
10-2 And fire <f>ⓓ</f>came out from before the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
10-3 Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Among <f>ⓔ</f>those who are near me <f>ⓕ</f>I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” <f>ⓖ</f>And Aaron held his peace.
10-4 <pb/>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of <f>ⓗ</f>Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp.”
10-5 So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
10-6 And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, <f>ⓘ</f>“Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and <f>ⓙ</f>wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the LORD has kindled.
10-7 <f>ⓚ</f> And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, <f>ⓛ</f>for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.
10-8 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,
10-9 <f>ⓜ</f> “Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
10-10 You are to <f>ⓝ</f>distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
10-11 and <f>ⓞ</f>you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the LORD has spoken to them by Moses.”
10-12 <pb/>Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: “Take the <f>ⓟ</f>grain offering that is left of the LORD's food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for <f>ⓠ</f>it is most holy.
10-13 You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due, from the LORD's food offerings, for <f>ⓡ</f>so I am commanded.
10-14 But the <f>ⓢ</f>breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons' due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel.
10-15 <f>ⓣ</f> The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the LORD, and it shall be yours and your sons' with you as a due forever, as the LORD has commanded.”
10-16 <pb/>Now Moses diligently inquired about <f>ⓤ</f>the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,
10-17 <f>ⓥ</f> “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since <f>ⓦ</f>it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
10-18 Behold, <f>ⓧ</f>its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, <f>ⓨ</f>as I commanded.”
10-19 And Aaron said to Moses, “Behold, <f>ⓩ</f>today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, <f>ⓐ</f>would the LORD have approved?”
10-20 And when Moses heard that, he approved.
29-1 <pb/>And Job again <f>ⓐ</f>took up his discourse, and said:
29-2 <pb/><t>“Oh, that I were as in the months of old, </t><t>as in the days when God watched over me,</t>
29-3 <t>when his <f>ⓑ</f>lamp shone upon my head, </t><t>and by his light I walked through darkness,</t>
29-4 <t>as I was in my prime, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>when the <f>ⓒ</f>friendship of God was upon my tent,</t>
29-5 <t>when the Almighty was yet with me, </t><t>when my <f>ⓓ</f>children were all around me,</t>
29-6 <t>when my steps were <f>ⓔ</f>washed with <f>ⓕ</f>butter, </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>the rock poured out for me streams of <f>ⓗ</f>oil!</t>
29-7 <t>When I went out to <f>ⓘ</f>the gate of the city, </t><t>when I prepared my seat in the square,</t>
29-8 <t>the young men saw me and withdrew, </t><t>and the aged rose and stood;</t>
29-9 <t>the princes refrained from talking </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>laid their hand on their mouth;</t>
29-10 <t>the voice of the nobles was hushed, </t><t>and their <f>ⓚ</f>tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.</t>
29-11 <t>When the ear heard, it called me blessed, </t><t>and when the eye saw, it approved,</t>
29-12 <t>because I <f>ⓛ</f>delivered the poor who cried for help, </t><t>and the fatherless who had none to help him.</t>
29-13 <t><f>ⓜ</f> The blessing of him who was <f>ⓝ</f>about to perish came upon me, </t><t>and I caused <f>ⓞ</f>the widow's heart to sing for joy.</t>
29-14 <t>I <f>ⓟ</f>put on righteousness, and it clothed me; </t><t>my justice was like a robe and <f>ⓠ</f>a turban.</t>
29-15 <t>I was <f>ⓡ</f>eyes to the blind </t><t>and feet to the lame.</t>
29-16 <t>I was a father to the needy, </t><t>and I searched out <f>ⓢ</f>the cause of him whom I did not know.</t>
29-17 <t>I <f>ⓣ</f>broke <f>ⓤ</f>the fangs of the unrighteous </t><t>and made him drop his prey from his teeth.</t>
29-18 <t><f>ⓥ</f> Then I thought, ‘I shall die in my <f>ⓦ</f>nest, </t><t>and I shall multiply my days as <f>ⓧ</f>the sand,</t>
29-19 <t>my <f>ⓨ</f>roots spread out to <f>ⓩ</f>the waters, </t><t>with the dew all night on my <f>ⓐ</f>branches,</t>
29-20 <t>my glory fresh with me, </t><t>and my <f>ⓑ</f>bow ever <f>ⓒ</f>new in my hand.’ </t>
29-21 <pb/><t>“Men listened to me and waited </t><t>and kept silence for my counsel.</t>
29-22 <t>After I spoke they did not speak again, </t><t>and my word <f>ⓓ</f>dropped upon them.</t>
29-23 <t>They waited for me as for the rain, </t><t>and they <f>ⓔ</f>opened their mouths as for the <f>ⓕ</f>spring rain.</t>
29-24 <t>I smiled on them when they had no confidence, </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>the light of my <f>ⓗ</f>face they did not cast down.</t>
29-25 <t>I chose their way and sat as chief, </t><t>and I lived like <f>ⓘ</f>a king among his troops, </t><t>like one who comforts mourners. </t>
28-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
28-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, say to <f>ⓑ</f>the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f>“Because your heart is proud, </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>you have said, ‘I am a god, </t><t>I sit in the seat of the gods, </t><t>in the heart of the seas,’ </t><t>yet <f>ⓔ</f>you are but a man, and no god, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>though you make your heart like the heart of a god — </t>
28-3 <t><f>ⓖ</f> you are indeed wiser <f>ⓗ</f>than <f>ⓘ</f>Daniel; </t><t>no secret is hidden from you;</t>
28-4 <t>by your wisdom and your understanding </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>you have made wealth for yourself, </t><t>and have gathered gold and silver </t><t>into your treasuries;</t>
28-5 <t>by your great wisdom in your trade </t><t>you have increased your wealth, </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>your heart has become proud in your wealth — </t>
28-6 <t>therefore thus says the Lord GOD: </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>Because you make your heart </t><t>like the heart of a god,</t>
28-7 <t>therefore, behold, I will bring <f>ⓜ</f>foreigners upon you, </t><t>the most ruthless of the nations; </t><t>and they shall draw their swords against <f>ⓝ</f>the beauty of your wisdom </t><t>and defile <f>ⓞ</f>your splendor.</t>
28-8 <t><f>ⓟ</f> They shall thrust you down into the pit, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and you shall die the death of the slain </t><t>in the heart of the seas.</t>
28-9 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’ </t><t>in the presence of those who kill you, </t><t>though <f>ⓢ</f>you are but a man, and no god, </t><t>in the hands of those who slay you?</t>
28-10 <t><f>ⓣ</f> You shall die the death of the uncircumcised </t><t>by the hand of foreigners; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.” </t>
28-11 <pb/>Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me:
28-12 <f>ⓥ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓦ</f>raise a lamentation over <f>ⓧ</f>the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD: <pb/><t>“You were the signet of perfection, <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>full of wisdom and <f>ⓩ</f>perfect in beauty.</t>
28-13 <t>You were in <f>ⓐ</f>Eden, the garden of God; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>every precious stone was your covering, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>sardius, topaz, and diamond, </t><t>beryl, onyx, and jasper, </t><t>sapphire, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>emerald, and carbuncle; </t><t>and crafted in gold were your settings </t><t>and your engravings. <f>[3]</f> </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>On the day that you were created </t><t>they were prepared.</t>
28-14 <t>You were an anointed <f>ⓕ</f>guardian cherub. </t><t>I placed you; <f>[4]</f> you were on <f>ⓖ</f>the holy mountain of God; </t><t>in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.</t>
28-15 <t>You were blameless in your ways </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>from the day you were created, </t><t>till unrighteousness was found in you.</t>
28-16 <t>In the abundance of <f>ⓘ</f>your trade </t><t>you were filled with violence in your midst, and you sinned; </t><t>so I cast you as a profane thing from <f>ⓙ</f>the mountain of God, </t><t>and I destroyed you, <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓚ</f>O guardian cherub, </t><t>from the midst of the stones of fire.</t>
28-17 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Your heart was proud because of <f>ⓜ</f>your beauty; </t><t>you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. </t><t>I cast you to the ground; </t><t>I exposed you before kings, </t><t>to feast their eyes on you.</t>
28-18 <t>By the multitude of your iniquities, </t><t>in the unrighteousness of your trade </t><t>you profaned your sanctuaries; </t><t>so <f>ⓝ</f>I brought fire out from your midst; </t><t>it consumed you, </t><t>and I turned you to ashes on the earth </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>in the sight of all who saw you.</t>
28-19 <t>All who know you among the peoples </t><t>are appalled at you; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>you have come to a dreadful end </t><t>and shall be no more forever.” </t>
28-20 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
28-21 <f>ⓠ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓡ</f>set your face toward <f>ⓢ</f>Sidon, and <f>ⓣ</f>prophesy against her

28-24 <pb/>“And for the house of Israel <f>ⓐ</f>there shall be no more a brier to prick or <f>ⓑ</f>a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors <f>ⓒ</f>who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.
