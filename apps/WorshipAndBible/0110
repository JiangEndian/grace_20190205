7-1 <pb/>But Elisha said, “Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the LORD, <f>ⓐ</f>Tomorrow about this time a seah <f>[1]</f> of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, <f>[2]</f> and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.”
7-2 Then <f>ⓑ</f>the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of God, <f>ⓒ</f>“If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?” But he said, “You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”
7-3 <pb/>Now there were four men who were lepers <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>at the entrance to the gate. And they said to one another, “Why are we sitting here until we die?
7-4 If we say, ‘Let us enter the city,’ the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die.”
7-5 So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. But when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there.
7-6 For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians <f>ⓔ</f>hear the sound of chariots and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, “Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us <f>ⓕ</f>the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us.”
7-7 <f>ⓖ</f> So they fled away in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.
7-8 And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and went and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent and carried off things from it and went and hid them.
7-9 <pb/>Then they said to one another, “We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come; let us go and tell the king's household.”
7-10 So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied and the donkeys tied and the tents as they were.”
7-11 Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king's household.
7-12 And the king rose in the night and said to his servants, “I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.’”
7-13 And one of his servants said, “Let some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel who have already perished. Let us send and see.”
7-14 So they took two horsemen, and the king sent them after the army of the Syrians, saying, “Go and see.”
7-15 So they went after them as far as the Jordan, and behold, all the way was littered with garments and equipment that the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.
7-16 <pb/>Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, <f>ⓗ</f>according to the word of the LORD.
7-17 Now the king had appointed <f>ⓘ</f>the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. And the people trampled him in the gate, so that he died, as the man of God had said <f>ⓙ</f>when the king came down to him.
7-18 For when the man of God had said to the king, “Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria,”
7-19 <f>ⓚ</f> the captain had answered the man of God, “If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?” And he had said, <f>ⓛ</f>“You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.”
7-20 And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate and he died.
6-1 <pb/>In the year that <f>ⓐ</f>King Uzziah died I <f>ⓑ</f>saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train <f>[1]</f> of his robe filled the temple.
6-2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had <f>ⓒ</f>six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
6-3 And one called to another and said: <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>the whole earth is full of his glory!” <f>[2]</f> </t>
6-4 <pb/>And <f>ⓕ</f>the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and <f>ⓖ</f>the house was filled with smoke.
6-5 And I said: “Woe is me! <f>ⓗ</f>For I am lost; <f>ⓘ</f>for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the <f>ⓙ</f>King, the LORD of hosts!”
6-6 <pb/>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
6-7 And he <f>ⓚ</f>touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”
6-8 <pb/>And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for <f>ⓛ</f>us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.”
6-9 And he said, “Go, and say to this people: <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“‘Keep on hearing, <f>[3]</f> but do not understand; </t><t>keep on seeing, <f>[4]</f> but do not perceive.’</t>
6-10 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Make the heart of this people <f>ⓞ</f>dull, <f>[5]</f> </t><t>and their ears heavy, </t><t>and blind their eyes; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>lest they see with their eyes, </t><t>and hear with their ears, </t><t>and understand with their hearts, </t><t>and turn and be healed.”</t>
6-11 <t>Then I said, <f>ⓠ</f>“How long, O Lord?” </t><t>And he said: </t><t>“Until <f>ⓡ</f>cities lie waste </t><t>without inhabitant, </t><t>and houses without people, </t><t>and the land is a desolate waste,</t>
6-12 <t>and the LORD removes people far away, </t><t>and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</t>
6-13 <t><f>ⓢ</f> And though a tenth remain in it, </t><t>it will be burned <f>[6]</f> again, </t><t>like a terebinth or an oak, </t><t>whose stump <f>ⓣ</f>remains </t><t>when it is felled.” </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>The holy seed <f>[7]</f> is its stump. </t>
4-1 <pb/>What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, <f>ⓐ</f>our forefather according to the flesh?
4-2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but <f>ⓑ</f>not before God.
4-3 For what does the Scripture say? <f>ⓒ</f>“Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”
4-4 Now <f>ⓓ</f>to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.
4-5 And to the one who does not work but <f>ⓔ</f>believes in <f>[1]</f> him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,
4-6 just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:
4-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f> “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, </t><t>and whose sins are covered;</t>
4-8 <t>blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not <f>ⓖ</f>count his sin.” </t>
4-9 <pb/>Is this blessing then only for <f>ⓗ</f>the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? <f>ⓘ</f>For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.
4-10 How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.
4-11 <f>ⓙ</f> He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was <f>ⓚ</f>to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,
4-12 and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
4-13 <pb/>For <f>ⓛ</f>the promise to Abraham and his offspring <f>ⓜ</f>that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.
4-14 <f>ⓝ</f> For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.
4-15 For <f>ⓞ</f>the law brings wrath, but <f>ⓟ</f>where there is no law <f>ⓠ</f>there is no transgression.
4-16 <pb/>That is why it depends on faith, <f>ⓡ</f>in order that the promise may rest on grace and <f>ⓢ</f>be guaranteed to all his offspring — not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, <f>ⓣ</f>who is the father of us all,
4-17 as it is written, <f>ⓤ</f>“I have made you the father of many nations” — in the presence of the God in whom he believed, <f>ⓥ</f>who gives life to the dead and calls into existence <f>ⓦ</f>the things that do not exist.
4-18 In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, <f>ⓧ</f>“So shall your offspring be.”
4-19 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was <f>ⓨ</f>as good as dead (<f>ⓩ</f>since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered <f>ⓐ</f>the barrenness <f>[2]</f> of Sarah's womb.
4-20 No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,
4-21 fully convinced that <f>ⓑ</f>God was able to do what he had promised.
4-22 That is why his faith was “counted to him as righteousness.”
4-23 But <f>ⓒ</f>the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake alone,
4-24 but for ours also. It will be counted to us <f>ⓓ</f>who believe in <f>ⓔ</f>him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,
4-25 <f>ⓕ</f> who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised <f>ⓖ</f>for our justification.
