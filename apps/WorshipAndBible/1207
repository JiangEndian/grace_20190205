2 Samuel 19-1 <pb/>It was told Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”
2 Samuel 19-2 So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people, for the people heard that day, “The king is grieving for his son.”
2 Samuel 19-3 And the people stole into the city that day as people steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle.
2 Samuel 19-4 The king <f>ⓐ</f>covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, <f>ⓑ</f>“O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!”
2 Samuel 19-5 Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “You have today covered with shame the faces of all your servants, who have this day saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters and the lives of your wives and your concubines,
2 Samuel 19-6 because you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you, for today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today, then you would be pleased.
2 Samuel 19-7 Now therefore arise, go out and speak <f>ⓒ</f>kindly to your servants, for I swear by the LORD, if you do not go, not a man will stay with you this night, and this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.”
2 Samuel 19-8 Then the king arose and took his <f>ⓓ</f>seat in the gate. And the people were all told, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” And all the people came before the king. <pb/><e>David Returns to Jerusalem</e> </pb> <pb/>Now Israel had <f>ⓔ</f>fled every man to his own home.
2 Samuel 19-9 And all the people were arguing throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, <f>ⓕ</f>“The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies and <f>ⓖ</f>saved us from the hand of the Philistines, and now <f>ⓗ</f>he has fled out of the land from Absalom.
2 Samuel 19-10 But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”
2 Samuel 19-11 <pb/>And King David sent this message to <f>ⓘ</f>Zadok and Abiathar the priests: “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house, when the word of all Israel has come to the king? <f>[1]</f>
2 Samuel 19-12 You are my brothers; <f>ⓙ</f>you are my bone and my flesh. Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’
2 Samuel 19-13 And say to Amasa, <f>ⓚ</f>‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? <f>ⓛ</f>God do so to me and more also, if you are not <f>ⓜ</f>commander of my army from now on in place of Joab.’”
2 Samuel 19-14 And he swayed the heart of all the men of Judah <f>ⓝ</f>as one man, so that they sent word to the king, “Return, both you and all your servants.”
2 Samuel 19-15 So the king came back to the Jordan, and Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and to bring the king over the Jordan.
2 Samuel 19-16 <pb/>And <f>ⓞ</f>Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim, hurried to come down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
2 Samuel 19-17 And with him were a thousand men from Benjamin. And <f>ⓟ</f>Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons and his twenty servants, rushed down to the Jordan before the king,
2 Samuel 19-18 and they crossed the ford to bring over the king's household and to do his pleasure. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was about to cross the Jordan,
2 Samuel 19-19 and said to the king, <f>ⓠ</f>“Let not my lord hold me guilty or remember how your servant <f>ⓡ</f>did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. Do not let the king take it to heart.
2 Samuel 19-20 For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come this day, the first <f>ⓢ</f>of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”
2 Samuel 19-21 Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because <f>ⓣ</f>he cursed the LORD's anointed?”
2 Samuel 19-22 But David said, <f>ⓤ</f>“What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be as an adversary to me? <f>ⓥ</f>Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day? For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?”
2 Samuel 19-23 <f>ⓦ</f> And the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king gave him his oath.
2 Samuel 19-24 <pb/>And <f>ⓧ</f>Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. He had neither taken care of his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came back in safety.
2 Samuel 19-25 And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, <f>ⓨ</f>“Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”
2 Samuel 19-26 He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me, for your servant said to him, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself, <f>[2]</f> that I may ride on it and go with the king.’ For <f>ⓩ</f>your servant is lame.
2 Samuel 19-27 <f>ⓐ</f> He has slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is <f>ⓑ</f>like the angel of God; do therefore what seems good to you.
2 Samuel 19-28 For all my father's house were but men doomed to death before my lord the king, but <f>ⓒ</f>you set your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right have I, then, to cry to the king?”
2 Samuel 19-29 And the king said to him, “Why speak any more of your affairs? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.”
2 Samuel 19-30 And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Oh, let him take it all, since my lord the king has come safely home.”
2 Samuel 19-31 <pb/>Now <f>ⓓ</f>Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim, and he went on with the king to the Jordan, to escort him over the Jordan.
2 Samuel 19-32 Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. <f>ⓔ</f>He had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
2 Samuel 19-33 And the king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem.”
2 Samuel 19-34 But Barzillai said to the king, <f>ⓕ</f>“How many years have I still to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
2 Samuel 19-35 I am this day <f>ⓖ</f>eighty years old. Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks? Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be <f>ⓗ</f>an added burden to my lord the king?
2 Samuel 19-36 Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
2 Samuel 19-37 Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother. But here is your servant <f>ⓘ</f>Chimham. Let him go over with my lord the king, and do for him whatever seems good to you.”
2 Samuel 19-38 And the king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you, and all that you desire of me I will do for you.”
2 Samuel 19-39 Then all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. And <f>ⓙ</f>the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own home.
2 Samuel 19-40 The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. All the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel, brought the king on his way.
2 Samuel 19-41 <pb/>Then all the men of Israel came to the king and said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away and <f>ⓚ</f>brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all David's men with him?”
2 Samuel 19-42 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is <f>ⓛ</f>our close relative. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king's expense? Or has he given us any gift?”
2 Samuel 19-43 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have <f>ⓜ</f>ten shares in the king, and in David also we have more than you. Why then did you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?” <f>ⓝ</f>But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

John 19-1 <pb/>Then Pilate took Jesus and <f>ⓐ</f>flogged him.
John 19-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe.
John 19-3 They came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him with their hands.
John 19-4 Pilate went out again and said to them, “See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that <f>ⓒ</f>I find no guilt in him.”
John 19-5 So Jesus came out, wearing <f>ⓓ</f>the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, <f>ⓔ</f>“Behold the man!”
John 19-6 When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, <f>ⓕ</f>“Take him yourselves and crucify him, for <f>ⓖ</f>I find no guilt in him.”
John 19-7 The Jews <f>[1]</f> answered him, “We have a law, and <f>ⓗ</f>according to that law he ought to die because <f>ⓘ</f>he has made himself the Son of God.”
John 19-8 When Pilate heard this statement, <f>ⓙ</f>he was even more afraid.
John 19-9 <f>ⓚ</f> He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, <f>ⓛ</f>“Where are you from?” But <f>ⓜ</f>Jesus gave him no answer.
John 19-10 So Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?”
John 19-11 Jesus answered him, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore <f>ⓞ</f>he who delivered me over to you <f>ⓟ</f>has the greater sin.”</J>
John 19-12 <pb/>From then on <f>ⓠ</f>Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. <f>ⓡ</f>Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.”
John 19-13 So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on <f>ⓢ</f>the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic <f>[2]</f> Gabbatha.
John 19-14 Now it was <f>ⓣ</f>the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. <f>[3]</f> He said to the Jews, <f>ⓤ</f>“Behold your King!”
John 19-15 They cried out, <f>ⓥ</f>“Away with him, away with him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”
John 19-16 <f>ⓦ</f> So he <f>ⓧ</f>delivered him over to them to be crucified. <pb/><e>The Crucifixion</e> </pb> <pb/>So they took Jesus,
John 19-17 and <f>ⓨ</f>he went out, <f>ⓩ</f>bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha.
John 19-18 <f>ⓐ</f> There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.
John 19-19 Pilate <f>ⓑ</f>also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”
John 19-20 Many of the Jews read this inscription, for <f>ⓒ</f>the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.
John 19-21 So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’”
John 19-22 Pilate answered, <f>ⓓ</f>“What I have written I have written.”
John 19-23 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. <f>[4]</f> But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom,
John 19-24 so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” <f>ⓕ</f>This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“They divided my garments among them, </t><t>and for my clothing they cast lots.” </t> <pb/>So the soldiers did these things,
John 19-25 <f>ⓗ</f> but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John 19-26 When Jesus saw his mother and <f>ⓘ</f>the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <J> <f>ⓙ</f>“Woman, behold, your son!”</J>
John 19-27 Then he said to the disciple, <J>“Behold, your mother!”</J> And from that hour the disciple took her to <f>ⓚ</f>his own home.
John 19-28 <pb/>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now <f>ⓛ</f>finished, said (<f>ⓜ</f>to fulfill the Scripture), <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“I thirst.”</J>
John 19-29 A jar full of sour wine stood there, <f>ⓞ</f>so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.
John 19-30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“It is finished,”</J> and he bowed his head and <f>ⓠ</f>gave up his spirit.
John 19-31 <pb/>Since it was <f>ⓡ</f>the day of Preparation, and <f>ⓢ</f>so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was <f>ⓣ</f>a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.
John 19-32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other <f>ⓤ</f>who had been crucified with him.
John 19-33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
John 19-34 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out <f>ⓥ</f>blood and water.
John 19-35 <f>ⓦ</f> He who saw it has borne witness — <f>ⓧ</f>his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth — <f>ⓨ</f>that you also may believe.
John 19-36 <f>ⓩ</f> For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: <f>ⓐ</f>“Not one of his bones <f>ⓑ</f>will be broken.”
John 19-37 And again another Scripture says, <f>ⓒ</f>“They will look on him whom they have pierced.”
John 19-38 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly <f>ⓔ</f>for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.
John 19-39 <f>ⓕ</f> Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus <f>[5]</f> by night, came <f>ⓖ</f>bringing a mixture of <f>ⓗ</f>myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds <f>[6]</f> in weight.
John 19-40 So they took the body of Jesus and <f>ⓘ</f>bound it in <f>ⓙ</f>linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
John 19-41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a <f>ⓚ</f>garden, and <f>ⓛ</f>in the garden a new tomb <f>ⓜ</f>in which no one had yet been laid.
John 19-42 So because of the Jewish <f>ⓝ</f>day of Preparation, <f>ⓞ</f>since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.
