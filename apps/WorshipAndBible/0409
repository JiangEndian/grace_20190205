44-1 <pb/>Then he commanded <f>ⓐ</f>the steward of his house, <f>ⓑ</f>“Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack,
44-2 and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph told him.
44-3 <pb/>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys.
44-4 They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his <f>ⓒ</f>steward, “Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? <f>[1]</f>
44-5 Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and <f>ⓓ</f>by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.’”
44-6 <pb/>When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.
44-7 They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!
44-8 Behold, <f>ⓔ</f>the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?
44-9 <f>ⓕ</f> Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be <f>ⓖ</f>my lord's servants.”
44-10 He said, “Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent.”
44-11 Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
44-12 And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
44-13 Then they <f>ⓗ</f>tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.
44-14 <pb/>When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there. They <f>ⓘ</f>fell before him to the ground.
44-15 Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me <f>ⓙ</f>can indeed practice divination?”
44-16 And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out <f>ⓚ</f>the guilt of your servants; behold, we are <f>ⓛ</f>my lord's servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.”
44-17 But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.”
44-18 <pb/>Then Judah went up to him and said, <f>ⓜ</f>“Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and <f>ⓝ</f>let not your anger burn against your servant, for <f>ⓞ</f>you are like Pharaoh himself.
44-19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’
44-20 And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, <f>ⓟ</f>and a young brother, <f>ⓠ</f>the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.’
44-21 Then you said to your servants, <f>ⓡ</f>‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’
44-22 We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, <f>ⓢ</f>his father would die.’
44-23 Then you said to your servants, <f>ⓣ</f>‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.’
44-24 <pb/>“When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
44-25 And when <f>ⓤ</f>our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food,’
44-26 we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.’
44-27 Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me <f>ⓥ</f>two sons.
44-28 One left me, and I said, <f>ⓦ</f>“Surely he has been torn to pieces,” and I have never seen him since.
44-29 If you <f>ⓧ</f>take this one also from me, <f>ⓨ</f>and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.’
44-30 <pb/>“Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy's life,
44-31 as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
44-32 For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, <f>ⓩ</f>‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.’
44-33 Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers.
44-34 For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father.”
6-1 <pb/>Then Darius the king made a decree, and <f>ⓐ</f>search was made in Babylonia, in the house of the archives where the documents were stored.
6-2 And in Ecbatana, the citadel that is <f>ⓑ</f>in the province of Media, a scroll was found on which this was written: “A record.
6-3 In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king issued a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be rebuilt, the place where sacrifices were offered, and let its foundations be retained. Its height shall be sixty cubits <f>[1]</f> and its breadth sixty cubits,
6-4 <f>ⓒ</f> with three layers of great stones and one layer of timber. Let the cost be paid from the royal treasury.
6-5 And also <f>ⓓ</f>let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought back to the temple that is in Jerusalem, each to its place. You shall put them in the house of God.”
6-6 <pb/>“Now therefore, <f>ⓔ</f>Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, <f>ⓕ</f>and your <f>[2]</f> associates the governors who are in the province Beyond the River, keep away.
6-7 Let the work on this house of God alone. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site.
6-8 Moreover, <f>ⓖ</f>I make a decree regarding what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the rebuilding of this house of God. The cost is to be paid to these men in full and without delay from the royal revenue, the tribute of the province from Beyond the River.
6-9 And whatever is needed — bulls, rams, or sheep for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, or oil, as the priests at Jerusalem require — let that be given to them day by day without fail,
6-10 that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven <f>ⓗ</f>and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
6-11 Also I make a decree that if anyone alters this edict, a beam shall be pulled out of his house, and he shall be impaled on it, and <f>ⓘ</f>his house shall be made a dunghill.
6-12 May the God <f>ⓙ</f>who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who shall put out a hand to alter this, or to destroy this house of God that is in Jerusalem. I Darius make a decree; let it be done with all diligence.”
6-13 <pb/>Then, according to the word sent by Darius the king, <f>ⓚ</f>Tattenai, the governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates did with all diligence what Darius the king had ordered.
6-14 <f>ⓛ</f> And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They finished their building by decree of the God of Israel and <f>ⓜ</f>by decree of Cyrus and <f>ⓝ</f>Darius and <f>ⓞ</f>Artaxerxes king of Persia;
6-15 and this house was finished on the third day of the <f>ⓟ</f>month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
6-16 <pb/>And the people of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles, celebrated the <f>ⓠ</f>dedication of this house of God with joy.
6-17 They offered at the dedication of this house of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel <f>ⓡ</f>12 male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
6-18 And they set the priests <f>ⓢ</f>in their divisions and the Levites <f>ⓣ</f>in their divisions, for the service of God at Jerusalem, <f>ⓤ</f>as it is written in the Book of Moses.
6-19 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> On the fourteenth day of the first month, the returned exiles kept the Passover.
6-20 <f>ⓦ</f> For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. <f>ⓧ</f>So they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves.
6-21 It was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile, and <f>ⓨ</f>also by every one who had joined them and separated himself <f>ⓩ</f>from the uncleanness of the peoples of the land to worship the LORD, the God of Israel.
6-22 And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread <f>ⓐ</f>seven days with joy, for the LORD had made them joyful <f>ⓑ</f>and had turned the heart of <f>ⓒ</f>the king of Assyria to them, so that he aided them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
29-1 <pb/>These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to <f>ⓐ</f>the surviving elders of the exiles, and to <f>ⓑ</f>the priests, <f>ⓒ</f>the prophets, and <f>ⓓ</f>all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
29-2 This was after <f>ⓔ</f>King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem.
29-3 The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of <f>ⓕ</f>Shaphan and Gemariah the son of <f>ⓖ</f>Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:
29-4 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
29-5 <f>ⓗ</f> Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
29-6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease.
29-7 But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and <f>ⓘ</f>pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.
29-8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: <f>ⓙ</f>Do not let your prophets and <f>ⓚ</f>your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream, <f>[1]</f>
29-9 for <f>ⓛ</f>it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; <f>ⓜ</f>I did not send them, declares the LORD.
29-10 <pb/>“For thus says the LORD: <f>ⓝ</f>When seventy years are completed for Babylon, <f>ⓞ</f>I will visit you, <f>ⓟ</f>and I will fulfill to you my promise <f>ⓠ</f>and bring you back to this place.
29-11 <f>ⓡ</f> For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare <f>[2]</f> and not for evil, <f>ⓢ</f>to give you a future and a hope.
29-12 <f>ⓣ</f> Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, <f>ⓤ</f>and I will hear you.
29-13 <f>ⓥ</f> You will seek me and find me, when you seek me <f>ⓦ</f>with all your heart.
29-14 I will be found by you, declares the LORD, <f>ⓧ</f>and I will restore your fortunes and <f>ⓨ</f>gather you from all the nations and all the places <f>ⓩ</f>where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.
29-15 <pb/>“Because you have said, ‘The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’
29-16 thus says the LORD concerning <f>ⓐ</f>the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile:
29-17 ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, behold, I am sending on them <f>ⓑ</f>sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like <f>ⓒ</f>vile figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten.
29-18 I will pursue them with <f>ⓓ</f>sword, famine, and pestilence, <f>ⓔ</f>and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, <f>ⓕ</f>to be a curse, a terror, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations <f>ⓖ</f>where I have driven them,
29-19 because they did not pay attention to my words, declares the LORD, <f>ⓗ</f>that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen, declares the LORD.’
29-20 Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles <f>ⓘ</f>whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
29-21 ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, <f>ⓙ</f>who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your eyes.
29-22 <f>ⓚ</f> Because of them <f>ⓛ</f>this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: “The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, <f>ⓜ</f>whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,”
29-23 because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, <f>ⓝ</f>they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and <f>ⓞ</f>they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them. <f>ⓟ</f>I am the one who knows, <f>ⓠ</f>and I am witness, declares the LORD.’”
29-24 <pb/>To <f>ⓡ</f>Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:
29-25 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to <f>ⓢ</f>Zephaniah the son of <f>ⓣ</f>Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
29-26 ‘The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have <f>ⓤ</f>charge in the house of the LORD <f>ⓥ</f>over every madman who prophesies, to put him in <f>ⓦ</f>the stocks and neck irons.
29-27 Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah <f>ⓧ</f>of Anathoth who is prophesying to you?
29-28 For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, “Your exile will be long; <f>ⓨ</f>build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce.”’”
29-29 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
29-30 <f>ⓐ</f> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
29-31 “Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD concerning <f>ⓑ</f>Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because <f>ⓒ</f>Shemaiah had prophesied to you <f>ⓓ</f>when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie,
29-32 therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish <f>ⓔ</f>Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants. He shall not have anyone living among this people, <f>ⓕ</f>and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>for he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.’”
7-1 <pb/>For this <f>ⓐ</f>Melchizedek, king of <f>ⓑ</f>Salem, priest of <f>ⓒ</f>the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
7-2 and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.
7-3 He is without father or mother <f>ⓓ</f>or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.
7-4 <pb/>See how great this man was to whom Abraham <f>ⓔ</f>the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils!
7-5 And <f>ⓕ</f>those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, <f>[1]</f> though these also are descended from Abraham.
7-6 But this man <f>ⓖ</f>who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed <f>ⓗ</f>him who had the promises.
7-7 It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.
7-8 In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one <f>ⓘ</f>of whom it is testified that <f>ⓙ</f>he lives.
7-9 One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,
7-10 for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.
7-11 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?
7-12 For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.
7-13 For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
7-14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended <f>ⓛ</f>from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
7-15 <pb/>This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,
7-16 who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life.
7-17 For it is witnessed of him, <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f>“You are a priest forever, </t><t>after the order of Melchizedek.” </t>
7-18 <pb/>For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside <f>ⓝ</f>because of its weakness and uselessness
7-19 (for <f>ⓞ</f>the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, <f>ⓟ</f>a better hope is introduced, through which <f>ⓠ</f>we draw near to God.
7-20 <pb/>And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath,
7-21 but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him: <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f>“The Lord has sworn </t><t>and will not change his mind, </t><t>‘You are a priest forever.’” </t>
7-22 <pb/>This makes Jesus the guarantor of <f>ⓢ</f>a better covenant.
7-23 <pb/>The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,
7-24 but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues <f>ⓣ</f>forever.
7-25 Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>those who draw near to God <f>ⓥ</f>through him, since he always lives <f>ⓦ</f>to make intercession for them.
7-26 <pb/>For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, <f>ⓧ</f>holy, innocent, unstained, <f>ⓨ</f>separated from sinners, and <f>ⓩ</f>exalted above the heavens.
7-27 He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, <f>ⓐ</f>first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this <f>ⓑ</f>once for all when he offered up himself.
7-28 For the law appoints men <f>ⓒ</f>in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made <f>ⓓ</f>perfect forever.
