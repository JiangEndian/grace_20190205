27-1 <pb/>“You shall make the <f>ⓐ</f>altar of acacia wood, five cubits <f>[1]</f> long and five cubits broad. The altar shall be square, and its height shall be three cubits.
27-2 And you shall make <f>ⓑ</f>horns for it on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it, and <f>ⓒ</f>you shall overlay it with bronze.
27-3 You shall make pots for it to receive its ashes, and shovels and basins and <f>ⓓ</f>forks and fire pans. You shall make all its utensils of bronze.
27-4 You shall also make for it a grating, a network of bronze, and on the net you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners.
27-5 And you shall set it under the ledge of the altar so that the net extends halfway down the altar.
27-6 And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze.
27-7 And the poles shall be put through the rings, so that the poles are on the two sides of the altar when it is carried.
27-8 You shall make it hollow, with boards. <f>ⓔ</f>As it has been shown you on the mountain, so shall it be made.
27-9 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> “You shall make the court of the tabernacle. On the south side the court shall have hangings of fine twined linen a hundred cubits long for one side.
27-10 Its twenty pillars and their twenty bases shall be of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver.
27-11 And likewise for its length on the north side there shall be hangings a hundred cubits long, its pillars twenty and their bases twenty, of bronze, but the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver.
27-12 And for the breadth of the court on the west side there shall be hangings for fifty cubits, with ten pillars and ten bases.

27-21 <f>ⓘ</f> In the tent of meeting, <f>ⓙ</f>outside the veil that is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall tend it from evening to morning before the LORD. It shall be a statute forever to be observed throughout their generations by the people of Israel.
6-1 <pb/>Then Job answered and said:
6-2 <pb/><t>“Oh that my vexation were weighed, </t><t>and all my calamity laid in the balances!</t>
6-3 <t>For then it would be heavier than <f>ⓐ</f>the sand of the sea; </t><t>therefore my words have been rash.</t>
6-4 <t>For <f>ⓑ</f>the arrows of the Almighty are in me; </t><t>my spirit drinks their poison; </t><t>the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</t>
6-5 <t>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, </t><t>or the ox low over his fodder?</t>
6-6 <t>Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, </t><t>or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow? <f>[1]</f></t>
6-7 <t>My appetite refuses to touch them; </t><t>they are as food that is loathsome to me. <f>[2]</f> </t>
6-8 <pb/><t>“Oh that I might have my request, </t><t>and that God would fulfill my hope,</t>
6-9 <t>that it would <f>ⓒ</f>please God to crush me, </t><t>that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</t>
6-10 <t>This would be my comfort; </t><t>I would even exult <f>[3]</f> in pain <f>ⓓ</f>unsparing, </t><t>for I have not denied the words of <f>ⓔ</f>the Holy One.</t>
6-11 <t>What is my strength, that I should wait? </t><t>And what is my end, that I should be patient?</t>
6-12 <t>Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?</t>
6-13 <t>Have I any help in me, </t><t>when resource is driven from me? </t>
6-14 <pb/><t>“He who <f>ⓕ</f>withholds <f>[4]</f> kindness from a <f>ⓖ</f>friend </t><t>forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</t>
6-15 <t>My <f>ⓗ</f>brothers are <f>ⓘ</f>treacherous as a torrent-bed, </t><t>as torrential <f>ⓙ</f>streams that pass away,</t>
6-16 <t>which are dark with ice, </t><t>and where the snow hides itself.</t>
6-17 <t>When they melt, they disappear; </t><t>when it is hot, they vanish from their place.</t>
6-18 <t>The caravans turn aside from their course; </t><t>they go up into <f>ⓚ</f>the waste and perish.</t>
6-19 <t>The caravans of <f>ⓛ</f>Tema look, </t><t>the travelers of <f>ⓜ</f>Sheba hope.</t>
6-20 <t>They are <f>ⓝ</f>ashamed because they were confident; </t><t>they come there and are <f>ⓞ</f>disappointed.</t>
6-21 <t>For you have now become nothing; </t><t>you see my calamity and are afraid.</t>
6-22 <t>Have I said, ‘Make me a gift’? </t><t>Or, ‘From your wealth offer a bribe for me’?</t>
6-23 <t>Or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary's hand’? </t><t>Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of <f>ⓟ</f>the ruthless’? </t>
6-24 <pb/><t>“Teach me, and I will be silent; </t><t>make me understand how I have gone astray.</t>
6-25 <t>How forceful are upright words! </t><t>But what does reproof from you reprove?</t>
6-26 <t>Do you think that you can reprove words, </t><t>when the speech of a despairing man is <f>ⓠ</f>wind?</t>
6-27 <t>You would even <f>ⓡ</f>cast lots over the fatherless, </t><t>and bargain over your friend. </t>
6-28 <pb/><t>“But now, be pleased to look at me, </t><t>for I will not lie to your face.</t>
6-29 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Please turn; let no injustice be done. </t><t>Turn now; my vindication is at stake.</t>
6-30 <t>Is there any injustice on my tongue? </t><t>Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity? </t>
5-1 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓐ</f>O son of man, take a <f>ⓑ</f>sharp sword. Use it as <f>ⓒ</f>a barber's razor and <f>ⓓ</f>pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair.
5-2 <f>ⓔ</f> A third part you shall burn in the fire <f>ⓕ</f>in the midst of the city, <f>ⓖ</f>when the days of the siege are completed.

5-3 <f>ⓙ</f> And you shall take from these a small number and bind them in the skirts of your robe.
5-4 <f>ⓚ</f> And of these again you shall take some and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.
5-5 <pb/>“Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓛ</f>This is Jerusalem. I have set her <f>ⓜ</f>in the center of the nations, with countries all around her.
5-6 And she has rebelled against my rules by doing wickedness <f>ⓝ</f>more than the nations, and against my statutes more than <f>ⓞ</f>the countries all around her; for they have rejected my rules and have not walked in my statutes.
5-7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you are <f>ⓟ</f>more turbulent than the nations that are all around you, <f>ⓠ</f>and have not walked in my statutes or obeyed my rules, <f>ⓡ</f>and have not <f>[1]</f> even acted according to the rules of the nations that are all around you,
5-8 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, <f>ⓢ</f>am against you. <f>ⓣ</f>And I will execute judgments <f>[2]</f> in your midst <f>ⓤ</f>in the sight of the nations.
5-9 And because of all your abominations I will do with you <f>ⓥ</f>what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again.
5-10 Therefore <f>ⓦ</f>fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers. <f>ⓧ</f>And I will execute judgments on you, <f>ⓨ</f>and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds.
5-11 Therefore, <f>ⓩ</f>as I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely, <f>ⓐ</f>because you have defiled my sanctuary <f>ⓑ</f>with all your detestable things and with all your <f>ⓒ</f>abominations, <f>ⓓ</f>therefore I will withdraw. <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>My eye will not spare, and I will have no pity.
5-12 <f>ⓕ</f> A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in your midst; <f>ⓖ</f>a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; <f>ⓗ</f>and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them.
5-13 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> “Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself. And they shall know that <f>ⓙ</f>I am the LORD — that I have spoken in my jealousy — <f>ⓚ</f>when I spend my fury upon them.
5-14 Moreover, I will make you <f>ⓛ</f>a desolation and <f>ⓜ</f>an object of reproach among <f>ⓝ</f>the nations all around you and in the sight of all who pass by.
5-15 You shall be <f>[4]</f> a reproach and a taunt, a warning <f>ⓞ</f>and a horror, to <f>ⓟ</f>the nations all around you, <f>ⓠ</f>when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and <f>ⓡ</f>with furious rebukes — I am the LORD; I have spoken —
5-16 when I send against you <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓢ</f>the deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon <f>ⓣ</f>you and break your supply <f>[6]</f> of bread.
5-17 I will send famine and <f>ⓤ</f>wild beasts against you, <f>ⓥ</f>and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and <f>ⓦ</f>blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the LORD; I have spoken.”
6-1 <pb/>Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of <f>ⓐ</f>the seven seals, and I heard <f>ⓑ</f>one of the four living creatures say <f>ⓒ</f>with a voice like thunder, <f>ⓓ</f>“Come!”
6-2 And I looked, and behold, <f>ⓔ</f>a white horse! And <f>ⓕ</f>its rider had a bow, and <f>ⓖ</f>a crown was given to him, and he came out <f>ⓗ</f>conquering, and to conquer.
6-3 <pb/>When he opened the second seal, I heard <f>ⓘ</f>the second living creature say, “Come!”
6-4 And out came another horse, <f>ⓙ</f>bright red. Its rider was permitted <f>ⓚ</f>to take peace from the earth, so that people should slay one another, and he was given a great sword.
6-5 <pb/>When he opened the third seal, I heard the <f>ⓛ</f>third living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and behold, <f>ⓜ</f>a black horse! And its rider had a pair of scales in his hand.
6-6 And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“A quart <f>[1]</f> of wheat for a denarius, <f>[2]</f> and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and <f>ⓞ</f>do not harm the oil and wine!”
6-7 <pb/>When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of <f>ⓟ</f>the fourth living creature say, “Come!”
6-8 And I looked, and behold, <f>ⓠ</f>a pale horse! And its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill <f>ⓡ</f>with sword and with famine and with pestilence and <f>ⓢ</f>by wild beasts of the earth.
6-9 <pb/>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under <f>ⓣ</f>the altar <f>ⓤ</f>the souls of those who had been slain <f>ⓥ</f>for the word of God and for <f>ⓦ</f>the witness they had borne.
6-10 They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, <f>ⓧ</f>holy and true, <f>ⓨ</f>how long <f>ⓩ</f>before you will judge and <f>ⓐ</f>avenge our blood on <f>ⓑ</f>those who dwell on the earth?”
6-11 Then they were each given <f>ⓒ</f>a white robe and <f>ⓓ</f>told to rest a little longer, <f>ⓔ</f>until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.
6-12 <pb/>When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, <f>ⓖ</f>there was a great earthquake, and <f>ⓗ</f>the sun became black as <f>ⓘ</f>sackcloth, the full moon became like blood,
6-13 and <f>ⓙ</f>the stars of the sky fell to the earth <f>ⓚ</f>as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.
6-14 <f>ⓛ</f> The sky vanished <f>ⓜ</f>like a scroll that is being rolled up, and <f>ⓝ</f>every mountain and island was removed from its place.
6-15 Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave <f>[4]</f> and free, <f>ⓞ</f>hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,
6-16 <f>ⓟ</f> calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of <f>ⓠ</f>him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
6-17 for <f>ⓡ</f>the great day of their wrath has come, and <f>ⓢ</f>who can stand?”
