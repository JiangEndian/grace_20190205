42-1 <pb/>When <f>ⓐ</f>Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”
42-2 And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may <f>ⓑ</f>live and not die.”
42-3 So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
42-4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, <f>ⓒ</f>Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for <f>ⓓ</f>he feared that harm might happen to him.
42-5 Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
42-6 <pb/>Now Joseph was governor <f>ⓔ</f>over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and <f>ⓕ</f>bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.
42-7 Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and <f>ⓖ</f>spoke roughly to them. “Where do you come from?” he said. They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”
42-8 And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
42-9 And Joseph <f>ⓗ</f>remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. <f>ⓘ</f>And he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”
42-10 They said to him, “No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food.
42-11 We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.”
42-12 <pb/>He said to them, “No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see.”
42-13 And they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one <f>ⓙ</f>is no more.”
42-14 But Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you. You are spies.
42-15 By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
42-16 Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.”
42-17 And he put them all together in custody for three days.
42-18 <pb/>On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, <f>ⓚ</f>for I fear God:
42-19 if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry <f>ⓛ</f>grain for the famine of your households,
42-20 and <f>ⓜ</f>bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they did so.
42-21 Then they said to one another, <f>ⓝ</f>“In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.”
42-22 And Reuben answered them, <f>ⓞ</f>“Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now <f>ⓟ</f>there comes a reckoning for his blood.”
42-23 They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.
42-24 Then he turned away from them and <f>ⓠ</f>wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
42-25 <f>ⓡ</f> And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.
42-26 <pb/>Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed.
42-27 And as <f>ⓢ</f>one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at <f>ⓣ</f>the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack.
42-28 He said to his brothers, “My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!” At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”
42-29 <pb/>When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,
42-30 “The man, the lord of the land, <f>ⓤ</f>spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land.
42-31 But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we have never been spies.
42-32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One <f>ⓥ</f>is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’
42-33 Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, <f>ⓦ</f>‘By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take <f>ⓧ</f>grain for the famine of your households, and go your way.
42-34 Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall <f>ⓨ</f>trade in the land.’”
42-35 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
42-36 And Jacob their father said to them, “You have <f>ⓐ</f>bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.”
42-37 Then Reuben said to his father, “Kill <f>ⓑ</f>my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.”
42-38 But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for <f>ⓒ</f>his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. <f>ⓓ</f>If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, <f>ⓔ</f>you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”
4-1 <pb/>Now when <f>ⓐ</f>the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the LORD, the God of Israel,
4-2 they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers' houses and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever <f>ⓑ</f>since the days of <f>ⓒ</f>Esarhaddon king of Assyria <f>ⓓ</f>who brought us here.”
4-3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses in Israel said to them, <f>ⓔ</f>“You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the LORD, the God of Israel, <f>ⓕ</f>as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”
4-4 <pb/>Then <f>ⓖ</f>the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to build
4-5 and bribed counselors against them to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
4-6 <pb/>And in the reign of <f>ⓗ</f>Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
4-7 <pb/>In the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam and <f>ⓘ</f>Mithredath and Tabeel and the rest of their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written <f>ⓙ</f>in Aramaic and translated. <f>[1]</f>
4-8 Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows:
4-9 Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the <f>ⓚ</f>judges, the <f>ⓛ</f>governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the <f>ⓜ</f>Elamites,
4-10 and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble <f>ⓝ</f>Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River.
4-11 (This is a copy of the letter that they sent.) “To Artaxerxes the king: Your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River, send greeting. And now
4-12 be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are <f>ⓞ</f>finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.
4-13 Now be it known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished, they will not pay <f>ⓟ</f>tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will be impaired.
4-14 Now because we eat the salt of the palace <f>[2]</f> and it is not fitting for us to witness the king's dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king,
4-15 in order that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will find in the book of the records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that sedition was stirred up in it from of old. That was why this city was laid waste.
4-16 We make known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished, you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River.”
4-17 <pb/>The king sent an answer: “To Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, greeting. And now
4-18 the letter that you sent to us has been <f>ⓠ</f>plainly read before me.
4-19 And I made a decree, and search has been made, and it has been found that this city from of old has risen against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
4-20 And mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, <f>ⓡ</f>who ruled over the whole province Beyond the River, to whom <f>ⓢ</f>tribute, custom, and toll were paid.
4-21 Therefore make a decree that these men be made to cease, and that this city be not rebuilt, until a decree is made by me.
4-22 And take care not to be slack in this matter. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the king?”
4-23 <pb/>Then, when the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their associates, they went in haste to the Jews at Jerusalem and by force and power made them cease.
4-24 Then the work on the house of God that is in Jerusalem stopped, and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
27-1 <pb/>In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah <f>[1]</f> the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD.
27-2 Thus the LORD said to me: <f>ⓐ</f>“Make yourself straps and <f>ⓑ</f>yoke-bars, and put them on your neck.
27-3 Send word <f>[2]</f> to the king of <f>ⓒ</f>Edom, the king of <f>ⓓ</f>Moab, the king of the sons of <f>ⓔ</f>Ammon, the king of <f>ⓕ</f>Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
27-4 Give them this charge for their masters: ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters:
27-5 “It is I who <f>ⓖ</f>by my great power and my outstretched arm <f>ⓗ</f>have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, <f>ⓘ</f>and I give it to whomever it seems right to me.
27-6 <f>ⓙ</f> Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, <f>ⓚ</f>my servant, <f>ⓛ</f>and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him.
27-7 <f>ⓜ</f> All the nations shall serve him and <f>ⓝ</f>his son and <f>ⓞ</f>his grandson, <f>ⓟ</f>until the time of his own land comes. <f>ⓠ</f>Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.
27-8 <pb/>“‘“But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, <f>ⓡ</f>and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation <f>ⓢ</f>with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, declares the LORD, until I have consumed it by his hand.
27-9 So <f>ⓣ</f>do not listen to your <f>ⓤ</f>prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your <f>ⓥ</f>fortune-tellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon.’
27-10 <f>ⓦ</f> For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish.
27-11 <f>ⓧ</f> But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there, declares the LORD.”’”
27-12 <pb/>To <f>ⓨ</f>Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: <f>ⓩ</f>“Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and <f>ⓐ</f>serve him and his people and live.
27-13 <f>ⓑ</f> Why will you and your people die <f>ⓒ</f>by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, <f>ⓓ</f>as the LORD has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
27-14 <f>ⓔ</f> Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ <f>ⓕ</f>for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.
27-15 I have not sent them, declares the LORD, but <f>ⓖ</f>they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.”
27-16 <pb/>Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓗ</f>Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, <f>ⓘ</f>‘Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,’ <f>ⓙ</f>for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.
27-17 <f>ⓚ</f> Do not listen to them; <f>ⓛ</f>serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city <f>ⓜ</f>become a desolation?
27-18 If they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, then <f>ⓝ</f>let them intercede with the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓞ</f>that the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon.
27-19 <f>ⓟ</f> For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
27-20 which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, <f>ⓠ</f>when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem —
27-21 thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, <f>ⓡ</f>concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
27-22 <f>ⓢ</f> They shall be carried to Babylon <f>ⓣ</f>and remain there <f>ⓤ</f>until the day when I visit them, declares the LORD. <f>ⓥ</f>Then I will bring them back <f>ⓦ</f>and restore them to this place.”
5-1 <pb/>For every high priest chosen from among men <f>ⓐ</f>is appointed to act on behalf of men <f>ⓑ</f>in relation to God, <f>ⓒ</f>to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
5-2 <f>ⓓ</f> He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself <f>ⓔ</f>is beset with weakness.
5-3 Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins <f>ⓕ</f>just as he does for those of the people.
5-4 And <f>ⓖ</f>no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, <f>ⓗ</f>just as Aaron was.
5-5 <pb/>So also Christ <f>ⓘ</f>did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“You are my Son, </t><t>today I have begotten you”; </t>
5-6 <pb/>as he says also in another place, <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“You are a priest forever, </t><t>after the order of Melchizedek.” </t>
5-7 <pb/>In the days of his flesh, <f>ⓛ</f>Jesus <f>[1]</f> offered up prayers and supplications, <f>ⓜ</f>with loud cries and tears, to him <f>ⓝ</f>who was able to save him from death, and <f>ⓞ</f>he was heard because of his reverence.
5-8 Although <f>ⓟ</f>he was a son, <f>ⓠ</f>he learned obedience through what he suffered.
5-9 And <f>ⓡ</f>being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,
5-10 being designated by God a high priest <f>ⓢ</f>after the order of Melchizedek.
5-11 <pb/>About this we have much to say, and it is <f>ⓣ</f>hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.
5-12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again <f>ⓤ</f>the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need <f>ⓥ</f>milk, not solid food,
5-13 for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is <f>ⓦ</f>a child.
5-14 But solid food is for <f>ⓧ</f>the mature, for those who have their powers <f>ⓨ</f>of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.
