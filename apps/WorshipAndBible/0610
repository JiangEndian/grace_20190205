16-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses after <f>ⓐ</f>the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the LORD and died,
16-2 and the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron your brother not to <f>ⓑ</f>come at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die. For <f>ⓒ</f>I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat.
16-3 But in this way Aaron shall come into the Holy Place: <f>ⓓ</f>with a bull from the herd for a sin offering and <f>ⓔ</f>a ram for a burnt offering.
16-4 He shall put on <f>ⓕ</f>the holy linen coat and shall have the linen undergarment on his body, and he shall tie the linen sash around his waist, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. <f>ⓖ</f>He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on.
16-5 And he shall take from <f>ⓗ</f>the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
16-6 <pb/>“Aaron shall <f>ⓘ</f>offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall <f>ⓙ</f>make atonement for himself and for his house.
16-7 Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
16-8 And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for <f>ⓚ</f>Azazel. <f>[1]</f>
16-9 And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the LORD and use it as a sin offering,
16-10 but the goat on which the lot fell for <f>ⓛ</f>Azazel shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to <f>ⓜ</f>Azazel.
16-11 <pb/>“Aaron shall present <f>ⓝ</f>the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall kill the bull as a sin offering for himself.
16-12 And he shall take <f>ⓞ</f>a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small, and he shall bring it inside the veil
16-13 <f>ⓟ</f> and put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover <f>ⓠ</f>the mercy seat that is over the testimony, so that he does not die.
16-14 And <f>ⓡ</f>he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat on the east side, and in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
16-15 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood <f>ⓣ</f>inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it over the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat.
16-16 Thus he shall <f>ⓤ</f>make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel and because of their transgressions, all their sins. And so he shall do for the tent of meeting, which dwells with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
16-17 <f>ⓥ</f> No one may be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel.
16-18 Then he shall go out to the altar that is <f>ⓦ</f>before the LORD and <f>ⓧ</f>make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar all around.
16-19 And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel.
16-20 <pb/>“And when he has made an end of <f>ⓨ</f>atoning for the Holy Place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat.
16-21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins. And he shall <f>ⓩ</f>put them on the head of the goat and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness.
16-22 The goat shall <f>ⓐ</f>bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area, and <f>ⓑ</f>he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness.
16-23 <pb/>“Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and <f>ⓒ</f>shall take off the linen garments that he put on when he went into the Holy Place and shall leave them there.
16-24 And he shall bathe his body in water in a holy place and put on his garments and come out and <f>ⓓ</f>offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people.
16-25 And <f>ⓔ</f>the fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.
16-26 And he who lets the goat go to <f>ⓕ</f>Azazel shall wash his clothes and <f>ⓖ</f>bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
16-27 <f>ⓗ</f> And the bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp. Their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be burned up with fire.
16-28 And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.
16-29 <pb/>“And it shall be a statute to you forever that <f>ⓘ</f>in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall <f>ⓙ</f>afflict yourselves <f>[2]</f> and shall do no work, either <f>ⓚ</f>the native or the stranger who sojourns among you.
16-30 For on this day shall atonement be made for you <f>ⓛ</f>to cleanse you. You shall be clean before the LORD from all your sins.
16-31 <f>ⓜ</f> It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall <f>ⓝ</f>afflict yourselves; it is a statute forever.
16-32 <f>ⓞ</f> And the priest who is anointed and <f>ⓟ</f>consecrated as priest in his father's place <f>ⓠ</f>shall make atonement, wearing the holy linen garments.
16-33 He shall make atonement for <f>ⓡ</f>the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for <f>ⓢ</f>the altar, and he shall make atonement for <f>ⓣ</f>the priests and for <f>ⓤ</f>all the people of the assembly.
16-34 And this shall be a statute forever for you, that atonement may be made for the people of Israel <f>ⓥ</f>once in the year because of all their sins.” And Aaron <f>[3]</f> did as the LORD commanded Moses.
35-1 <pb/>And Elihu answered and said:
35-2 <pb/><t>“Do you think this to be just? </t><t>Do you say, <f>ⓐ</f>‘It is my right before God,’</t>
35-3 <t>that you ask, <f>ⓑ</f>‘What advantage have I? </t><t>How am I better off than if I had sinned?’</t>
35-4 <t>I will answer you </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>your friends with you.</t>
35-5 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Look at the heavens, and see; </t><t>and behold the clouds, which are higher than you.</t>
35-6 <t>If you have sinned, <f>ⓔ</f>what do you accomplish against him? </t><t>And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?</t>
35-7 <t><f>ⓕ</f> If you are righteous, what do you give to him? </t><t>Or what does he receive from your hand?</t>
35-8 <t>Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself, </t><t>and your righteousness <f>ⓖ</f>a son of man. </t>
35-9 <pb/><t>“Because of the multitude of <f>ⓗ</f>oppressions people <f>ⓘ</f>cry out; </t><t>they call for help because of the arm of <f>ⓙ</f>the mighty. <f>[1]</f></t>
35-10 <t>But none says, ‘Where is God my <f>ⓚ</f>Maker, </t><t>who gives <f>ⓛ</f>songs in the night,</t>
35-11 <t>who teaches us <f>ⓜ</f>more than the beasts of the earth </t><t>and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’</t>
35-12 <t>There they <f>ⓝ</f>cry out, but he does not answer, </t><t>because of the pride of evil men.</t>
35-13 <t>Surely God does not hear an empty cry, </t><t>nor does the Almighty regard it.</t>
35-14 <t>How much less when you say that you <f>ⓞ</f>do not see him, </t><t>that the case is before him, and you are <f>ⓟ</f>waiting for him!</t>
35-15 <t>And now, because <f>ⓠ</f>his anger does not punish, </t><t>and he does not take much note of transgression, <f>[2]</f></t>
35-16 <t>Job opens his mouth in empty talk; </t><t>he <f>ⓡ</f>multiplies words <f>ⓢ</f>without knowledge.” </t>
34-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me:
34-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓑ</f>Ah, shepherds of Israel <f>ⓒ</f>who have been feeding yourselves! <f>ⓓ</f>Should not shepherds feed the sheep?
34-3 <f>ⓔ</f> You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, <f>ⓕ</f>you slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed the sheep.
34-4 <f>ⓖ</f> The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, <f>ⓗ</f>the injured you have not bound up, <f>ⓘ</f>the strayed you have not brought back, <f>ⓙ</f>the lost you have not sought, and with force and <f>ⓚ</f>harshness you have ruled them.
34-5 <f>ⓛ</f> So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd, and <f>ⓜ</f>they became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered;
34-6 they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. My sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, <f>ⓝ</f>with none to search or seek for them.
34-7 <pb/>“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
34-8 <f>ⓞ</f> As I live, declares the Lord GOD, surely because <f>ⓟ</f>my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd, and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep,
34-9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:
34-10 Thus says the Lord GOD, <f>ⓠ</f>Behold, I am against the shepherds, and <f>ⓡ</f>I will require my sheep at their hand and <f>ⓢ</f>put a stop to their feeding the sheep. <f>ⓣ</f>No longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. <f>ⓤ</f>I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them.
34-11 <pb/>“For thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓥ</f>Behold, I, I <f>ⓦ</f>myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out.
34-12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on <f>ⓧ</f>a day of clouds and <f>ⓨ</f>thick darkness.
34-13 And I will bring them out from the peoples <f>ⓩ</f>and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land. And I will feed them on <f>ⓐ</f>the mountains of Israel, by the ravines, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
34-14 <f>ⓑ</f> I will feed them with good pasture, and on the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing land. <f>ⓒ</f>There they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on rich pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel.
34-15 <f>ⓓ</f> I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, <f>ⓔ</f>and I myself will make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD.
34-16 <f>ⓕ</f> I will seek the lost, <f>ⓖ</f>and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, and <f>ⓗ</f>the fat and the strong I will destroy. <f>[1]</f> I will feed them in justice.
34-17 <pb/>“As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: <f>ⓘ</f>Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and <f>ⓙ</f>male goats.
34-18 Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of <f>ⓚ</f>clear water, that you must muddy the rest of the water with your feet?
34-19 And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?
34-20 <pb/>“Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: Behold, I, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
34-21 Because you push with side and shoulder, and <f>ⓛ</f>thrust at all the <f>ⓜ</f>weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad,
34-22 I will rescue <f>[2]</f> my flock; <f>ⓝ</f>they shall no longer be a prey. And I will judge between sheep and sheep.
34-23 And <f>ⓞ</f>I will set up over them one shepherd, <f>ⓟ</f>my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
34-24 And <f>ⓠ</f>I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them. <f>ⓡ</f>I am the LORD; I have spoken.
34-25 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> “I will make with them a covenant of peace and <f>ⓣ</f>banish wild beasts from the land, <f>ⓤ</f>so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.
34-26 And I will make them and the places all around my hill <f>ⓥ</f>a blessing, and <f>ⓦ</f>I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be <f>ⓧ</f>showers of blessing.
34-27 <f>ⓨ</f> And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, <f>ⓩ</f>and they shall be secure in their land. And <f>ⓐ</f>they shall know that I am the LORD, when <f>ⓑ</f>I break the bars of their yoke, and <f>ⓒ</f>deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
34-28 <f>ⓓ</f> They shall no more be a prey to the nations, <f>ⓔ</f>nor shall the beasts of the land devour them. <f>ⓕ</f>They shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.
34-29 And I will provide for them <f>ⓖ</f>renowned plantations so that <f>ⓗ</f>they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer <f>ⓘ</f>suffer the reproach of the nations.
34-30 And they shall know that <f>ⓙ</f>I am the LORD their God with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Lord GOD.
34-31 And you are my sheep, <f>ⓚ</f>human sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, declares the Lord GOD.”
