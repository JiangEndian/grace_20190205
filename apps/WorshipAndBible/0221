24-1 <pb/>The divisions of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of <f>ⓐ</f>Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
24-2 <f>ⓑ</f> But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar became the priests.
24-3 With the help of <f>ⓒ</f>Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service.
24-4 Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, they organized them under sixteen heads of fathers' houses of the sons of Eleazar, and eight of the sons of Ithamar.
24-5 They divided them <f>ⓓ</f>by lot, all alike, for there were sacred officers and officers of God among both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar.
24-6 And the scribe Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king and the princes and Zadok the priest and <f>ⓔ</f>Ahimelech the son of Abiathar and the heads of the fathers' houses of the priests and of the Levites, one father's house being chosen for Eleazar and one chosen for Ithamar.
24-7 <pb/>The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
24-8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
24-9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
24-10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to <f>ⓕ</f>Abijah,
24-11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
24-12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
24-13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
24-14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
24-15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
24-16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
24-17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
24-18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
24-19 These had as their appointed duty in their service <f>ⓖ</f>to come into the house of the LORD according to the procedure established for them by Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.
24-20 <pb/>And of the rest of the sons of Levi: <f>ⓗ</f>of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
24-21 <f>ⓘ</f> Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.
24-22 Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
24-23 <f>ⓙ</f> The sons of Hebron: <f>[1]</f> Jeriah the chief, <f>[2]</f> Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
24-24 <f>ⓚ</f> The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
24-25 The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
24-26 <f>ⓛ</f> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Jaaziah: Beno. <f>[3]</f>
24-27 The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
24-28 Of Mahli: Eleazar, <f>ⓜ</f>who had no sons.
24-29 Of Kish, the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.
24-30 <f>ⓝ</f> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers' houses.
24-31 These also, the head of each father's house and his younger brother alike, <f>ⓞ</f>cast lots, just as their brothers the sons of Aaron, in the presence of King David, <f>ⓟ</f>Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of fathers' houses of the priests and of the Levites.
48-1 <pb/><t>Hear this, O house of Jacob, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>who are called by the name of Israel, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>who came from the waters of Judah, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>who swear by the name of the LORD </t><t>and confess the God of Israel, </t><t>but not in truth or right.</t>
48-2 <t>For they call themselves after the holy city, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>and stay themselves on the God of Israel; </t><t>the LORD of hosts is his name. </t>
48-3 <pb/><t>“The former things <f>ⓔ</f>I declared of old; </t><t>they went out from my mouth, and I announced them; </t><t>then suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.</t>
48-4 <t>Because I know that <f>ⓕ</f>you are obstinate, </t><t>and your neck is an iron sinew </t><t>and your forehead brass,</t>
48-5 <t><f>ⓖ</f> I declared them to you from of old, </t><t>before they came to pass I announced them to you, </t><t>lest you should say, <f>ⓗ</f>‘My idol did them, </t><t>my carved image and my metal image commanded them.’ </t>
48-6 <pb/><t>“You have heard; now see all this; </t><t>and will you not declare it? </t><t>From this time forth <f>ⓘ</f>I announce to you new things, </t><t>hidden things that you have not known.</t>
48-7 <t>They are created now, not long ago; </t><t>before today you have never heard of them, </t><t>lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’</t>
48-8 <t>You have never heard, you have never known, </t><t>from of old your ear has not been opened. </t><t>For I knew that you would surely deal treacherously, </t><t>and that <f>ⓙ</f>from before birth you were called a rebel. </t>
48-9 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> “For my name's sake I defer my anger; </t><t>for the sake of my praise I restrain it for you, </t><t>that I may not cut you off.</t>
48-10 <t>Behold, I have refined you, <f>ⓛ</f>but not as silver; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>I have tried <f>[1]</f> you in the furnace of affliction.</t>
48-11 <t><f>ⓝ</f> For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, </t><t>for how should my name <f>[2]</f> be profaned? </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>My glory I will not give to another. </t>
48-12 <pb/><t>“Listen to me, O Jacob, </t><t>and Israel, whom I called! </t><t>I am he; <f>ⓟ</f>I am the first, </t><t>and I am the last.</t>
48-13 <t>My hand <f>ⓠ</f>laid the foundation of the earth, </t><t>and my right hand <f>ⓡ</f>spread out the heavens; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>when I call to them, </t><t>they stand forth together. </t>
48-14 <pb/><t>“Assemble, all of you, and listen! </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>Who among them has declared these things? </t><t>The LORD loves him; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, </t><t>and his arm shall be against <f>ⓥ</f>the Chaldeans.</t>
48-15 <t><f>ⓦ</f> I, even I, have spoken and called him; </t><t>I have brought him, and he will prosper in his way.</t>
48-16 <t><f>ⓧ</f> Draw near to me, hear this: </t><t>from the beginning I have not spoken in secret, </t><t>from the time it came to be I have been there.” </t><t>And now <f>ⓨ</f>the Lord GOD has sent me, and his Spirit. </t>
48-17 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD, </t><t>your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: </t><t>“I am the LORD your God, </t><t>who teaches you to profit, </t><t>who leads you in the way you should go.</t>
48-18 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Oh that you had paid attention to my commandments! </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>Then your peace would have been like a river, </t><t>and your righteousness like the waves of the sea;</t>
48-19 <t><f>ⓑ</f> your offspring would have been like the sand, </t><t>and your descendants like its grains; </t><t>their name would never be cut off </t><t>or destroyed from before me.” </t>
48-20 <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> Go out from Babylon, flee from <f>ⓓ</f>Chaldea, </t><t>declare this <f>ⓔ</f>with a shout of joy, proclaim it, </t><t>send it out to the end of the earth; </t><t>say, <f>ⓕ</f>“The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!”</t>
48-21 <t><f>ⓖ</f> They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>he made water flow for them from the rock; </t><t>he split the rock and the water gushed out. </t>
48-22 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> “There is no peace,” says the LORD, “for the wicked.” </t>
1-1 <pb/>Paul, an <f>ⓐ</f>apostle — <f>ⓑ</f>not from men nor through man, but <f>ⓒ</f>through Jesus Christ and God the Father, <f>ⓓ</f>who raised him from the dead —
1-2 and all <f>ⓔ</f>the brothers <f>[1]</f> who are with me, <pb/>To <f>ⓕ</f>the churches of Galatia:
1-3 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Grace to you and peace <f>ⓗ</f>from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
1-4 <f>ⓘ</f> who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present <f>ⓙ</f>evil age, according to the will of <f>ⓚ</f>our God and Father,
1-5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
1-6 <pb/>I am astonished that you are <f>ⓛ</f>so quickly deserting <f>ⓜ</f>him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to <f>ⓝ</f>a different gospel —
1-7 <f>ⓞ</f> not that there is another one, but <f>ⓟ</f>there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
1-8 But even if we or <f>ⓠ</f>an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, <f>ⓡ</f>let him be accursed.
1-9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, <f>ⓢ</f>let him be accursed.
1-10 <pb/>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying <f>ⓣ</f>to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a <f>ⓤ</f>servant <f>[2]</f> of Christ.
1-11 <pb/>For <f>ⓥ</f>I would have you know, brothers, that <f>ⓦ</f>the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. <f>[3]</f>
1-12 <f>ⓧ</f> For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it <f>ⓨ</f>through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
1-13 For you have heard of <f>ⓩ</f>my former life in Judaism, how <f>ⓐ</f>I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it.
1-14 And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely <f>ⓑ</f>zealous was I for <f>ⓒ</f>the traditions of my fathers.
1-15 But when he <f>ⓓ</f>who had set me apart <f>ⓔ</f>before I was born, <f>[4]</f> and who <f>ⓕ</f>called me by his grace,
1-16 was pleased to reveal his Son to <f>[5]</f> me, in order <f>ⓖ</f>that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; <f>[6]</f>
1-17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
1-18 <pb/>Then <f>ⓗ</f>after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days.
1-19 But I saw none of the other apostles except James <f>ⓘ</f>the Lord's brother.
1-20 (In what I am writing to you, <f>ⓙ</f>before God, I do not lie!)
1-21 <f>ⓚ</f> Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
1-22 And I was still unknown in person to <f>ⓛ</f>the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
1-23 They only were hearing it said, “He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
1-24 And they glorified God because of me.
