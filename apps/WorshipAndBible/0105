2-1 <pb/>Now when the LORD was about to <f>ⓐ</f>take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and <f>ⓑ</f>Elisha were on their way from <f>ⓒ</f>Gilgal.
2-2 And Elijah said to Elisha, <f>ⓓ</f>“Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, <f>ⓔ</f>“As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.
2-3 And <f>ⓕ</f>the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that today the LORD will take away your master from over you?” And he said, “Yes, I know it; keep quiet.”
2-4 <pb/>Elijah said to him, “Elisha, <f>ⓖ</f>please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to <f>ⓗ</f>Jericho.” But he said, <f>ⓘ</f>“As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.
2-5 <f>ⓙ</f> The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that today the LORD will take away your master from over you?” And he answered, “Yes, I know it; keep quiet.”
2-6 <pb/>Then Elijah said to him, <f>ⓚ</f>“Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.
2-7 Fifty men of <f>ⓛ</f>the sons of the prophets also went and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan.
2-8 Then Elijah <f>ⓜ</f>took his cloak and rolled it up and struck the water, <f>ⓝ</f>and the water was parted to the one side and to the other, till the two of them could go over on dry ground.
2-9 <pb/>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please let there be a double portion of your spirit on me.”
2-10 And he said, “You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it shall be so for you, but if you do not see me, it shall not be so.”
2-11 And as they still went on and talked, behold, <f>ⓞ</f>chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
2-12 And Elisha saw it and he cried, “My father, my father! <f>ⓟ</f>The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw him no more. <pb/>Then he took hold of his own clothes <f>ⓠ</f>and tore them in two pieces.
2-13 And he took up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
2-14 Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water, saying, “Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” And when he had struck the water, <f>ⓡ</f>the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.
2-15 <pb/>Now when <f>ⓢ</f>the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him opposite them, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
2-16 And they said to him, “Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. It may be that <f>ⓣ</f>the Spirit of the LORD has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.” And he said, “You shall not send.”
2-17 But when they urged him <f>ⓤ</f>till he was ashamed, he said, “Send.” They sent therefore fifty men. And for three days they sought him but did not find him.
2-18 And they came back to him while he was staying at Jericho, and he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”
2-19 <pb/>Now the men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees, but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful.”
2-20 He said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.
2-21 Then he went to the spring of water and <f>ⓥ</f>threw salt in it and said, “Thus says the LORD, I have healed this water; from now on neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it.”
2-22 So the water has been healed to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke.
2-23 <pb/>He went up from there to Bethel, and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”
2-24 And he turned around, and when he saw them, <f>ⓦ</f>he cursed them in the name of the LORD. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys.
2-25 From there he went on to <f>ⓧ</f>Mount Carmel, and from there he returned <f>ⓨ</f>to Samaria.
1-1 <pb/>The <f>ⓐ</f>vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem <f>ⓑ</f>in the days of <f>ⓒ</f>Uzziah, <f>ⓓ</f>Jotham, <f>ⓔ</f>Ahaz, and <f>ⓕ</f>Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
1-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O <f>ⓗ</f>earth; </t><t>for the LORD has spoken: </t><t>“Children <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>have I reared and brought up, </t><t>but they have rebelled against me.</t>
1-3 <t>The ox <f>ⓙ</f>knows its owner, </t><t>and the donkey its master's crib, </t><t>but Israel does <f>ⓚ</f>not know, </t><t>my people do not understand.” </t>
1-4 <pb/><t>Ah, sinful nation, </t><t>a people laden with iniquity, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>offspring of evildoers, </t><t>children who deal corruptly! </t><t>They have forsaken the LORD, </t><t>they have <f>ⓜ</f>despised <f>ⓝ</f>the Holy One of Israel, </t><t>they are utterly <f>ⓞ</f>estranged. </t>
1-5 <pb/><t>Why will you still be <f>ⓟ</f>struck down? </t><t>Why will you <f>ⓠ</f>continue to rebel? </t><t>The whole head is sick, </t><t>and the whole heart faint.</t>
1-6 <t><f>ⓡ</f> From the sole of the foot even to the head, </t><t>there is no soundness in it, </t><t>but bruises and sores </t><t>and raw wounds; </t><t>they are <f>ⓢ</f>not pressed out or bound up </t><t>or softened with oil. </t>
1-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> Your country lies desolate; </t><t>your cities are burned with fire; </t><t>in your very presence </t><t>foreigners devour your land; </t><t>it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.</t>
1-8 <t>And <f>ⓤ</f>the daughter of Zion is left </t><t>like a <f>ⓥ</f>booth in a vineyard, </t><t>like a lodge in a cucumber field, </t><t>like a besieged city. </t>
1-9 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> If the LORD of hosts </t><t>had not left us <f>ⓧ</f>a few survivors, </t><t>we should have been like <f>ⓨ</f>Sodom, </t><t>and become like <f>ⓩ</f>Gomorrah. </t>
1-10 <pb/><t>Hear the word of the LORD, </t><t>you rulers of <f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f>Sodom! </t><t>Give ear to the teaching <f>[2]</f> of our God, </t><t>you people of <f>ⓒ</f>Gomorrah!</t>
1-11 <t><f>ⓓ</f> “What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? </t><t>says the LORD; </t><t>I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams </t><t>and the fat of well-fed beasts; </t><t>I do not delight in the blood of bulls, </t><t>or of lambs, or of goats. </t>
1-12 <pb/><t>“When you come to <f>ⓔ</f>appear before me, </t><t>who has required of you </t><t>this trampling of my courts?</t>
1-13 <t>Bring no more vain offerings; </t><t>incense is an abomination to me. </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>New moon and Sabbath and the <f>ⓖ</f>calling of convocations — </t><t>I cannot endure <f>ⓗ</f>iniquity and <f>ⓘ</f>solemn assembly.</t>
1-14 <t>Your <f>ⓙ</f>new moons and your appointed feasts </t><t>my soul hates; </t><t>they have become a burden to me; </t><t>I am weary of bearing them.</t>
1-15 <t>When you <f>ⓚ</f>spread out your hands, </t><t>I will hide my eyes from you; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>even though you make many prayers, </t><t>I will not listen; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>your hands are full of blood.</t>
1-16 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; </t><t>remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>cease to do evil,</t>
1-17 <t>learn to do good; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>seek justice, </t><t>correct oppression; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>bring justice to the fatherless, </t><t>plead the widow's cause. </t>
1-18 <pb/><t>“Come now, <f>ⓡ</f>let us reason <f>[3]</f> together, says the LORD: </t><t>though your sins are like scarlet, </t><t>they shall be as <f>ⓢ</f>white as snow; </t><t>though they are red like crimson, </t><t>they shall become like wool.</t>
1-19 <t><f>ⓣ</f> If you are willing and obedient, </t><t>you shall eat the good of the land;</t>
1-20 <t>but if you refuse and rebel, </t><t>you shall be eaten by the sword; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.” </t>
1-21 <pb/><t>How the faithful city </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>has become a whore, <f>[4]</f> </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>she who was full of justice! </t><t>Righteousness lodged in her, </t><t>but now murderers.</t>
1-22 <t><f>ⓧ</f> Your silver has become dross, </t><t>your best wine mixed with water.</t>
1-23 <t>Your princes are rebels </t><t>and companions of thieves. </t><t>Everyone <f>ⓨ</f>loves a bribe </t><t>and runs after gifts. </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>They do not bring justice to the fatherless, </t><t>and the widow's cause does not come to them. </t>
1-24 <pb/><t>Therefore the <f>ⓐ</f>Lord declares, </t><t>the LORD of hosts, </t><t>the <f>ⓑ</f>Mighty One of Israel: </t><t>“Ah, I will get relief from my enemies </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and avenge myself on my foes.</t>
1-25 <t><f>ⓓ</f> I will turn my hand against you </t><t>and will smelt away your <f>ⓔ</f>dross as with lye </t><t>and remove all your alloy.</t>
1-26 <t>And I will restore your judges <f>ⓕ</f>as at the first, </t><t>and your counselors as at the beginning. </t><t>Afterward <f>ⓖ</f>you shall be called the city of righteousness, </t><t>the faithful city.” </t>
1-27 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> Zion shall be redeemed by justice, </t><t>and those in her who repent, by righteousness.</t>
1-28 <t><f>ⓘ</f> But rebels and sinners shall be broken together, </t><t>and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</t>
1-29 <t><f>ⓙ</f> For they <f>[5]</f> shall be ashamed of <f>ⓚ</f>the oaks </t><t>that you desired; </t><t>and you shall blush for <f>ⓛ</f>the gardens </t><t>that you have chosen.</t>
1-30 <t>For you shall be <f>ⓜ</f>like an oak </t><t>whose leaf withers, </t><t>and like a garden without water.</t>
1-31 <t>And the strong shall become <f>ⓝ</f>tinder, </t><t>and his work a spark, </t><t>and both of them shall burn together, </t><t>with <f>ⓞ</f>none to quench them. </t>
27-1 <pb/>And when it was decided <f>ⓐ</f>that <f>ⓑ</f>we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan <f>ⓒ</f>Cohort named Julius.
27-2 And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by <f>ⓓ</f>Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
27-3 The next day we put in at Sidon. And <f>ⓔ</f>Julius <f>ⓕ</f>treated Paul kindly and <f>ⓖ</f>gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for.
27-4 And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.
27-5 And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.
27-6 There the centurion found <f>ⓗ</f>a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board.
27-7 We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.
27-8 Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
27-9 <pb/>Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even <f>ⓘ</f>the Fast <f>[1]</f> was already over, Paul advised them,
27-10 saying, “Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with <f>ⓙ</f>injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”
27-11 But the centurion paid more attention to <f>ⓚ</f>the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.
27-12 And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.
27-13 <pb/>Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore.
27-14 But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, <f>ⓛ</f>struck down from the land.
27-15 And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.
27-16 Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, <f>[2]</f> we managed with difficulty to secure the ship's boat.
27-17 After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would <f>ⓜ</f>run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, <f>[3]</f> and thus they were driven along.
27-18 Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day <f>ⓝ</f>to jettison the cargo.
27-19 And on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.
27-20 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
27-21 <pb/>Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, <f>ⓞ</f>you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this <f>ⓟ</f>injury and loss.
27-22 Yet now I urge you to <f>ⓠ</f>take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
27-23 For this very night <f>ⓡ</f>there <f>ⓢ</f>stood before me <f>ⓣ</f>an angel of the God <f>ⓤ</f>to whom I belong and <f>ⓥ</f>whom I worship,
27-24 and he said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; <f>ⓦ</f>you must stand before Caesar. And behold, <f>ⓧ</f>God has granted you all those who sail with you.’
27-25 So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.
27-26 But <f>ⓨ</f>we must <f>ⓩ</f>run aground on some island.”
27-27 <pb/>When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.
27-28 So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. <f>[4]</f> A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms. <f>[5]</f>
27-29 And fearing that we might <f>ⓐ</f>run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.
27-30 And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered <f>ⓑ</f>the ship's boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,
27-31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.”
27-32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it go.
27-33 <pb/>As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.
27-34 Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, <f>[6]</f> for <f>ⓒ</f>not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.”
27-35 And when he had said these things, he took bread, and <f>ⓓ</f>giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat.
27-36 Then they all <f>ⓔ</f>were encouraged and ate some food themselves.
27-37 (We were in all 276 <f>[7]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>persons in the ship.)
27-38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, <f>ⓖ</f>throwing out the wheat into the sea.
27-39 <pb/>Now when it was day, <f>ⓗ</f>they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore.
27-40 So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach.
27-41 But striking a reef, <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf.
27-42 <f>ⓙ</f> The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape.
27-43 But the centurion, <f>ⓚ</f>wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land,
27-44 and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that <f>ⓛ</f>all were brought safely to land.
