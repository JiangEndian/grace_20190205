10-1 <pb/>As soon as Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>doing to Ai and its king <f>ⓑ</f>as he had done to Jericho and its king, and <f>ⓒ</f>how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,
10-2 <f>ⓓ</f> he <f>[2]</f> feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors.
10-3 So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
10-4 “Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon. For <f>ⓔ</f>it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel.”
10-5 Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, <f>ⓕ</f>gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.
10-6 <pb/>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua <f>ⓖ</f>at the camp in Gilgal, saying, “Do not relax your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us.”
10-7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and <f>ⓗ</f>all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
10-8 And the LORD said to Joshua, <f>ⓘ</f>“Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands. <f>ⓙ</f>Not a man of them shall stand before you.”
10-9 So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal.
10-10 <f>ⓚ</f> And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who <f>[3]</f> struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of <f>ⓛ</f>the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
10-11 And as they fled before Israel, while they were <f>ⓜ</f>going down the ascent of Beth-horon, <f>ⓝ</f>the LORD threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword.
10-12 <pb/>At that time Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f>“Sun, stand still at Gibeon, </t><t>and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”</t>
10-13 <t>And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, </t><t>until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. </t> <pb/>Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day.
10-14 <f>ⓟ</f> There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD heeded the voice of a man, for <f>ⓠ</f>the LORD fought for Israel.
10-15 <pb/>So <f>ⓡ</f>Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
10-16 <pb/>These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at <f>ⓢ</f>Makkedah.
10-17 And it was told to Joshua, “The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”
10-18 And Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them,
10-19 but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; <f>ⓣ</f>attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand.”
10-20 When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a great blow <f>ⓤ</f>until they were wiped out, and when the remnant that remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
10-21 then all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. <f>ⓥ</f>Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.
10-22 <pb/>Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me from the cave.”
10-23 And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
10-24 And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near; put your feet on the necks of these kings.” Then they came near and put their feet on their necks.
10-25 And Joshua said to them, <f>ⓦ</f>“Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous. <f>ⓧ</f>For thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.”
10-26 And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees. And <f>ⓨ</f>they hung on the trees until evening.
10-27 But at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and <f>ⓩ</f>they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.
10-28 <pb/>As for <f>ⓐ</f>Makkedah, Joshua captured it on that day and struck it, and its king, with the edge of the sword. He devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah <f>ⓑ</f>just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
10-29 <pb/>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to <f>ⓒ</f>Libnah and fought against Libnah.
10-30 And the LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel. And he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it. And he did to its king <f>ⓓ</f>as he had done to the king of Jericho.
10-31 <pb/>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to <f>ⓔ</f>Lachish and laid siege to it and fought against it.
10-32 And the LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.
10-33 <pb/>Then Horam king of <f>ⓕ</f>Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people, until he left none remaining.
10-34 <pb/>Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to <f>ⓖ</f>Eglon. And they laid siege to it and fought against it.
10-35 And they captured it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. And he devoted every person in it to destruction that day, as he had done to Lachish.
10-36 <pb/>Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to <f>ⓗ</f>Hebron. And they fought against it
10-37 and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it. He left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and devoted it to destruction and every person in it.
10-38 <pb/>Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to <f>ⓘ</f>Debir and fought against it
10-39 and he captured it with its king and all its towns. And they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. Just as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.
10-40 <pb/>So Joshua struck the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland <f>ⓙ</f>and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, <f>ⓚ</f>but devoted to destruction all that breathed, just as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
10-41 And Joshua struck them from <f>ⓛ</f>Kadesh-barnea as far as Gaza, and all the country of <f>ⓜ</f>Goshen, as far as Gibeon.
10-42 And Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, <f>ⓝ</f>because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
10-43 <f>ⓞ</f> Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
84-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f> <pb/><t>How <f>ⓒ</f>lovely is your <f>ⓓ</f>dwelling place, </t><t>O LORD of hosts!</t>
84-2 <t>My soul <f>ⓔ</f>longs, yes, <f>ⓕ</f>faints </t><t>for the courts of the LORD; </t><t>my heart and flesh sing for joy </t><t>to <f>ⓖ</f>the living God. </t>
84-3 <pb/><t>Even the sparrow finds a home, </t><t>and the swallow a nest for herself, </t><t>where she may lay her young, </t><t>at your altars, O LORD of hosts, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>my King and my God.</t>
84-4 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Blessed are those who dwell in your house, </t><t>ever <f>ⓙ</f>singing your praise! <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
84-5 <pb/><t>Blessed are those whose strength is in you, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>in whose heart are the highways to Zion. <f>[2]</f></t>
84-6 <t>As they go through the Valley of Baca </t><t>they make it a place of springs; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>the early rain also covers it with <f>ⓜ</f>pools.</t>
84-7 <t>They go <f>ⓝ</f>from strength to strength; </t><t>each one <f>ⓞ</f>appears before God in Zion. </t>
84-8 <pb/><t>O <f>ⓟ</f>LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; </t><t>give ear, O God of Jacob! <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
84-9 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Behold our <f>ⓡ</f>shield, O God; </t><t>look on the face of your anointed! </t>
84-10 <pb/><t>For a day <f>ⓢ</f>in your courts is better </t><t>than a thousand elsewhere. </t><t>I would rather be <f>ⓣ</f>a doorkeeper in the house of my God </t><t>than dwell in the tents of wickedness.</t>
84-11 <t>For the LORD God is <f>ⓤ</f>a sun and <f>ⓥ</f>shield; </t><t>the LORD bestows favor and honor. </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>No good thing does he withhold </t><t>from those who <f>ⓧ</f>walk uprightly.</t>
84-12 <t>O LORD of hosts, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>blessed is the one who trusts in you! </t>
2-1 <pb/>“And now, <f>ⓐ</f>O priests, <f>ⓑ</f>this command is for you.
2-2 <f>ⓒ</f> If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the LORD of hosts, then I will send <f>ⓓ</f>the curse upon you and I will curse <f>ⓔ</f>your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.
2-3 Behold, <f>ⓕ</f>I will rebuke your offspring, <f>[1]</f> and <f>ⓖ</f>spread dung on your faces, the <f>ⓗ</f>dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it. <f>[2]</f>
2-4 So shall you know that I have sent <f>ⓘ</f>this command to you, that <f>ⓙ</f>my covenant with Levi may stand, says the LORD of hosts.
2-5 My covenant with him was one of life and <f>ⓚ</f>peace, and I gave them to him. <f>ⓛ</f>It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name.
2-6 <f>ⓜ</f> True instruction <f>[3]</f> was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he <f>ⓝ</f>turned many from iniquity.
2-7 For <f>ⓞ</f>the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people <f>[4]</f> should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
2-8 But you have turned aside from the way. <f>ⓟ</f>You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted <f>ⓠ</f>the covenant of Levi, says the LORD of hosts,
2-9 and so <f>ⓡ</f>I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but <f>ⓢ</f>show partiality in your instruction.”
2-10 <pb/>Have we not all <f>ⓣ</f>one Father? Has not <f>ⓤ</f>one God created us? Why then are we <f>ⓥ</f>faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
2-11 Judah has been <f>ⓦ</f>faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For <f>ⓧ</f>Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
2-12 May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant <f>[5]</f> of the man who does this, who <f>ⓨ</f>brings an offering to the LORD of hosts!
2-13 <pb/>And this second thing you do. <f>ⓩ</f>You cover the LORD's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand.
2-14 <f>ⓐ</f> But you say, “Why does he not?” Because the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>was witness between you and the wife of your youth, <f>ⓒ</f>to whom <f>ⓓ</f>you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
2-15 <f>ⓔ</f> Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? <f>[6]</f> And what was the one God <f>[7]</f> seeking? <f>[8]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>Godly offspring. So guard yourselves <f>[9]</f> in your spirit, and let none of you be <f>ⓖ</f>faithless to the wife of your youth.
2-16 “For <f>ⓗ</f>the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, <f>[10]</f> says the LORD, the God of Israel, covers <f>[11]</f> his garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and <f>ⓘ</f>do not be faithless.”
2-17 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> You have wearied the LORD with your words. <f>ⓚ</f>But you say, “How have we wearied him?” <f>ⓛ</f>By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delights in them.” Or by asking, <f>ⓜ</f>“Where is the God of justice?”
