7-1 <pb/>But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for <f>ⓐ</f>Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel.
7-2 <pb/>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near <f>ⓑ</f>Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.
7-3 And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not have all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are few.”
7-4 So about three thousand men went up there from the people. And <f>ⓒ</f>they fled before the men of Ai,
7-5 and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent. And the hearts of the people <f>ⓓ</f>melted and became as water.
7-6 <pb/>Then Joshua <f>ⓔ</f>tore his clothes and <f>ⓕ</f>fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they put <f>ⓖ</f>dust on their heads.
7-7 And Joshua said, “Alas, O Lord GOD, <f>ⓗ</f>why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!
7-8 O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!
7-9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and <f>ⓘ</f>cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?”
7-10 <pb/>The LORD said to Joshua, “Get up! Why have you fallen on your face?
7-11 Israel has sinned; they have <f>ⓙ</f>transgressed my covenant that I commanded them; they have taken some of the <f>ⓚ</f>devoted things; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings.
7-12 <f>ⓛ</f> Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They <f>ⓜ</f>turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become <f>ⓝ</f>devoted for destruction. <f>[1]</f> I will be with you no more, unless you destroy <f>ⓞ</f>the devoted things from among you.
7-13 Get up! Consecrate the people and say, <f>ⓟ</f>‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, God of Israel, “There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you.”
7-14 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near <f>ⓠ</f>by your tribes. And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near by households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by man.
7-15 <f>ⓡ</f> And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has <f>ⓢ</f>transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done <f>ⓣ</f>an outrageous thing in Israel.’”
7-16 <pb/>So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
7-17 And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the <f>ⓤ</f>Zerahites was taken. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
7-18 And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
7-19 Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, <f>ⓥ</f>give glory to the LORD God of Israel and <f>ⓦ</f>give praise <f>[2]</f> to him. And <f>ⓧ</f>tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.”
7-20 And Achan answered Joshua, “Truly <f>ⓨ</f>I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did:
7-21 when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar, and 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels, <f>[3]</f> then I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”
7-22 <pb/>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
7-23 And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel. And they laid them down before the LORD.
7-24 And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had. And they brought them up to the <f>ⓩ</f>Valley of Achor.
7-25 And Joshua said, “Why did you <f>ⓐ</f>bring trouble on us? The LORD brings trouble on you today.” And all Israel <f>ⓑ</f>stoned him with stones. <f>ⓒ</f>They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.
7-26 And they raised over him <f>ⓓ</f>a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore, to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor. <f>[4]</f>
81-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f> <pb/><t><f>ⓒ</f> Sing aloud to God our strength; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>shout for joy to the God of Jacob!</t>
81-2 <t>Raise a song; sound <f>ⓔ</f>the tambourine, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>the sweet lyre with <f>ⓖ</f>the harp.</t>
81-3 <t>Blow the trumpet at <f>ⓗ</f>the new moon, </t><t>at the full moon, on our feast day. </t>
81-4 <pb/><t>For it is a statute for Israel, </t><t>a rule <f>[2]</f> of the God of Jacob.</t>
81-5 <t>He made it <f>ⓘ</f>a decree in <f>ⓙ</f>Joseph </t><t>when he <f>ⓚ</f>went out over <f>[3]</f> the land of Egypt. </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>I hear a language <f>ⓜ</f>I had not known:</t>
81-6 <t>“I <f>ⓝ</f>relieved your <f>[4]</f> shoulder of <f>ⓞ</f>the burden; </t><t>your hands were freed from the basket.</t>
81-7 <t>In distress you <f>ⓟ</f>called, and I delivered you; </t><t>I <f>ⓠ</f>answered you in the secret place of thunder; </t><t>I <f>ⓡ</f>tested you at the waters of Meribah. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
81-8 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! </t><t>O Israel, if you would but listen to me!</t>
81-9 <t>There shall be no <f>ⓣ</f>strange god among you; </t><t>you shall not bow down to a <f>ⓤ</f>foreign god.</t>
81-10 <t><f>ⓥ</f> I am the LORD your God, </t><t>who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. </t>
81-11 <pb/><t>“But my people did not listen to my voice; </t><t>Israel <f>ⓧ</f>would not submit to me.</t>
81-12 <t>So I <f>ⓨ</f>gave them over to their <f>ⓩ</f>stubborn hearts, </t><t>to follow their own <f>ⓐ</f>counsels.</t>
81-13 <t><f>ⓑ</f> Oh, that my people would listen to me, </t><t>that Israel would <f>ⓒ</f>walk in my ways!</t>
81-14 <t>I would soon subdue their enemies </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>turn my hand against their foes.</t>
81-15 <t>Those who hate the LORD would <f>ⓔ</f>cringe toward him, </t><t>and their fate would last forever.</t>
81-16 <t>But he would feed you <f>[5]</f> with <f>ⓕ</f>the finest of the wheat, </t><t>and with <f>ⓖ</f>honey from the rock I would satisfy you.” </t>
13-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “On that day there shall be <f>ⓑ</f>a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness.
13-2 <pb/>“And <f>ⓒ</f>on that day, declares the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓓ</f>I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, so that <f>ⓔ</f>they shall be remembered no more. And also <f>ⓕ</f>I will remove from the land the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness.
13-3 And if anyone again prophesies, his father and mother who bore him will say to him, <f>ⓖ</f>‘You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the LORD.’ And his father and mother who bore him shall pierce him through when he prophesies.
13-4 <pb/>“On that day <f>ⓗ</f>every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies. He will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive,
13-5 but he will say, <f>ⓘ</f>‘I am no prophet, I am a worker of the soil, for a man sold me in my youth.’ <f>[1]</f>
13-6 And if one asks him, ‘What are these wounds on your back?’ <f>[2]</f> he will say, ‘The wounds I received in the house of my friends.’
13-7 <pb/><t>“Awake, O sword, against <f>ⓙ</f>my shepherd, </t><t>against the man who stands next to me,” <pb/>declares the LORD of hosts. </t> <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f>“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; </t><t>I will turn my hand against the little ones.</t>
13-8 <t>In the whole land, declares the LORD, </t><t>two thirds shall be cut off and perish, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>and one third shall be left alive.</t>
13-9 <t>And <f>ⓜ</f>I will put this third into the fire, </t><t>and refine them as one refines silver, </t><t>and test them as gold is tested. </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>They will call upon my name, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>I will answer them. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>I will say, ‘They are my people’; </t><t>and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’” </t>
