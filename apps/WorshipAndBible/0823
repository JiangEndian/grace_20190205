27-1 <pb/>Now Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, “Keep the whole commandment that I command you today.
27-2 And on the day <f>ⓐ</f>you cross over the Jordan to the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall set up large stones and plaster them with plaster.
27-3 <f>ⓑ</f> And you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you cross over to enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, <f>ⓒ</f>a land flowing with milk and honey, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
27-4 And when you have crossed over the Jordan, you shall set up these stones, concerning which I command you today, <f>ⓓ</f>on Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
27-5 And there you shall build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. <f>ⓔ</f>You shall wield no iron tool on them;
27-6 you shall build an altar to the LORD your God of uncut <f>[1]</f> stones. And you shall offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God,
27-7 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and <f>ⓕ</f>shall eat there, and you <f>ⓖ</f>shall rejoice before the LORD your God.
27-8 And <f>ⓗ</f>you shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.”
27-9 <pb/>Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, “Keep silence and hear, O Israel: <f>ⓘ</f>this day you have become the people of the LORD your God.
27-10 You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God, keeping his commandments and his statutes, which I command you today.”
27-11 <pb/>That day Moses charged the people, saying,
27-12 “When you have crossed over the Jordan, <f>ⓙ</f>these shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
27-13 And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
27-14 And <f>ⓚ</f>the Levites shall declare to all the men of Israel in a loud voice:
27-15 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “‘Cursed be the man who makes a carved or cast metal image, an abomination to the LORD, a thing made by the hands of a craftsman, and sets it up in secret.’ <f>ⓜ</f>And all the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen.’
27-16 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who dishonors his father or his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-17 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who moves his neighbor's landmark.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-18 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who misleads a blind man on the road.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-19 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who perverts the justice due to the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-20 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who lies with his father's wife, because he has <f>ⓢ</f>uncovered his father's nakedness.’ <f>[2]</f> And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-21 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who lies with any kind of animal.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-22 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who lies with his sister, whether the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-23 <pb/><f>ⓥ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who lies with his mother-in-law.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-24 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who strikes down his neighbor in secret.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-25 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who takes a bribe to shed innocent blood.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
27-26 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> “‘Cursed be anyone who does not confirm the words of this law by doing them.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’

1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to <f>ⓑ</f>Zerubbabel the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to <f>ⓓ</f>Joshua the son of <f>ⓔ</f>Jehozadak, the high priest:
1-2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD.”
1-3 Then the word of the LORD came <f>ⓕ</f>by the hand of Haggai the prophet,
1-4 <f>ⓖ</f> “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while <f>ⓗ</f>this house lies in ruins?
1-5 Now, therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓘ</f>Consider your ways.
1-6 <f>ⓙ</f> You have sown much, and harvested little. <f>ⓚ</f>You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who <f>ⓛ</f>earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.
1-7 <pb/>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓜ</f>Consider your ways.
1-8 Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that <f>ⓝ</f>I may take pleasure in it and that <f>ⓞ</f>I may be glorified, says the LORD.
1-9 <f>ⓟ</f> You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, <f>ⓠ</f>I blew it away. Why? declares the LORD of hosts. Because of my house <f>ⓡ</f>that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house.
1-10 Therefore <f>ⓢ</f>the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.
1-11 And <f>ⓣ</f>I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on <f>ⓤ</f>the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and <f>ⓥ</f>on all their labors.”
1-12 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Then <f>ⓧ</f>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and <f>ⓨ</f>Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all <f>ⓩ</f>the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people feared the LORD.
1-13 Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke to the people with the LORD's message, <f>ⓐ</f>“I am with you, declares the LORD.”
1-14 And <f>ⓑ</f>the LORD stirred up the spirit of <f>ⓒ</f>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of <f>ⓓ</f>Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all <f>ⓔ</f>the remnant of the people. And they came and <f>ⓕ</f>worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,
1-15 <f>ⓖ</f> on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
