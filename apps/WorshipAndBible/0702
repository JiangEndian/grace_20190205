Numbers 11-1 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>the people complained in the hearing of the LORD about their misfortunes, and when the LORD heard it, <f>ⓑ</f>his anger was kindled, and <f>ⓒ</f>the fire of the LORD burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.
Numbers 11-2 Then <f>ⓓ</f>the people cried out to Moses, <f>ⓔ</f>and Moses prayed to the LORD, and the fire died down.
Numbers 11-3 So the name of that place was called <f>ⓕ</f>Taberah, <f>[1]</f> because the fire of the LORD burned among them.
Numbers 11-4 <pb/>Now the <f>ⓖ</f>rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel also <f>ⓗ</f>wept again and said, <f>ⓘ</f>“Oh that we had meat to eat!
Numbers 11-5 <f>ⓙ</f> We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
Numbers 11-6 But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.”
Numbers 11-7 <pb/>Now <f>ⓚ</f>the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.
Numbers 11-8 <f>ⓛ</f> The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. <f>ⓜ</f>And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.
Numbers 11-9 <f>ⓝ</f> When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.
Numbers 11-10 <pb/>Moses heard the people <f>ⓞ</f>weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the LORD blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased.
Numbers 11-11 <f>ⓟ</f> Moses said to the LORD, “Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
Numbers 11-12 Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Carry them in your bosom, as a <f>ⓡ</f>nurse carries a nursing child,’ to the land <f>ⓢ</f>that you swore to give their fathers?
Numbers 11-13 <f>ⓣ</f> Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’
Numbers 11-14 <f>ⓤ</f> I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.
Numbers 11-15 If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.”
Numbers 11-16 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Gather for me <f>ⓥ</f>seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and <f>ⓦ</f>officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.
Numbers 11-17 <f>ⓧ</f> And I will come down and talk with you there. And <f>ⓨ</f>I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and <f>ⓩ</f>they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone.
Numbers 11-18 And say to the people, <f>ⓐ</f>‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? <f>ⓑ</f>For it was better for us in Egypt.” Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat.
Numbers 11-19 You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,
Numbers 11-20 but a whole month, <f>ⓒ</f>until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you and have wept before him, saying, <f>ⓓ</f>“Why did we come out of Egypt?”’”
Numbers 11-21 But Moses said, <f>ⓔ</f>“The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!’
Numbers 11-22 <f>ⓕ</f> Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and be enough for them?”
Numbers 11-23 And the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓖ</f>“Is the LORD's hand shortened? Now you shall see whether <f>ⓗ</f>my word will come true for you or not.”
Numbers 11-24 <pb/>So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD. <f>ⓘ</f>And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent.
Numbers 11-25 Then <f>ⓙ</f>the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.
Numbers 11-26 <pb/>Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they <f>ⓚ</f>had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.
Numbers 11-27 And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
Numbers 11-28 And <f>ⓛ</f>Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, “My lord Moses, <f>ⓜ</f>stop them.”
Numbers 11-29 But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? <f>ⓝ</f>Would that all the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!”
Numbers 11-30 And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
Numbers 11-31 <pb/>Then a <f>ⓞ</f>wind from the LORD sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits <f>[2]</f> above the ground.
Numbers 11-32 And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten <f>ⓟ</f>homers. <f>[3]</f> And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
Numbers 11-33 <f>ⓠ</f> While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and <f>ⓡ</f>the LORD struck down the people with a very great plague.
Numbers 11-34 Therefore the name of that place was called <f>ⓢ</f>Kibroth-hattaavah, <f>[4]</f> because there they buried the people who had the craving.
Numbers 11-35 <f>ⓣ</f> From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to <f>ⓤ</f>Hazeroth, and they remained at <f>ⓥ</f>Hazeroth.
Psalm 15-1 <pb/><t>O LORD, <f>ⓐ</f>who shall sojourn in your <f>ⓑ</f>tent? </t><t>Who shall dwell on your <f>ⓒ</f>holy hill? </t>
Psalm 15-2 <pb/><t>He who <f>ⓓ</f>walks blamelessly and <f>ⓔ</f>does what is right </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>speaks truth in his heart;</t>
Psalm 15-3 <t>who <f>ⓖ</f>does not slander with his tongue </t><t>and does no evil to his neighbor, </t><t>nor <f>ⓗ</f>takes up a reproach against his friend;</t>
Psalm 15-4 <t><f>ⓘ</f> in whose eyes a vile person is despised, </t><t>but who honors those who fear the LORD; </t><t>who <f>ⓙ</f>swears to his own hurt and does not change;</t>
Psalm 15-5 <t>who <f>ⓚ</f>does not put out his money at interest </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>does not take a bribe against the innocent. </t><t>He who does these things shall never be <f>ⓜ</f>moved. </t>
Daniel 8-1 <pb/>In the third year of the reign of <f>ⓐ</f>King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, <f>ⓑ</f>after that which appeared to me <f>ⓒ</f>at the first.
Daniel 8-2 And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in <f>ⓓ</f>Susa the citadel, which is in the province of <f>ⓔ</f>Elam. And <f>ⓕ</f>I saw in the vision, <f>ⓖ</f>and I was at the <f>ⓗ</f>Ulai canal.
Daniel 8-3 I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, <f>ⓘ</f>a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
Daniel 8-4 I saw <f>ⓙ</f>the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No <f>ⓚ</f>beast <f>ⓛ</f>could stand before him, <f>ⓜ</f>and there was no one who could rescue from his power. <f>ⓝ</f>He did as he pleased and <f>ⓞ</f>became great.
Daniel 8-5 <pb/>As I was considering, behold, a <f>ⓟ</f>male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had <f>ⓠ</f>a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
Daniel 8-6 He came to <f>ⓡ</f>the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, <f>ⓢ</f>and he ran at him in his powerful wrath.
Daniel 8-7 I saw him come close to the ram, <f>ⓣ</f>and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. <f>ⓤ</f>And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he <f>ⓥ</f>cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power.
Daniel 8-8 Then <f>ⓦ</f>the goat <f>ⓧ</f>became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four <f>ⓨ</f>conspicuous horns toward <f>ⓩ</f>the four winds of heaven.
Daniel 8-9 <pb/>Out of one of them came <f>ⓐ</f>a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward <f>ⓑ</f>the south, toward the east, and toward <f>ⓒ</f>the glorious land.
Daniel 8-10 <f>ⓓ</f> It grew great, <f>ⓔ</f>even to the host of heaven. And some of the host <f>ⓕ</f>and some <f>[1]</f> of <f>ⓖ</f>the stars it threw down to the ground and <f>ⓗ</f>trampled on them.
Daniel 8-11 <f>ⓘ</f> It became great, even as great as <f>ⓙ</f>the Prince of the host. <f>ⓚ</f>And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.
Daniel 8-12 And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression, <f>[2]</f> and it will throw truth to the ground, and <f>ⓛ</f>it will act and prosper.
Daniel 8-13 Then I heard <f>ⓜ</f>a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, <f>ⓝ</f>“For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, <f>ⓞ</f>the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?”
Daniel 8-14 And he said to me, <f>[3]</f> “For 2,300 <f>ⓟ</f>evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.”
Daniel 8-15 <pb/>When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I <f>ⓠ</f>sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having <f>ⓡ</f>the appearance of a man.
Daniel 8-16 <f>ⓢ</f> And I heard a man's voice <f>ⓣ</f>between the banks of the <f>ⓤ</f>Ulai, and it called, <f>ⓥ</f>“Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”
Daniel 8-17 So he came near where I stood. And when he came, <f>ⓦ</f>I was frightened <f>ⓧ</f>and fell on my face. But he said to me, “Understand, <f>ⓨ</f>O son of man, that the vision is for <f>ⓩ</f>the time of the end.”
Daniel 8-18 <pb/>And when he had spoken to me, <f>ⓐ</f>I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But <f>ⓑ</f>he touched me and made me stand up.
Daniel 8-19 He said, “Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of <f>ⓒ</f>the indignation, for it refers to <f>ⓓ</f>the appointed time of the end.
Daniel 8-20 As for <f>ⓔ</f>the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of <f>ⓕ</f>Media and Persia.
Daniel 8-21 And <f>ⓖ</f>the goat <f>[4]</f> is the king of Greece. And <f>ⓗ</f>the great horn between his eyes is <f>ⓘ</f>the first king.
Daniel 8-22 <f>ⓙ</f> As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his <f>[5]</f> nation, <f>ⓚ</f>but not with his power.
Daniel 8-23 And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise.
Daniel 8-24 His power shall be great — <f>ⓛ</f>but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction <f>ⓜ</f>and shall succeed in what he does, <f>ⓝ</f>and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints.
Daniel 8-25 <f>ⓞ</f> By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind <f>ⓟ</f>he shall become great. <f>ⓠ</f>Without warning he shall destroy many. And he <f>ⓡ</f>shall even rise up against the Prince of princes, and he shall be broken — but <f>ⓢ</f>by no human hand.
Daniel 8-26 The vision of <f>ⓣ</f>the evenings and the mornings that has been told <f>ⓤ</f>is true, but <f>ⓥ</f>seal up the vision, <f>ⓦ</f>for it refers to many days from now.”
Daniel 8-27 <pb/>And <f>ⓧ</f>I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days. Then I rose and went about the king's business, but I was appalled by the vision <f>ⓨ</f>and did not understand it.
