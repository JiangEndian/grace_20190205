Esther 4-3 And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, <f>ⓑ</f>with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and many of them <f>ⓒ</f>lay in sackcloth and ashes.
Esther 4-4 <pb/>When Esther's young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
Esther 4-5 Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was.
Esther 4-6 Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate,
Esther 4-7 and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, <f>ⓓ</f>and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.

Esther 4-9 And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said.
Esther 4-10 Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say,
Esther 4-11 “All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside <f>ⓕ</f>the inner court without being called, <f>ⓖ</f>there is but one law — to be put to death, except the one <f>ⓗ</f>to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live.

Esther 4-12 <pb/>And they told Mordecai what Esther had said.
Esther 4-13 Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, “Do not think to yourself that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.
Esther 4-14 For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”
Esther 4-15 Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,
Esther 4-16 “Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and do not eat or drink for <f>ⓘ</f>three days, night or day. I and my young women will also fast as you do.

1 John 2-1 <pb/>My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, <f>ⓐ</f>we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
1 John 2-2 <f>ⓑ</f> He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but <f>ⓒ</f>also for the sins of the whole world.
1 John 2-3 And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we <f>ⓓ</f>keep his commandments.
1 John 2-4 Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments <f>ⓔ</f>is a liar, and <f>ⓕ</f>the truth is not in him,
1 John 2-5 but whoever <f>ⓖ</f>keeps his word, in him truly <f>ⓗ</f>the love of God is perfected. <f>ⓘ</f>By this we may know that we are in him:
1 John 2-6 whoever says he <f>ⓙ</f>abides in him <f>ⓚ</f>ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.
1 John 2-7 <pb/>Beloved, I am writing you <f>ⓛ</f>no new commandment, but <f>ⓜ</f>an old commandment <f>ⓝ</f>that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard.

1 John 2-10 Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him <f>[2]</f> there is no <f>ⓢ</f>cause for stumbling.
1 John 2-11 But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and <f>ⓣ</f>walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

1 John 2-22 Who is the liar but <f>ⓟ</f>he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is <f>ⓠ</f>the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.
1 John 2-23 <f>ⓡ</f> No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.
1 John 2-24 Let <f>ⓢ</f>what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then <f>ⓣ</f>you too will abide in the Son and in the Father.
1 John 2-25 And this is the promise that he made to us <f>[5]</f> — <f>ⓤ</f>eternal life.
1 John 2-26 <pb/>I write these things to you about <f>ⓥ</f>those who are trying to deceive you.
1 John 2-27 But <f>ⓦ</f>the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and <f>ⓧ</f>you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and <f>ⓨ</f>is true, and is no lie — just as it has taught you, abide in him.
1 John 2-28 <pb/>And now, little children, abide in him, so that <f>ⓩ</f>when he appears <f>ⓐ</f>we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his <f>ⓑ</f>coming.
1 John 2-29 If you know that <f>ⓒ</f>he is righteous, you may be sure that <f>ⓓ</f>everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.
