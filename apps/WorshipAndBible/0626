5-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
5-2 “Command the people of Israel that they <f>ⓐ</f>put out of the camp everyone who is leprous <f>[1]</f> or has <f>ⓑ</f>a discharge and everyone who is <f>ⓒ</f>unclean through contact with the dead.
5-3 You shall put out both male and female, putting them outside the camp, that they may not defile their camp, <f>ⓓ</f>in the midst of which I dwell.”
5-4 And the people of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp; as the LORD said to Moses, so the people of Israel did.
5-5 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
5-6 “Speak to the people of Israel, <f>ⓔ</f>When a man or woman commits any of the sins that people commit by breaking faith with the LORD, and that person realizes his guilt,
5-7 <f>ⓕ</f> he shall confess his sin that he has committed. <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓖ</f>And he shall make full restitution for his wrong, adding a fifth to it and giving it to him to whom he did the wrong.
5-8 But if the man has no next of kin to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for wrong shall go to the LORD for the priest, in addition to <f>ⓗ</f>the ram of atonement with which atonement is made for him.
5-9 And <f>ⓘ</f>every contribution, all the holy donations of the people of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.
5-10 Each one shall keep his holy donations: whatever anyone gives to the priest shall be his.”
5-11 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
5-12 “Speak to the people of Israel, If any man's wife goes astray and breaks faith with him,
5-13 if a man <f>ⓙ</f>lies with her sexually, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she is undetected though she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her, <f>ⓚ</f>since she was not taken in the act,
5-14 and if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife who has defiled herself, or if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife, though she has not defiled herself,
5-15 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest and bring the offering required of her, a tenth of an ephah <f>[3]</f> of barley flour. <f>ⓛ</f>He shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, <f>ⓜ</f>bringing iniquity to remembrance.
5-16 <pb/>“And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the LORD.
5-17 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
5-18 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD and <f>ⓝ</f>unbind the hair of the woman's head and place in her hands the grain offering of remembrance, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And in his hand the priest shall have the water of bitterness that brings the curse.
5-19 Then the priest shall make her take an oath, saying, ‘If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while you were under your husband's authority, be free from this water of bitterness that brings the curse.
5-20 But if you have gone astray, though you are under your husband's authority, and if you have defiled yourself, and some man other than your husband has lain with you,
5-21 then’ (let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse, and say to the woman) <f>ⓞ</f>‘the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD makes your thigh fall away and your body swell.
5-22 May this water that brings the curse <f>ⓟ</f>pass into your bowels and make your womb swell and your thigh fall away.’ And the woman shall say, <f>ⓠ</f>‘Amen, Amen.’
5-23 <pb/>“Then the priest shall write these curses in a book and wash them off into the water of bitterness.
5-24 And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain.
5-25 And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand <f>ⓡ</f>and shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and bring it to the altar.
5-26 And the priest <f>ⓢ</f>shall take a handful of the grain offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
5-27 And when he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has broken faith with her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman <f>ⓣ</f>shall become a curse among her people.
5-28 But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.
5-29 <pb/>“This is the law in cases of jealousy, when a wife, <f>ⓤ</f>though under her husband's authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
5-30 or when the spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife. Then he shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall carry out for her all this law.
5-31 The man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman <f>ⓥ</f>shall bear her iniquity.”
9-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>[2]</f>  <pb/><t>I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; </t><t>I will recount all of your <f>ⓐ</f>wonderful deeds.</t>
9-2 <t>I will be glad and <f>ⓑ</f>exult in you; </t><t>I will <f>ⓒ</f>sing praise to your name, <f>ⓓ</f>O Most High. </t>

9-6 <t>The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins; </t><t>their cities you rooted out; </t><t>the very memory of them has perished. </t>
9-7 <pb/><t>But the LORD sits enthroned forever; </t><t>he has established his throne for justice,</t>

9-9 <pb/><t>The LORD is <f>ⓚ</f>a stronghold for <f>ⓛ</f>the oppressed, </t><t>a stronghold in <f>ⓜ</f>times of trouble.</t>
9-10 <t>And those who <f>ⓝ</f>know your name put their trust in you, </t><t>for you, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you. </t>

9-15 <pb/><t>The nations have sunk in <f>ⓦ</f>the pit that they made; </t><t>in <f>ⓧ</f>the net that they hid, their own foot has been caught.</t>
9-16 <t>The LORD has made himself <f>ⓨ</f>known; he has executed judgment; </t><t>the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. <pb/><i>Higgaion. <f>[4]</f> Selah</i> <pb/></t>

2-1 <pb/>In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; <f>ⓐ</f>his spirit was troubled, and <f>ⓑ</f>his sleep left him.
2-2 Then the king commanded that <f>ⓒ</f>the magicians, <f>ⓓ</f>the enchanters, the <f>ⓔ</f>sorcerers, and <f>ⓕ</f>the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and <f>ⓖ</f>stood before the king.
2-3 And the king said to them, “I had a dream, and <f>ⓗ</f>my spirit is troubled to know the dream.”
2-4 Then <f>ⓘ</f>the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓙ</f>“O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.”
2-5 The king answered and said to <f>ⓚ</f>the Chaldeans, “The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be <f>ⓛ</f>torn limb from limb, <f>ⓜ</f>and your <f>ⓝ</f>houses shall be laid in ruins.
2-6 But if you show the dream and its interpretation, <f>ⓞ</f>you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. <f>ⓟ</f>Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.”
2-7 They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation.”
2-8 The king answered and said, “I know with certainty that you are trying to <f>ⓠ</f>gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm —
2-9 if you do not make the dream known to me, <f>ⓡ</f>there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till <f>ⓢ</f>the times change. <f>ⓣ</f>Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation.”
2-10 <f>ⓤ</f> The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or <f>ⓥ</f>Chaldean.
2-11 The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except <f>ⓦ</f>the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”
2-12 <pb/>Because of this the king was angry and <f>ⓧ</f>very furious, and <f>ⓨ</f>commanded that all <f>ⓩ</f>the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.
2-13 So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought <f>ⓐ</f>Daniel and his companions, to kill them.
2-14 Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to <f>ⓑ</f>Arioch, the <f>ⓒ</f>captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.
2-15 He declared <f>[2]</f> to Arioch, the king's captain, “Why is the decree of the king <f>ⓓ</f>so urgent?” Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel.
2-16 And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king.
2-17 <pb/>Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to <f>ⓔ</f>Hananiah, <f>ⓕ</f>Mishael, and <f>ⓖ</f>Azariah, his companions,
2-18 <f>ⓗ</f> and told them to seek mercy from the <f>ⓘ</f>God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not <f>ⓙ</f>be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
2-19 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in <f>ⓚ</f>a vision of the night. Then Daniel <f>ⓛ</f>blessed the <f>ⓜ</f>God of heaven.
2-20 Daniel answered and said: <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f>“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>to whom belong wisdom and might.</t>
2-21 <t><f>ⓟ</f> He changes times and seasons; </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>he removes kings and sets up kings; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>he gives wisdom to the wise </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>and knowledge to those who have understanding;</t>
2-22 <t><f>ⓣ</f> he reveals deep and hidden things; </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>he knows what is in the darkness, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>and the light dwells with him.</t>
2-23 <t>To you, O <f>ⓦ</f>God of my fathers, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>I give thanks and praise, </t><t>for <f>ⓨ</f>you have given me wisdom and might, </t><t>and have now made known to me what <f>ⓩ</f>we asked of you, </t><t>for you have made known to us the king's matter.” </t>
2-24 <pb/>Therefore Daniel went in to <f>ⓐ</f>Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: “Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation.”
2-25 <pb/>Then <f>ⓑ</f>Arioch brought in Daniel before the king <f>ⓒ</f>in haste and said thus to him: “I have found <f>ⓓ</f>among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation.”
2-26 The king declared to Daniel, <f>ⓔ</f>whose name was Belteshazzar, <f>ⓕ</f>“Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?”
2-27 Daniel answered the king and said, “No wise men, <f>ⓖ</f>enchanters, <f>ⓗ</f>magicians, or <f>ⓘ</f>astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked,
2-28 but <f>ⓙ</f>there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar <f>ⓚ</f>what will be in the latter days. Your dream and <f>ⓛ</f>the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these:
2-29 To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, <f>ⓜ</f>and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be.
2-30 But <f>ⓝ</f>as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that <f>ⓞ</f>you may know the thoughts of your mind.
2-31 <pb/>“You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening.
2-32 <f>ⓟ</f> The head of this image was of fine gold, <f>ⓠ</f>its chest and arms of silver, its middle and <f>ⓡ</f>thighs of bronze,
2-33 <f>ⓢ</f> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
2-34 As you looked, a stone was cut out <f>ⓣ</f>by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and <f>ⓤ</f>broke them in pieces.
2-35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became <f>ⓥ</f>like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that <f>ⓦ</f>not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became <f>ⓧ</f>a great mountain <f>ⓨ</f>and filled the whole earth.
2-36 <pb/>“This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation.
2-37 You, O king, <f>ⓩ</f>the king of kings, to whom <f>ⓐ</f>the God of heaven <f>ⓑ</f>has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory,
2-38 and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, <f>ⓒ</f>the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all — you are <f>ⓓ</f>the head of gold.
2-39 <f>ⓔ</f> Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom <f>ⓕ</f>of bronze, <f>ⓖ</f>which shall rule over all the earth.
2-40 And <f>ⓗ</f>there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron <f>ⓘ</f>breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall <f>ⓙ</f>break and crush all these.
2-41 And as you saw <f>ⓚ</f>the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the <f>ⓛ</f>firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay.
2-42 And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.
2-43 As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, <f>[3]</f> but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.
2-44 And in the days of those kings <f>ⓜ</f>the God of heaven will set up <f>ⓝ</f>a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. <f>ⓞ</f>It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and <f>ⓟ</f>it shall stand forever,
2-45 just as <f>ⓠ</f>you saw that <f>ⓡ</f>a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that <f>ⓢ</f>it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A <f>ⓣ</f>great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.”
2-46 <pb/>Then King Nebuchadnezzar <f>ⓤ</f>fell upon his face and <f>ⓥ</f>paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that <f>ⓦ</f>an offering and <f>ⓧ</f>incense be offered up to him.
2-47 The king answered and said to Daniel, “Truly, your <f>ⓨ</f>God is God of gods and <f>ⓩ</f>Lord of kings, and <f>ⓐ</f>a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.”
2-48 Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great <f>ⓑ</f>gifts, and made him ruler over the whole <f>ⓒ</f>province of Babylon and <f>ⓓ</f>chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
2-49 Daniel made a request of the king, and he <f>ⓔ</f>appointed <f>ⓕ</f>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of <f>ⓖ</f>the province of Babylon. But Daniel <f>ⓗ</f>remained at the king's court.
