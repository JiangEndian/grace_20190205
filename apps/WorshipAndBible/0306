10-1 <pb/>These are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
10-2 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
10-3 The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
10-4 The sons of Javan: Elishah, <f>ⓑ</f>Tarshish, <f>ⓒ</f>Kittim, and Dodanim.
10-5 From these <f>ⓓ</f>the coastland peoples spread in their lands, each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.
10-6 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
10-7 The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
10-8 Cush fathered Nimrod; he was the first on earth to be a mighty man. <f>[1]</f>
10-9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.”
10-10 The beginning of his kingdom was <f>ⓕ</f>Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in <f>ⓖ</f>the land of Shinar.
10-11 From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah, and
10-12 Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
10-13 <f>ⓗ</f> Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
10-14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom <f>[2]</f> the Philistines came), and <f>ⓘ</f>Caphtorim.
10-15 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth,
10-16 and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
10-17 the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
10-18 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the clans of the Canaanites dispersed.
10-19 And the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon in the direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, and in the direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
10-20 These are the sons of Ham, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
10-21 <pb/>To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born.
10-22 The <f>ⓚ</f>sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
10-23 The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
10-24 Arpachshad fathered <f>ⓛ</f>Shelah; and Shelah fathered Eber.
10-25 <f>ⓜ</f> To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, <f>[3]</f> for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.
10-26 Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
10-27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
10-28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
10-29 <f>ⓝ</f> Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
10-30 The territory in which they lived extended from Mesha in the direction of Sephar to the hill country of the east.
10-31 These are the sons of Shem, by their clans, their languages, their lands, and their nations.
10-32 <pb/>These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies, in their nations, <f>ⓞ</f>and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth after the flood.
8-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house,
8-2 Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them.
8-3 <pb/>And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and took it.
8-4 He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath.
8-5 He also built <f>ⓑ</f>Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, <f>ⓒ</f>fortified cities <f>ⓓ</f>with walls, gates, and bars,
8-6 and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
8-7 <f>ⓔ</f> All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,
8-8 from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed — these Solomon drafted <f>ⓕ</f>as forced labor, and so they are to this day.
8-9 But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.
8-10 And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250, who exercised authority over the people.
8-11 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy.”
8-12 <pb/>Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD <f>ⓗ</f>that he had built before the vestibule,
8-13 <f>ⓘ</f> as the duty of each day required, offering <f>ⓙ</f>according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the <f>ⓚ</f>three annual feasts — the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.
8-14 According to the ruling of David his father, he appointed <f>ⓛ</f>the divisions of the priests for their service, <f>ⓜ</f>and the Levites for their offices of praise and <f>ⓝ</f>ministry before the priests <f>ⓞ</f>as the duty of each day required, and <f>ⓟ</f>the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate, for so David <f>ⓠ</f>the man of God had commanded.
8-15 And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.
8-16 <pb/>Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from <f>[1]</f> the day the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
8-17 <pb/>Then Solomon went to <f>ⓡ</f>Ezion-geber and <f>ⓢ</f>Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom.
8-18 And Hiram sent to him by the hand of his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon and brought from there <f>ⓣ</f>450 talents <f>[2]</f> of gold and brought it to King Solomon.
61-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, </t><t>because the LORD has <f>ⓑ</f>anointed me </t><t>to bring good news to the poor; <f>[1]</f> </t><t>he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, </t><t>to proclaim liberty to the captives, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>the opening of the prison to those who are bound; <f>[2]</f></t>
61-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor, </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>and the day of vengeance of our God; </t><t>to comfort all who mourn;</t>
61-3 <t>to grant to those who mourn in Zion — </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the oil of gladness instead of mourning, </t><t>the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>that they may be called oaks of righteousness, </t><t>the planting of the LORD, <f>ⓘ</f>that he may be glorified. <f>[3]</f></t>
61-4 <t><f>ⓙ</f> They shall build up the ancient ruins; </t><t>they shall raise up the former devastations; </t><t>they shall repair the ruined cities, </t><t>the devastations of many generations. </t>
61-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks; </t><t>foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;</t>
61-6 <t><f>ⓛ</f> but you shall be called the priests of the LORD; </t><t>they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>you shall eat the wealth of the nations, </t><t>and in their glory you shall boast.</t>
61-7 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion; </t><t>instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot; </t><t>therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion; </t><t>they shall have everlasting joy. </t>
61-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> For I the LORD love justice; </t><t>I hate robbery and wrong; <f>[4]</f> </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>I will faithfully give them their recompense, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</t>
61-9 <t>Their offspring shall be known among the nations, </t><t>and their descendants in the midst of the peoples; </t><t>all who see them shall acknowledge them, </t><t>that they are an offspring the LORD has blessed. </t>
61-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓡ</f> I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; </t><t>my soul shall exult in my God, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; </t><t>he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, </t><t>as a bridegroom decks himself <f>ⓣ</f>like a priest with a beautiful headdress, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</t>
61-11 <t>For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, </t><t>and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up, </t><t>so the Lord GOD will cause <f>ⓥ</f>righteousness and praise </t><t>to sprout up before all the nations. </t>
3-1 <pb/>Finally, my brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>rejoice in the Lord. <f>ⓑ</f>To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.
3-2 <pb/>Look out for <f>ⓒ</f>the dogs, look out for <f>ⓓ</f>the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh.
3-3 For <f>ⓔ</f>we are the circumcision, <f>ⓕ</f>who worship <f>ⓖ</f>by the Spirit of God <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓗ</f>glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh —
3-4 <f>ⓘ</f> though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:
3-5 <f>ⓙ</f> circumcised on the eighth day, <f>ⓚ</f>of the people of Israel, <f>ⓛ</f>of the tribe of Benjamin, <f>ⓜ</f>a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, <f>ⓝ</f>a Pharisee;
3-6 <f>ⓞ</f> as to zeal, <f>ⓟ</f>a persecutor of the church; <f>ⓠ</f>as to righteousness under the law, <f>[3]</f> blameless.
3-7 But <f>ⓡ</f>whatever gain I had, <f>ⓢ</f>I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
3-8 Indeed, I count everything as loss because of <f>ⓣ</f>the surpassing worth of <f>ⓤ</f>knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I <f>ⓥ</f>have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ
3-9 and be found in him, not having <f>ⓦ</f>a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but <f>ⓧ</f>that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith —
3-10 <f>ⓨ</f> that I may know him and <f>ⓩ</f>the power of his resurrection, and <f>ⓐ</f>may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
3-11 that by any means possible I may <f>ⓑ</f>attain the resurrection from the dead.
3-12 <pb/>Not that I have already <f>ⓒ</f>obtained this or <f>ⓓ</f>am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
3-13 Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: <f>ⓔ</f>forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,
3-14 I press on toward the goal for <f>ⓕ</f>the prize of the upward <f>ⓖ</f>call of God in Christ Jesus.
3-15 Let those of us who are <f>ⓗ</f>mature think this way, and if in anything <f>ⓘ</f>you think otherwise, <f>ⓙ</f>God will reveal that also to you.
3-16 Only <f>ⓚ</f>let us hold true to what we have attained.
3-17 <pb/>Brothers, <f>ⓛ</f>join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk <f>ⓜ</f>according to the example you have in us.
3-18 For <f>ⓝ</f>many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you <f>ⓞ</f>even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.
3-19 <f>ⓟ</f> Their end is destruction, <f>ⓠ</f>their god is their belly, and <f>ⓡ</f>they glory in their shame, with <f>ⓢ</f>minds set on earthly things.
3-20 But <f>ⓣ</f>our citizenship is in heaven, and <f>ⓤ</f>from it we <f>ⓥ</f>await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
3-21 who will transform <f>ⓦ</f>our lowly body <f>ⓧ</f>to be like his glorious body, <f>ⓨ</f>by the power that enables him even <f>ⓩ</f>to subject all things to himself.
