5-1 <pb/>This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, <f>ⓐ</f>he made him in the likeness of God.
5-2 Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man <f>[1]</f> when they were created.
5-3 When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son in his own likeness, after his image, and <f>ⓑ</f>named him Seth.
5-4 <f>ⓒ</f> The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters.
5-5 Thus all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, <f>ⓓ</f>and he died.
5-6 <pb/>When Seth had lived 105 years, <f>ⓔ</f>he fathered Enosh.
5-7 Seth lived after he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
5-8 Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died.
5-9 <pb/>When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan.
5-10 Enosh lived after he fathered Kenan 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
5-11 Thus all the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died.
5-12 <pb/>When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel.
5-13 Kenan lived after he fathered Mahalalel 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
5-14 Thus all the days of Kenan were 910 years, and he died.
5-15 <pb/>When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he fathered Jared.
5-16 Mahalalel lived after he fathered Jared 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
5-17 Thus all the days of Mahalalel were 895 years, and he died.
5-18 <pb/>When Jared had lived 162 years, he fathered <f>ⓕ</f>Enoch.
5-19 Jared lived after he fathered Enoch 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
5-20 Thus all the days of Jared were 962 years, and he died.
5-21 <pb/>When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah.
5-22 Enoch <f>ⓖ</f>walked with God <f>[2]</f> after he fathered Methuselah 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
5-23 Thus all the days of Enoch were 365 years.
5-24 Enoch <f>ⓗ</f>walked with God, and he was not, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>for God took him.
5-25 <pb/>When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he fathered Lamech.
5-26 Methuselah lived after he fathered Lamech 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
5-27 Thus all the days of Methuselah were 969 years, and he died.
5-28 <pb/>When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son
5-29 and called his name Noah, saying, “Out of the ground <f>ⓙ</f>that the LORD has cursed, this one shall bring us relief <f>[4]</f> from our work and from the painful toil of our hands.”
5-30 Lamech lived after he fathered Noah 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
5-31 Thus all the days of Lamech were 777 years, and he died.
5-32 <pb/>After Noah was 500 years old, Noah fathered <f>ⓚ</f>Shem, Ham, and <f>ⓛ</f>Japheth.
3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem <f>ⓑ</f>on Mount Moriah, where the LORD <f>[1]</f> had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, <f>ⓒ</f>on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
3-2 He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
3-3 These are Solomon's <f>ⓓ</f>measurements <f>[2]</f> for building the house of God: <f>ⓔ</f>the length, in cubits <f>[3]</f> of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
3-4 The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, <f>[4]</f> and its height was 120 cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.
3-5 <f>ⓕ</f> The nave he lined with cypress and covered it with fine gold <f>ⓖ</f>and made palms and chains on it.
3-6 He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parvaim.
3-7 So he lined the house with gold — its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors — <f>ⓗ</f>and he carved cherubim on the walls.
3-8 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length, corresponding to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth was twenty cubits. He overlaid it with 600 talents <f>[5]</f> of fine gold.
3-9 The weight of gold for the nails was fifty shekels. <f>[6]</f> And he overlaid <f>ⓙ</f>the upper chambers with gold.
3-10 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of wood <f>[7]</f> and overlaid <f>[8]</f> them with gold.
3-11 The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of the one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub;
3-12 and of this cherub, one wing, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and the other wing, also of five cubits, was joined to the wing of the first cherub.
3-13 The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. The cherubim <f>[9]</f> stood on their feet, <f>ⓛ</f>facing the nave.
3-14 <f>ⓜ</f> And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and he worked cherubim on it.
3-15 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each.
3-16 He made chains like a necklace <f>[10]</f> and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.
3-17 <f>ⓞ</f> He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Boaz.
56-1 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t>“Keep justice, and do righteousness, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>for soon my salvation will come, </t><t>and my righteousness be revealed.</t>
56-2 <t>Blessed is the man who does this, </t><t>and the son of man who holds it fast, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>who keeps the Sabbath, not profaning it, </t><t>and keeps his hand from doing any evil.” </t>
56-3 <pb/><t>Let not <f>ⓒ</f>the foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, </t><t>“The LORD will surely separate me from his people”; </t><t>and let not the eunuch say, </t><t>“Behold, I am <f>ⓓ</f>a dry tree.”</t>
56-4 <t>For thus says the LORD: </t><t>“To the eunuchs <f>ⓔ</f>who keep my Sabbaths, </t><t>who choose the things that please me </t><t>and hold fast my covenant,</t>
56-5 <t><f>ⓕ</f> I will give in my house and within my walls </t><t>a <f>ⓖ</f>monument and a name </t><t>better than sons and daughters; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>I will give them an everlasting name </t><t>that shall not be cut off. </t>
56-6 <pb/><t>“And <f>ⓘ</f>the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD, </t><t>to minister to him, to love the name of the LORD, </t><t>and to be his servants, </t><t>everyone <f>ⓙ</f>who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it, </t><t>and holds fast my covenant — </t>
56-7 <t><f>ⓚ</f> these I will bring to <f>ⓛ</f>my holy mountain, </t><t>and make them joyful in my house of prayer; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>their burnt offerings and their sacrifices </t><t>will be accepted on my altar; </t><t>for <f>ⓝ</f>my house shall be called a house of prayer </t><t>for all peoples.”</t>
56-8 <t>The Lord GOD, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>“I will gather yet others to him </t><t>besides those already gathered.” </t>
56-9 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> All you beasts of the field, come to devour — </t><t>all you beasts in the forest.</t>
56-10 <t><f>ⓡ</f> His watchmen are blind; </t><t>they are all without knowledge; </t><t>they are all silent <f>ⓢ</f>dogs; </t><t>they cannot bark, </t><t>dreaming, lying down, </t><t>loving to slumber.</t>
56-11 <t><f>ⓣ</f> The dogs have a mighty appetite; </t><t>they never have enough. </t><t>But <f>ⓤ</f>they are shepherds who have no understanding; </t><t>they have all turned to their own way, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>each to his own gain, one and all.</t>
56-12 <t><f>ⓦ</f> “Come,” they say, “let me get wine; </t><t>let us fill ourselves with strong drink; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and tomorrow will be like this day, </t><t>great beyond measure.” </t>
4-1 <pb/>I therefore, <f>ⓐ</f>a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to <f>ⓑ</f>walk in a manner worthy of <f>ⓒ</f>the calling to which you have been called,
4-2 with all <f>ⓓ</f>humility and <f>ⓔ</f>gentleness, with <f>ⓕ</f>patience, <f>ⓖ</f>bearing with one another in love,
4-3 eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in <f>ⓗ</f>the bond of peace.
4-4 There is <f>ⓘ</f>one body and <f>ⓙ</f>one Spirit — just as you were called to the one <f>ⓚ</f>hope that belongs to your call —
4-5 <f>ⓛ</f> one Lord, <f>ⓜ</f>one faith, <f>ⓝ</f>one baptism,
4-6 <f>ⓞ</f> one God and Father of all, <f>ⓟ</f>who is over all and through all and in all.
4-7 But <f>ⓠ</f>grace was given <f>ⓡ</f>to each one of us <f>ⓢ</f>according to the measure of Christ's gift.
4-8 Therefore it says, <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“When he ascended on high <f>ⓤ</f>he led a host of captives, </t><t>and he gave gifts to men.” <f>[1]</f> </t>
4-9 <pb/>(<f>ⓥ</f>In saying, “He ascended,” what does it mean but that he had also descended into <f>ⓦ</f>the lower regions, the earth? <f>[2]</f>
4-10 He who descended is the one who also <f>ⓧ</f>ascended <f>ⓨ</f>far above all the heavens, that he might <f>ⓩ</f>fill all things.)
4-11 And <f>ⓐ</f>he gave the <f>ⓑ</f>apostles, the prophets, the <f>ⓒ</f>evangelists, the <f>ⓓ</f>shepherds <f>[3]</f> and teachers, <f>[4]</f>
4-12 <f>ⓔ</f> to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for <f>ⓕ</f>building up <f>ⓖ</f>the body of Christ,
4-13 until we all attain to <f>ⓗ</f>the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, <f>ⓘ</f>to mature manhood, <f>[5]</f> to the measure of the stature of <f>ⓙ</f>the fullness of Christ,
4-14 so that we may no longer be children, <f>ⓚ</f>tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in <f>ⓛ</f>deceitful schemes.
4-15 Rather, <f>ⓜ</f>speaking the truth in love, we are to <f>ⓝ</f>grow up in every way into him who is <f>ⓞ</f>the head, into Christ,
4-16 <f>ⓟ</f> from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, <f>ⓠ</f>when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.
4-17 <pb/>Now this I say and <f>ⓡ</f>testify in the Lord, <f>ⓢ</f>that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, <f>ⓣ</f>in the futility of their minds.
4-18 They <f>ⓤ</f>are darkened in their understanding, <f>ⓥ</f>alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to <f>ⓦ</f>their hardness of heart.
4-19 They <f>ⓧ</f>have become callous and <f>ⓨ</f>have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.
4-20 But that is not the way you <f>ⓩ</f>learned Christ! —
4-21 assuming that <f>ⓐ</f>you have heard about him and <f>ⓑ</f>were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,
4-22 to <f>ⓒ</f>put off <f>ⓓ</f>your old self, <f>[6]</f> which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through <f>ⓔ</f>deceitful desires,
4-23 and <f>ⓕ</f>to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,
4-24 and to put on <f>ⓖ</f>the new self, <f>ⓗ</f>created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
4-25 <pb/>Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you <f>ⓘ</f>speak the truth with his neighbor, for <f>ⓙ</f>we are members one of another.
4-26 <f>ⓚ</f> Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
4-27 and <f>ⓛ</f>give no opportunity to the devil.
4-28 Let the thief no longer steal, but rather <f>ⓜ</f>let him labor, <f>ⓝ</f>doing honest work with his own hands, so <f>ⓞ</f>that he may have something to share with anyone in need.
4-29 <f>ⓟ</f> Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give <f>ⓠ</f>grace to those who hear.
4-30 And <f>ⓡ</f>do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, <f>ⓢ</f>by whom you were sealed for the day of <f>ⓣ</f>redemption.
4-31 <f>ⓤ</f> Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
4-32 <f>ⓥ</f> Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, <f>ⓦ</f>forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
