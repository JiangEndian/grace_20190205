Genesis 48-1 <pb/>After this, Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Genesis 48-2 And it was told to Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed.
Genesis 48-3 And Jacob said to Joseph, <f>ⓐ</f>“God Almighty <f>[1]</f> appeared to me at <f>ⓑ</f>Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
Genesis 48-4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you <f>ⓒ</f>for an everlasting possession.’
Genesis 48-5 And now your <f>ⓓ</f>two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, <f>ⓔ</f>are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.
Genesis 48-6 And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
Genesis 48-7 As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow <f>ⓕ</f>Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance <f>[2]</f> to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”
Genesis 48-8 <pb/>When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, “Who are these?”
Genesis 48-9 Joseph said to his father, <f>ⓖ</f>“They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, please, that <f>ⓗ</f>I may bless them.”
Genesis 48-10 Now <f>ⓘ</f>the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, <f>ⓙ</f>and he kissed them and embraced them.
Genesis 48-11 And Israel said to Joseph, <f>ⓚ</f>“I never expected to see your face; and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.”
Genesis 48-12 Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
Genesis 48-13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him.
Genesis 48-14 <f>ⓛ</f> And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, <f>ⓜ</f>crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn).
Genesis 48-15 And he blessed Joseph and said, <pb/><t>“The God <f>ⓝ</f>before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, </t><t>the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,</t>
Genesis 48-16 <t><f>ⓞ</f> the angel who has <f>ⓟ</f>redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; </t><t>and in them let <f>ⓠ</f>my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; </t><t>and let them <f>ⓡ</f>grow into a multitude <f>[3]</f> in the midst of the earth.” </t>
Genesis 48-17 <pb/>When Joseph saw that his father <f>ⓢ</f>laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
Genesis 48-18 And Joseph said to his father, “Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head.”
Genesis 48-19 But his father refused and said, <f>ⓣ</f>“I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless, <f>ⓤ</f>his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude <f>[4]</f> of nations.”
Genesis 48-20 So he blessed them that day, saying, <pb/><t>“By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.’” </t> <pb/>Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
Genesis 48-21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but <f>ⓦ</f>God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.
Genesis 48-22 Moreover, I have given to <f>ⓧ</f>you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope <f>[5]</f> that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.”
Ezra 10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> While Ezra prayed and <f>ⓑ</f>made confession, weeping and <f>ⓒ</f>casting himself down <f>ⓓ</f>before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children, gathered to him out of Israel, for the people wept bitterly.
Ezra 10-2 And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra: <f>ⓔ</f>“We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.
Ezra 10-3 Therefore <f>ⓕ</f>let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and <f>ⓖ</f>their children, according to the counsel of my lord <f>[1]</f> and of <f>ⓗ</f>those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done <f>ⓘ</f>according to the Law.
Ezra 10-4 Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; <f>ⓙ</f>be strong and do it.”
Ezra 10-5 Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel <f>ⓚ</f>take an oath that they would do as had been said. So they took the oath.
Ezra 10-6 <pb/>Then Ezra withdrew <f>ⓛ</f>from before the house of God and went to the <f>ⓜ</f>chamber of <f>ⓝ</f>Jehohanan the son of <f>ⓞ</f>Eliashib, where he spent the night, <f>[2]</f> neither <f>ⓟ</f>eating bread nor drinking water, for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles.
Ezra 10-7 And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,
Ezra 10-8 and that if anyone did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited, and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles.
Ezra 10-9 <pb/>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the <f>ⓠ</f>heavy rain.
Ezra 10-10 And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have broken faith and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel.
Ezra 10-11 Now then <f>ⓡ</f>make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers and do his will. <f>ⓢ</f>Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.”
Ezra 10-12 Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, “It is so; we must do as you have said.
Ezra 10-13 But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a task for one day or for two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
Ezra 10-14 Let our officials stand for the whole assembly. Let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come <f>ⓣ</f>at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every city, <f>ⓤ</f>until the fierce wrath of our God over this matter is turned away from us.”
Ezra 10-15 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and <f>ⓥ</f>Meshullam and <f>ⓦ</f>Shabbethai the Levite supported them.
Ezra 10-16 <pb/>Then the returned exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men, <f>[3]</f> heads of fathers' houses, according to their fathers' houses, each of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter;
Ezra 10-17 and by the first day of the first month they had come to the end of all the men who had married foreign women.
Ezra 10-18 <pb/>Now there were found some of the sons of the priests who had married foreign women: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah, some of the sons of <f>ⓧ</f>Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers.
Ezra 10-19 They <f>ⓨ</f>pledged themselves to put away their wives, and their guilt offering was <f>ⓩ</f>a ram of the flock for their guilt. <f>[4]</f>
Ezra 10-20 <f>ⓐ</f> Of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.

Ezra 10-44 All these had married foreign women, and some of the women <f>ⓔ</f>had even borne children. <f>[7]</f>
Jeremiah 33-1 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still <f>ⓐ</f>shut up in the court of the guard:
Jeremiah 33-2 “Thus says <f>ⓑ</f>the LORD who made the earth, <f>[1]</f> the LORD who formed it to establish it — <f>ⓒ</f>the LORD is his name:
Jeremiah 33-3 <f>ⓓ</f> Call to me and I will answer you, <f>ⓔ</f>and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known.
Jeremiah 33-4 For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense against <f>ⓕ</f>the siege mounds and against the sword:
Jeremiah 33-5 They are coming in <f>ⓖ</f>to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill them <f>[2]</f> with the dead bodies of men whom I shall strike down <f>ⓗ</f>in my anger and my wrath, <f>ⓘ</f>for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil.
Jeremiah 33-6 <f>ⓙ</f> Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security.
Jeremiah 33-7 <f>ⓚ</f> I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, <f>ⓛ</f>and rebuild them as they were <f>ⓜ</f>at first.
Jeremiah 33-8 <f>ⓝ</f> I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, <f>ⓞ</f>and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me.
Jeremiah 33-9 <f>ⓟ</f> And this city <f>[3]</f> shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them. They shall <f>ⓠ</f>fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.
Jeremiah 33-10 <pb/>“Thus says the LORD: In this place <f>ⓡ</f>of which you say, ‘It is a waste without man or beast,’ in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or beast, there shall be heard again
Jeremiah 33-11 <f>ⓢ</f> the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring <f>ⓣ</f>thank offerings to the house of the LORD: <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“‘Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, </t><t>for the LORD is good, </t><t>for his steadfast love endures forever!’ </t> <pb/><f>ⓥ</f>For I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the LORD.
Jeremiah 33-12 <pb/>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓦ</f>In this place that is waste, without man or beast, and in all of its cities, there shall again be <f>ⓧ</f>habitations of shepherds <f>ⓨ</f>resting their flocks.
Jeremiah 33-13 <f>ⓩ</f> In the cities of the hill country, <f>ⓐ</f>in the cities of the Shephelah, <f>ⓑ</f>and in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, <f>ⓒ</f>the places about Jerusalem, <f>ⓓ</f>and in the cities of Judah, <f>ⓔ</f>flocks shall again pass under the hands <f>ⓕ</f>of the one who counts them, says the LORD.
Jeremiah 33-14 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when <f>ⓗ</f>I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
Jeremiah 33-15 In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous <f>ⓘ</f>Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah 33-16 In those days Judah will be saved, <f>ⓙ</f>and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: <f>ⓚ</f>‘The LORD is our righteousness.’
Jeremiah 33-17 <pb/>“For thus says the LORD: <f>ⓛ</f>David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
Jeremiah 33-18 <f>ⓜ</f> and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices forever.”
Jeremiah 33-19 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 33-20 <f>ⓝ</f> “Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓞ</f>If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, <f>ⓟ</f>so that day and night will not come at their appointed time,
Jeremiah 33-21 <f>ⓠ</f> then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers.
Jeremiah 33-22 As <f>ⓡ</f>the host of heaven cannot be numbered and <f>ⓢ</f>the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant, and the Levitical priests who minister to me.”
Jeremiah 33-23 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 33-24 “Have you not observed that these people are saying, ‘The LORD has rejected the two clans that he chose’? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight.
Jeremiah 33-25 Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓣ</f>If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed order of heaven and earth,
Jeremiah 33-26 then I will reject the offspring of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his offspring to rule over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <f>ⓤ</f>For I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them.”
Hebrews 11-1 <pb/>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of <f>ⓐ</f>things not seen.
Hebrews 11-2 For by it the people of old received their commendation.
Hebrews 11-3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by <f>ⓑ</f>the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of <f>ⓒ</f>things that are visible.
Hebrews 11-4 <pb/>By faith <f>ⓓ</f>Abel offered to God <f>ⓔ</f>a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And <f>ⓕ</f>through his faith, though he died, he <f>ⓖ</f>still speaks.
Hebrews 11-5 By faith <f>ⓗ</f>Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God.
Hebrews 11-6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God <f>ⓘ</f>must believe that he exists and <f>ⓙ</f>that he rewards those who seek him.
Hebrews 11-7 By faith <f>ⓚ</f>Noah, being warned by God concerning <f>ⓛ</f>events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of <f>ⓜ</f>the righteousness that comes by faith.
Hebrews 11-8 <pb/>By faith <f>ⓝ</f>Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place <f>ⓞ</f>that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.
Hebrews 11-9 By faith he went to live in <f>ⓟ</f>the land of promise, as in a foreign land, <f>ⓠ</f>living in tents <f>ⓡ</f>with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.
Hebrews 11-10 For he was looking forward to <f>ⓢ</f>the city that has <f>ⓣ</f>foundations, <f>ⓤ</f>whose designer and builder is God.
Hebrews 11-11 By faith <f>ⓥ</f>Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered <f>ⓦ</f>him faithful who had promised.
Hebrews 11-12 Therefore from one man, and <f>ⓧ</f>him as good as dead, were born descendants <f>ⓨ</f>as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.
Hebrews 11-13 <pb/>These all died in faith, <f>ⓩ</f>not having received the things promised, but <f>ⓐ</f>having seen them and greeted them from afar, and <f>ⓑ</f>having acknowledged that they were <f>ⓒ</f>strangers and exiles on the earth.
Hebrews 11-14 For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
Hebrews 11-15 If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, <f>ⓓ</f>they would have had opportunity to return.
Hebrews 11-16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed <f>ⓔ</f>to be called their God, for <f>ⓕ</f>he has prepared for them a city.
Hebrews 11-17 <pb/>By faith <f>ⓖ</f>Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son,
Hebrews 11-18 of whom it was said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.”
Hebrews 11-19 <f>ⓘ</f> He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
Hebrews 11-20 By faith <f>ⓙ</f>Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.
Hebrews 11-21 By faith <f>ⓚ</f>Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, <f>ⓛ</f>bowing in worship over the head of his staff.
Hebrews 11-22 By faith <f>ⓜ</f>Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.
Hebrews 11-23 <pb/>By faith <f>ⓝ</f>Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of <f>ⓞ</f>the king's edict.
Hebrews 11-24 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, <f>ⓟ</f>refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
Hebrews 11-25 <f>ⓠ</f> choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy <f>ⓡ</f>the fleeting pleasures of sin.
Hebrews 11-26 <f>ⓢ</f> He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to <f>ⓣ</f>the reward.
Hebrews 11-27 By faith he <f>ⓤ</f>left Egypt, <f>ⓥ</f>not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured <f>ⓦ</f>as seeing him who is invisible.
Hebrews 11-28 By faith <f>ⓧ</f>he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.
Hebrews 11-29 <pb/>By faith <f>ⓨ</f>the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned.
Hebrews 11-30 By faith <f>ⓩ</f>the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.
Hebrews 11-31 By faith <f>ⓐ</f>Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she <f>ⓑ</f>had given a friendly welcome to the spies.
Hebrews 11-32 <pb/>And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of <f>ⓒ</f>Gideon, <f>ⓓ</f>Barak, <f>ⓔ</f>Samson, <f>ⓕ</f>Jephthah, of <f>ⓖ</f>David and <f>ⓗ</f>Samuel and the prophets —
Hebrews 11-33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, <f>ⓘ</f>stopped the mouths of lions,
Hebrews 11-34 <f>ⓙ</f> quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, <f>ⓚ</f>became mighty in war, <f>ⓛ</f>put foreign armies to flight.
Hebrews 11-35 <f>ⓜ</f> Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life.
Hebrews 11-36 Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even <f>ⓝ</f>chains and imprisonment.
Hebrews 11-37 <f>ⓞ</f> They were stoned, they were sawn in two, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>they were killed with the sword. <f>ⓠ</f>They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated —
Hebrews 11-38 of whom the world was not worthy — <f>ⓡ</f>wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
Hebrews 11-39 <pb/>And all these, <f>ⓢ</f>though commended through their faith, <f>ⓣ</f>did not receive what was promised,
Hebrews 11-40 since God had provided something better for us, <f>ⓤ</f>that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
