3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twelve years.
3-2 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, though not like his father and mother, for he put away the <f>ⓑ</f>pillar of Baal <f>ⓒ</f>that his father had made.
3-3 Nevertheless, he clung to <f>ⓓ</f>the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <f>ⓔ</f>which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it.
3-4 <pb/>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, <f>ⓕ</f>and he had to deliver to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams.
3-5 But <f>ⓖ</f>when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
3-6 So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.
3-7 And he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to battle against Moab?” And he said, “I will go. <f>ⓗ</f>I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
3-8 Then he said, “By which way shall we march?” Jehoram answered, “By the way of the wilderness of Edom.”
3-9 <pb/>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and <f>ⓘ</f>the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.
3-10 Then the king of Israel said, “Alas! <f>ⓙ</f>The LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.”
3-11 <f>ⓚ</f> And Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the LORD here, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?” Then one of the king of Israel's servants answered, <f>ⓛ</f>“Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, <f>ⓜ</f>who poured water on the hands of Elijah.”
3-12 And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
3-13 <pb/>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, <f>ⓝ</f>“What have I to do with you? Go to <f>ⓞ</f>the prophets of your father and to <f>ⓟ</f>the prophets of your mother.” But the king of Israel said to him, “No; it is <f>ⓠ</f>the LORD who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.”
3-14 And Elisha said, <f>ⓡ</f>“As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I have regard for Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would neither look at you nor see you.
3-15 But now <f>ⓢ</f>bring me a musician.” And when the musician played, <f>ⓣ</f>the hand of the LORD came upon him.
3-16 And he said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘I will make this dry streambed full of pools.’
3-17 For thus says the LORD, ‘You shall not see wind or rain, but that streambed shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your livestock, and your animals.’
3-18 This is a light thing in the sight of the LORD. He will also give the Moabites into your hand,
3-19 and you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree and stop up all springs of water <f>ⓤ</f>and ruin every good piece of land with stones.”
3-20 The next morning, about the time of <f>ⓥ</f>offering the sacrifice, behold, water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.
3-21 <pb/>When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out and were drawn up at the border.
3-22 And when they rose early in the morning and the sun shone on the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.
3-23 And they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely fought together and struck one another down. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!”
3-24 But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and struck the Moabites, till they fled before them. And they went forward, striking the Moabites as they went. <f>[1]</f>
3-25 And they overthrew the cities, and <f>ⓦ</f>on every good piece of land every man threw a stone until it was covered. They stopped every spring of water and felled all the good trees, till only its stones were left in <f>ⓧ</f>Kir-hareseth, and the slingers surrounded and attacked it.
3-26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him 700 <f>ⓨ</f>swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom, but they could not.
3-27 Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place <f>ⓩ</f>and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel. And they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.
2-1 <pb/>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
2-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> It shall come to pass in the latter days </t><t>that <f>ⓑ</f>the mountain of the house of the LORD </t><t>shall be established as the highest of the mountains, </t><t>and shall be lifted up above the hills; </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>all the nations shall flow to it,</t>
2-3 <t>and <f>ⓓ</f>many peoples shall come, and say: </t><t>“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, </t><t>to the house of the God of Jacob, </t><t>that he may teach us his ways </t><t>and that we may walk in his paths.” </t><t>For <f>ⓔ</f>out of Zion shall go forth the law, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</t>
2-4 <t>He shall judge between the nations, </t><t>and shall decide disputes for many peoples; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, </t><t>and their spears into pruning hooks; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>nation shall not lift up sword against nation, </t><t>neither shall they learn war anymore. </t>
2-5 <pb/><t>O house of Jacob, </t><t>come, let us walk </t><t>in <f>ⓗ</f>the light of the LORD. </t>
2-6 <pb/><t>For you have rejected your people, </t><t>the house of Jacob, </t><t>because they are full of things <f>ⓘ</f>from the east </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>of fortune-tellers <f>ⓚ</f>like the Philistines, </t><t>and they <f>ⓛ</f>strike hands with the children of foreigners.</t>
2-7 <t>Their land is <f>ⓜ</f>filled with silver and gold, </t><t>and there is no end to their treasures; </t><t>their land is <f>ⓝ</f>filled with horses, </t><t>and there is no end to their chariots.</t>
2-8 <t>Their land is <f>ⓞ</f>filled with idols; </t><t>they bow down to <f>ⓟ</f>the work of their hands, </t><t>to what their own fingers have made.</t>
2-9 <t>So man <f>ⓠ</f>is humbled, </t><t>and each one <f>ⓡ</f>is brought low — </t><t>do not forgive them!</t>
2-10 <t><f>ⓢ</f> Enter into the rock </t><t>and hide in the dust </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>from before the terror of the LORD, </t><t>and from the splendor of his majesty.</t>
2-11 <t><f>ⓤ</f> The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, </t><t>and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled, </t><t>and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day. </t>
2-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f> For the LORD of hosts has a day </t><t>against all that is proud and lofty, </t><t>against all that is lifted up — and it shall be brought low;</t>
2-13 <t>against all the <f>ⓦ</f>cedars of Lebanon, </t><t>lofty and lifted up; </t><t>and against all the <f>ⓧ</f>oaks of Bashan;</t>
2-14 <t>against all <f>ⓨ</f>the lofty mountains, </t><t>and against all the uplifted hills;</t>
2-15 <t>against every high tower, </t><t>and against every fortified wall;</t>
2-16 <t>against all <f>ⓩ</f>the ships of Tarshish, </t><t>and against all the beautiful craft.</t>
2-17 <t><f>ⓐ</f> And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, </t><t>and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low, </t><t>and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.</t>
2-18 <t><f>ⓑ</f> And the idols shall utterly pass away.</t>
2-19 <t><f>ⓒ</f> And people shall enter the caves of the rocks </t><t>and the holes of the ground, <f>[2]</f> </t><t>from before the terror of the LORD, </t><t>and from the splendor of his majesty, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>when he rises to terrify the earth. </t>
2-20 <pb/><t>In that day <f>ⓔ</f>mankind will cast away </t><t>their idols of silver and their idols of gold, </t><t>which they made for themselves to worship, </t><t>to the moles and to the <f>ⓕ</f>bats,</t>
2-21 <t><f>ⓖ</f> to enter the caverns of the rocks </t><t>and the clefts of the cliffs, </t><t>from before the terror of the LORD, </t><t>and from the splendor of his majesty, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>when he rises to terrify the earth.</t>
2-22 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Stop regarding man </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>in whose nostrils is breath, </t><t>for of what account is he? </t>
28-1 <pb/>After we were brought safely through, <f>ⓐ</f>we then learned that <f>ⓑ</f>the island was called Malta.
28-2 <f>ⓒ</f> The native people <f>[1]</f> showed us unusual <f>ⓓ</f>kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.
28-3 When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.
28-4 When <f>ⓔ</f>the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, <f>ⓕ</f>“No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, <f>ⓖ</f>Justice <f>[2]</f> has not allowed him to live.”
28-5 He, however, <f>ⓗ</f>shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
28-6 They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, <f>ⓘ</f>they changed their minds and <f>ⓙ</f>said that he was a god.
28-7 <pb/>Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
28-8 It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and <f>ⓚ</f>prayed, and <f>ⓛ</f>putting his hands on him, healed him.
28-9 And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.
28-10 They also honored us greatly, <f>[3]</f> and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.
28-11 <pb/>After three months we set sail in <f>ⓜ</f>a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods <f>[4]</f> as a figurehead.
28-12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
28-13 And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
28-14 There we found <f>ⓝ</f>brothers <f>[5]</f> and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
28-15 And <f>ⓞ</f>the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, <f>ⓟ</f>Paul thanked God and took courage.
28-16 And when we came into Rome, <f>ⓠ</f>Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.
28-17 <pb/>After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, “Brothers, <f>ⓡ</f>though I had done nothing against our people or <f>ⓢ</f>the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
28-18 When they had examined me, they <f>ⓣ</f>wished to set me at liberty, <f>ⓤ</f>because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.
28-19 But because the Jews objected, I was compelled <f>ⓥ</f>to appeal to Caesar — though I had no charge to bring against <f>ⓦ</f>my nation.
28-20 For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is <f>ⓧ</f>because of <f>ⓨ</f>the hope of Israel that I am wearing <f>ⓩ</f>this <f>ⓐ</f>chain.”
28-21 And they said to him, “We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of <f>ⓑ</f>the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you.
28-22 But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this <f>ⓒ</f>sect we know that everywhere <f>ⓓ</f>it is spoken against.”
28-23 <pb/>When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening <f>ⓔ</f>he expounded to them, testifying to <f>ⓕ</f>the kingdom of God and <f>ⓖ</f>trying to convince them about Jesus <f>ⓗ</f>both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.
28-24 And <f>ⓘ</f>some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved.
28-25 And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: <f>ⓙ</f>“The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:
28-26 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> “‘Go to this people, and say, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>“You will indeed hear but never understand, </t><t>and you will indeed see but never perceive.”</t>
28-27 <t><f>ⓜ</f> For this people's heart has grown dull, </t><t>and with their ears they can barely hear, </t><t>and their eyes they have closed; </t><t>lest they should see with their eyes </t><t>and hear with their ears </t><t>and understand with their heart </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>turn, and I would heal them.’ </t>
28-28 <pb/>Therefore let it be known to you that <f>ⓞ</f>this <f>ⓟ</f>salvation of God <f>ⓠ</f>has been sent to the Gentiles; <f>ⓡ</f>they will listen.” <f>[6]</f>
28-29 
28-30 <pb/>He lived there two whole years at his own expense, <f>[7]</f> and <f>ⓢ</f>welcomed all who came to him,
28-31 <f>ⓣ</f> proclaiming <f>ⓤ</f>the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ <f>ⓥ</f>with all boldness and <f>ⓦ</f>without hindrance.
