Genesis 46-1 <pb/>So Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to <f>ⓐ</f>Beersheba, and offered sacrifices <f>ⓑ</f>to the God of his father Isaac.
Genesis 46-2 And God spoke to Israel <f>ⓒ</f>in visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob.” And he said, “Here I am.”
Genesis 46-3 Then he said, “I am God, <f>ⓓ</f>the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will <f>ⓔ</f>make you into a great nation.
Genesis 46-4 I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also <f>ⓕ</f>bring you up again, and <f>ⓖ</f>Joseph's hand shall close your eyes.”
Genesis 46-5 <pb/>Then Jacob set out from Beersheba. The sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons <f>ⓗ</f>that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Genesis 46-6 They also took their livestock and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and <f>ⓘ</f>came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him,
Genesis 46-7 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters. All his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.
Genesis 46-8 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Now <f>ⓚ</f>these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons. <f>ⓛ</f>Reuben, Jacob's firstborn,
Genesis 46-9 and the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
Genesis 46-10 The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
Genesis 46-11 The sons of <f>ⓜ</f>Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Genesis 46-12 The sons of <f>ⓝ</f>Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but <f>ⓞ</f>Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan); and the sons of <f>ⓟ</f>Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
Genesis 46-13 <f>ⓠ</f> The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Yob, and Shimron.
Genesis 46-14 The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
Genesis 46-15 These are the sons of Leah, <f>ⓡ</f>whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah; altogether his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three.
Genesis 46-16 <pb/>The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
Genesis 46-17 <f>ⓢ</f> The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, with Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
Genesis 46-18 <f>ⓣ</f> These are the sons of Zilpah, <f>ⓤ</f>whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob — sixteen persons.
Genesis 46-19 <pb/>The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis 46-20 And <f>ⓥ</f>to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of <f>ⓦ</f>On, bore to him.
Genesis 46-21 And <f>ⓧ</f>the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
Genesis 46-22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob — fourteen persons in all.
Genesis 46-23 <pb/>The son <f>[1]</f> of Dan: Hushim.
Genesis 46-24 <f>ⓨ</f> The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
Genesis 46-25 <f>ⓩ</f> These are the sons of Bilhah, <f>ⓐ</f>whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob — seven persons in all.
Genesis 46-26 <pb/>All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own descendants, not including Jacob's sons' wives, were sixty-six persons in all.
Genesis 46-27 And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two. <f>ⓑ</f>All the persons of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy.
Genesis 46-28 <pb/>He had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to show the way before him in Goshen, and they came <f>ⓒ</f>into the land of Goshen.
Genesis 46-29 Then Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen. He presented himself to him and <f>ⓓ</f>fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.
Genesis 46-30 Israel said to Joseph, <f>ⓔ</f>“Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.”
Genesis 46-31 Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, <f>ⓕ</f>“I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him, ‘My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
Genesis 46-32 <f>ⓖ</f> And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’
Genesis 46-33 When Pharaoh calls you and says, <f>ⓗ</f>‘What is your occupation?’
Genesis 46-34 you shall say, <f>ⓘ</f>‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock <f>ⓙ</f>from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,’ in order that you may dwell <f>ⓚ</f>in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is <f>ⓛ</f>an abomination to the Egyptians.”
Ezra 8-1 <pb/>These are the heads of their fathers' houses, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylonia, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:
Ezra 8-2 Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of <f>ⓐ</f>Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, <f>ⓑ</f>Hattush.
Ezra 8-3 Of the sons of Shecaniah, who was of the sons of <f>ⓒ</f>Parosh, Zechariah, with whom were registered 150 men.
Ezra 8-4 <f>ⓓ</f> Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men.
Ezra 8-5 Of the sons of Zattu, <f>[1]</f> Shecaniah the son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men.
Ezra 8-6 Of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men.
Ezra 8-7 Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men.
Ezra 8-8 Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him 80 men.
Ezra 8-9 Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men.
Ezra 8-10 Of the sons of Bani, <f>[2]</f> Shelomith the son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men.
Ezra 8-11 <f>ⓔ</f> Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah, the son of Bebai, and with him 28 men.
Ezra 8-12 Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men.
Ezra 8-13 Of the sons of Adonikam, those who came later, their names being Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men.
Ezra 8-14 Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them 70 men.
Ezra 8-15 <pb/>I gathered them to the river that runs to <f>ⓕ</f>Ahava, and there we camped three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there <f>ⓖ</f>none of the sons of Levi.
Ezra 8-16 Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and <f>ⓗ</f>Meshullam, leading men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of insight,
Ezra 8-17 and sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brothers and <f>[3]</f> the temple servants at the place Casiphia, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God.
Ezra 8-18 And <f>ⓘ</f>by the good hand of our God on us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of <f>ⓙ</f>Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen, 18;
Ezra 8-19 also <f>ⓚ</f>Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of <f>ⓛ</f>the sons of Merari, with his kinsmen and their sons, 20;
Ezra 8-20 <f>ⓜ</f> besides 220 of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all <f>ⓝ</f>mentioned by name.
Ezra 8-21 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river <f>ⓟ</f>Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, <f>ⓠ</f>to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our goods.
Ezra 8-22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king, <f>ⓡ</f>“The hand of our God is for good on <f>ⓢ</f>all who seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all who forsake him.”
Ezra 8-23 So we fasted and implored our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.
Ezra 8-24 <pb/>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: <f>ⓣ</f>Sherebiah, <f>ⓤ</f>Hashabiah, and ten of their kinsmen with them.
Ezra 8-25 And I weighed out to them the <f>ⓥ</f>silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God that the king and his <f>ⓦ</f>counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered.
Ezra 8-26 <f>ⓧ</f> I weighed out into their hand 650 talents <f>[4]</f> of silver, and silver vessels worth 200 talents, <f>[5]</f> and 100 talents of gold,
Ezra 8-27 20 bowls of gold worth 1,000 darics, <f>[6]</f> and two vessels of fine bright bronze as precious as gold.
Ezra 8-28 And I said to them, <f>ⓨ</f>“You are holy to the LORD, and <f>ⓩ</f>the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.
Ezra 8-29 Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at Jerusalem, <f>ⓐ</f>within the chambers of the house of the LORD.”
Ezra 8-30 So the priests and the Levites <f>ⓑ</f>took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.
Ezra 8-31 <pb/>Then we departed from the river Ahava <f>ⓒ</f>on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. <f>ⓓ</f>The hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the way.
Ezra 8-32 <f>ⓔ</f> We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days.
Ezra 8-33 On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver and the gold and the vessels were <f>ⓕ</f>weighed into the hands of <f>ⓖ</f>Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them were the Levites, <f>ⓗ</f>Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of <f>ⓘ</f>Binnui.
Ezra 8-34 The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.
Ezra 8-35 <pb/>At that time <f>ⓙ</f>those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, <f>ⓚ</f>twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
Ezra 8-36 <f>ⓛ</f> They also delivered the king's commissions to the king's <f>ⓜ</f>satraps <f>[7]</f> and to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and they aided the people and the house of God.
Jeremiah 31-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “At that time, declares the LORD, <f>ⓑ</f>I will be the God of all the clans of Israel, and they shall be my people.”
Jeremiah 31-2 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t>“The people who survived the sword </t><t>found grace in the wilderness; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>when Israel sought for rest,</t>
Jeremiah 31-3 <t>the LORD appeared to him <f>[1]</f> from far away. </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>I have loved you with an everlasting love; </t><t>therefore <f>ⓔ</f>I have continued <f>ⓕ</f>my faithfulness to you.</t>
Jeremiah 31-4 <t><f>ⓖ</f> Again I will build you, and you shall be built, </t><t>O virgin Israel! </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>Again you shall adorn yourself with tambourines </t><t>and shall go forth in <f>ⓘ</f>the dance of the merrymakers.</t>
Jeremiah 31-5 <t><f>ⓙ</f> Again you shall plant vineyards </t><t>on the mountains of Samaria; </t><t>the planters shall plant </t><t>and shall enjoy the fruit.</t>
Jeremiah 31-6 <t>For there shall be a day when watchmen will call </t><t>in <f>ⓚ</f>the hill country of Ephraim: </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>‘Arise, and let us go up to Zion, </t><t>to the LORD our God.’” </t>
Jeremiah 31-7 <pb/><t>For thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>“Sing aloud with gladness for Jacob, </t><t>and raise shouts for <f>ⓝ</f>the chief of the nations; </t><t>proclaim, give praise, and say, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>‘O LORD, save your people, </t><t>the remnant of Israel.’</t>
Jeremiah 31-8 <t>Behold, I will bring them <f>ⓟ</f>from the north country </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>gather them from <f>ⓡ</f>the farthest parts of the earth, </t><t>among them <f>ⓢ</f>the blind and the lame, </t><t>the pregnant woman and she who is in labor, together; </t><t>a great company, they shall return here.</t>
Jeremiah 31-9 <t><f>ⓣ</f> With weeping they shall come, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>and with pleas for mercy I will lead them back, </t><t>I will make them <f>ⓥ</f>walk by brooks of water, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>in a straight path in which they shall not stumble, </t><t>for <f>ⓧ</f>I am a father to Israel, </t><t>and Ephraim is <f>ⓨ</f>my firstborn. </t>
Jeremiah 31-10 <pb/><t>“Hear the word of the LORD, O nations, </t><t>and declare it in the coastlands far away; </t><t>say, ‘He who scattered Israel will <f>ⓩ</f>gather him, </t><t>and will keep him <f>ⓐ</f>as a shepherd keeps his flock.’</t>
Jeremiah 31-11 <t><f>ⓑ</f> For the LORD has ransomed Jacob </t><t>and has redeemed him from <f>ⓒ</f>hands too strong for him.</t>
Jeremiah 31-12 <t>They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>and they shall be radiant <f>ⓔ</f>over the goodness of the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>over the grain, the wine, and the oil, </t><t>and over the young of the flock and the herd; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>their life shall be like a watered garden, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and they shall languish no more.</t>
Jeremiah 31-13 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance, </t><t>and the young men and the old shall be merry. </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>I will turn their mourning into joy; </t><t>I will comfort them, and give them gladness for sorrow.</t>
Jeremiah 31-14 <t><f>ⓚ</f> I will feast the soul of the priests with abundance, </t><t>and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, <pb/>declares the LORD.” </t>
Jeremiah 31-15 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>“A voice is heard in <f>ⓜ</f>Ramah, </t><t>lamentation and bitter weeping. </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>Rachel is weeping for her children; </t><t>she refuses to be comforted for her children, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>because they are no more.” </t>
Jeremiah 31-16 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t>“Keep your voice from weeping, </t><t>and your eyes from tears, </t><t>for there is a reward for your work, <pb/>declares the LORD, </t><t>and <f>ⓟ</f>they shall come back from the land of the enemy.</t>
Jeremiah 31-17 <t><f>ⓠ</f> There is hope for your future, <pb/>declares the LORD, </t><t>and your children shall come back to their own country.</t>
Jeremiah 31-18 <t>I have heard <f>ⓡ</f>Ephraim grieving, </t><t>‘You have disciplined me, and I was disciplined, </t><t>like an untrained calf; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>bring me back that I may be restored, </t><t>for you are the LORD my God.</t>
Jeremiah 31-19 <t>For after <f>ⓣ</f>I had turned away, I relented, </t><t>and after I was instructed, <f>ⓤ</f>I struck my thigh; </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>I was ashamed, and I was confounded, </t><t>because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’</t>
Jeremiah 31-20 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Is Ephraim my dear son? </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>Is he my darling child? </t><t>For as often as I speak against him, </t><t>I do remember him still. </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>Therefore my heart <f>[2]</f> yearns for him; </t><t>I will surely have mercy on him, <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
Jeremiah 31-21 <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f> “Set up road markers for yourself; </t><t>make yourself guideposts; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>consider well the highway, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>the road by which you went. </t><t>Return, O virgin Israel, </t><t>return to these your cities.</t>
Jeremiah 31-22 <t><f>ⓒ</f> How long will you waver, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>O faithless daughter? </t><t>For the LORD has created a new thing on the earth: </t><t>a woman encircles a man.” </t>
Jeremiah 31-23 <pb/>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in its cities, <f>ⓔ</f>when I restore their fortunes: <pb/><t><f>ⓕ</f>“‘The LORD bless you, <f>ⓖ</f>O habitation of righteousness, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>O holy hill!’ </t>
Jeremiah 31-24 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together, and <f>ⓙ</f>the farmers and those who wander with their flocks.
Jeremiah 31-25 For I will <f>ⓚ</f>satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I will replenish.”
Jeremiah 31-26 <pb/>At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.
Jeremiah 31-27 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when <f>ⓜ</f>I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with <f>ⓝ</f>the seed of man and the seed of beast.
Jeremiah 31-28 And it shall come to pass that <f>ⓞ</f>as I have watched over them <f>ⓟ</f>to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring harm, <f>ⓠ</f>so I will watch over them <f>ⓡ</f>to build and to plant, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 31-29 In those days they shall no longer say: <pb/><t><f>ⓢ</f>“‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, </t><t>and the children's teeth are set on edge.’ </t>
Jeremiah 31-30 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> But everyone shall die for his own iniquity. Each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
Jeremiah 31-31 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make <f>ⓥ</f>a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah,
Jeremiah 31-32 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when <f>ⓦ</f>I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, <f>ⓧ</f>though I was their husband, declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 31-33 <f>ⓨ</f> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: <f>ⓩ</f>I will put my law within them, and I will write it <f>ⓐ</f>on their hearts. <f>ⓑ</f>And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Jeremiah 31-34 And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ <f>ⓒ</f>for they shall all know me, <f>ⓓ</f>from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For <f>ⓔ</f>I will forgive their iniquity, and <f>ⓕ</f>I will remember their sin no more.”
Jeremiah 31-35 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD, </t><t>who <f>ⓖ</f>gives the sun for light by day </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, </t><t>who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar — </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>the LORD of hosts is his name:</t>
Jeremiah 31-36 <t><f>ⓙ</f> “If this fixed order departs </t><t>from before me, declares the LORD, </t><t>then shall the offspring of Israel cease </t><t>from being a nation before me forever.” </t>
Jeremiah 31-37 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t>“If the heavens above can be measured, </t><t>and the foundations of the earth below can be explored, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>then I will cast off all the offspring of Israel </t><t>for all that they have done, <pb/>declares the LORD.” </t>
Jeremiah 31-38 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when the city shall be rebuilt for the LORD <f>ⓜ</f>from the Tower of Hananel to <f>ⓝ</f>the Corner Gate.
Jeremiah 31-39 <f>ⓞ</f> And the measuring line shall go out farther, straight to the hill Gareb, and shall then turn to Goah.
Jeremiah 31-40 <f>ⓟ</f> The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields as far as the <f>ⓠ</f>brook Kidron, to the corner of <f>ⓡ</f>the Horse Gate toward the east, <f>ⓢ</f>shall be sacred to the LORD. <f>ⓣ</f>It shall not be plucked up or overthrown anymore forever.”
Hebrews 9-1 <pb/>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and <f>ⓐ</f>an earthly place of holiness.
Hebrews 9-2 For <f>ⓑ</f>a tent <f>[1]</f> was prepared, the first section, in which were <f>ⓒ</f>the lampstand and <f>ⓓ</f>the table and <f>ⓔ</f>the bread of the Presence. <f>[2]</f> It is called the Holy Place.
Hebrews 9-3 Behind <f>ⓕ</f>the second curtain was a second section <f>[3]</f> called the Most Holy Place,
Hebrews 9-4 having the golden <f>ⓖ</f>altar of incense and <f>ⓗ</f>the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was <f>ⓘ</f>a golden urn holding the manna, and <f>ⓙ</f>Aaron's staff that budded, and <f>ⓚ</f>the tablets of the covenant.
Hebrews 9-5 Above it were <f>ⓛ</f>the cherubim of glory overshadowing <f>ⓜ</f>the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
Hebrews 9-6 <pb/>These preparations having thus been made, <f>ⓝ</f>the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties,
Hebrews 9-7 but into the second only <f>ⓞ</f>the high priest goes, and he but <f>ⓟ</f>once a year, and not without taking blood, <f>ⓠ</f>which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.
Hebrews 9-8 By this the Holy Spirit indicates that <f>ⓡ</f>the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing
Hebrews 9-9 (which is symbolic for the present age). <f>[4]</f> According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered <f>ⓢ</f>that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,
Hebrews 9-10 but deal only with <f>ⓣ</f>food and drink and <f>ⓤ</f>various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.
Hebrews 9-11 <pb/>But when Christ appeared as a high priest <f>ⓥ</f>of the good things that have come, <f>[5]</f> then through <f>ⓦ</f>the greater and more perfect tent (<f>ⓧ</f>not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)
Hebrews 9-12 he <f>ⓨ</f>entered <f>ⓩ</f>once for all into the holy places, not by means of <f>ⓐ</f>the blood of goats and calves but <f>ⓑ</f>by means of his own blood, <f>ⓒ</f>thus securing an eternal redemption.
Hebrews 9-13 For if <f>ⓓ</f>the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with <f>ⓔ</f>the ashes of a heifer, sanctify <f>[6]</f> for the purification of the flesh,
Hebrews 9-14 how much more will <f>ⓕ</f>the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit <f>ⓖ</f>offered himself without blemish to God, <f>ⓗ</f>purify our <f>[7]</f> conscience <f>ⓘ</f>from dead works <f>ⓙ</f>to serve the living God.
Hebrews 9-15 <pb/>Therefore he is <f>ⓚ</f>the mediator of a new covenant, so that <f>ⓛ</f>those who are called may <f>ⓜ</f>receive the promised eternal inheritance, <f>ⓝ</f>since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. <f>[8]</f>
Hebrews 9-16 For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.
Hebrews 9-17 For <f>ⓞ</f>a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.
Hebrews 9-18 Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated <f>ⓟ</f>without blood.
Hebrews 9-19 For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took <f>ⓠ</f>the blood of calves and goats, <f>ⓡ</f>with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
Hebrews 9-20 saying, <f>ⓢ</f>“This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.”
Hebrews 9-21 And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both <f>ⓣ</f>the tent and all the vessels used in worship.
Hebrews 9-22 Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and <f>ⓤ</f>without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
Hebrews 9-23 <pb/>Thus it was necessary for <f>ⓥ</f>the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews 9-24 For Christ has entered, not into holy places <f>ⓦ</f>made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God <f>ⓧ</f>on our behalf.
Hebrews 9-25 Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as <f>ⓨ</f>the high priest enters <f>ⓩ</f>the holy places every year with blood not his own,
Hebrews 9-26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, <f>ⓐ</f>he has appeared <f>ⓑ</f>once for all <f>ⓒ</f>at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews 9-27 And just as <f>ⓓ</f>it is appointed for man to die once, and <f>ⓔ</f>after that comes judgment,
Hebrews 9-28 so Christ, having been offered once <f>ⓕ</f>to bear the sins of <f>ⓖ</f>many, will appear <f>ⓗ</f>a second time, <f>ⓘ</f>not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly <f>ⓙ</f>waiting for him.
