2 Samuel 10-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> After this the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
2 Samuel 10-2 And David said, “I will deal loyally <f>[1]</f> with Hanun the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the Ammonites.
2 Samuel 10-3 But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it?”
2 Samuel 10-4 So Hanun took David's servants and shaved off half the beard of each and cut off their garments in the middle, <f>ⓒ</f>at their hips, and sent them away.
2 Samuel 10-5 When it was told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.”
2 Samuel 10-6 <pb/>When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of <f>ⓓ</f>Beth-rehob, and <f>ⓔ</f>the Syrians of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of <f>ⓕ</f>Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of <f>ⓖ</f>Tob, 12,000 men.
2 Samuel 10-7 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of <f>ⓗ</f>the mighty men.
2 Samuel 10-8 And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate, and <f>ⓘ</f>the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and <f>ⓙ</f>the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.
2 Samuel 10-9 <pb/>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.
2 Samuel 10-10 The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites.
2 Samuel 10-11 And he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
2 Samuel 10-12 <f>ⓚ</f> Be of good courage, and <f>ⓛ</f>let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God, and <f>ⓜ</f>may the LORD do what seems good to him.”
2 Samuel 10-13 So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.
2 Samuel 10-14 And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 10-15 <pb/>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.
2 Samuel 10-16 And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond <f>ⓝ</f>the Euphrates. <f>[2]</f> They came to Helam, with <f>ⓞ</f>Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
2 Samuel 10-17 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. The Syrians arrayed themselves against David and fought with him.
2 Samuel 10-18 And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 700 chariots, and 40,000 horsemen, and wounded <f>ⓟ</f>Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there.
2 Samuel 10-19 And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel <f>ⓠ</f>and became subject to them. So the Syrians were afraid to save the Ammonites anymore.

John 10-1 <pb/><J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber.</J>
John 10-2 <J>But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</J>
John 10-3 <J>To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</J>
John 10-4 <J>When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</J>
John 10-5 <J><f>ⓐ</f> A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”</J>
John 10-6 This figure of speech Jesus <f>ⓑ</f>used with them, but they <f>ⓒ</f>did not understand what he was saying to them.
John 10-7 <pb/>So Jesus again said to them, <J>“Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓓ</f>I am the door of the sheep.</J>
John 10-8 <J>All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</J>
John 10-9 <J>I am the door. If anyone enters by me, <f>ⓔ</f>he will be saved and will go in and out and <f>ⓕ</f>find pasture.</J>
John 10-10 <J>The thief comes only to steal and <f>ⓖ</f>kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.</J>
John 10-11 <J><f>ⓗ</f> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd <f>ⓘ</f>lays down his life for the sheep.</J>
John 10-12 <J>He who is <f>ⓙ</f>a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and <f>ⓚ</f>leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and <f>ⓛ</f>scatters them.</J>
John 10-13 <J>He flees because <f>ⓜ</f>he is a hired hand and <f>ⓝ</f>cares nothing for the sheep.</J>
John 10-14 <J><f>ⓞ</f> I am the good shepherd. <f>ⓟ</f>I know my own and <f>ⓠ</f>my own know me,</J>
John 10-15 <J><f>ⓡ</f> just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and <f>ⓢ</f>I lay down my life for the sheep.</J>
John 10-16 <J>And <f>ⓣ</f>I have other sheep that are not of this fold. <f>ⓤ</f>I must bring them also, and <f>ⓥ</f>they will listen to my voice. So there will be <f>ⓦ</f>one flock, <f>ⓧ</f>one shepherd.</J>
John 10-17 <J><f>ⓨ</f> For this reason the Father loves me, <f>ⓩ</f>because <f>ⓐ</f>I lay down my life that I may take it up again.</J>
John 10-18 <J><f>ⓑ</f> No one takes it from me, but <f>ⓒ</f>I lay it down <f>ⓓ</f>of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and <f>ⓔ</f>I have authority to take it up again. <f>ⓕ</f>This charge I have received from my Father.”</J>
John 10-19 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.
John 10-20 Many of them said, <f>ⓗ</f>“He has a demon, and <f>ⓘ</f>is insane; why listen to him?”
John 10-21 Others said, “These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. <f>ⓙ</f>Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
John 10-22 <pb/>At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter,
John 10-23 and Jesus was walking in the temple, <f>ⓚ</f>in the colonnade of Solomon.
John 10-24 So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are <f>ⓛ</f>the Christ, <f>ⓜ</f>tell us plainly.”
John 10-25 Jesus answered them, <J>“I told you, and you do not believe. <f>ⓝ</f>The works that I do <f>ⓞ</f>in my Father's name bear witness about me,</J>
John 10-26 <J>but <f>ⓟ</f>you do not believe because you are not among my sheep.</J>
John 10-27 <J><f>ⓠ</f> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</J>
John 10-28 <J><f>ⓡ</f> I give them eternal life, and <f>ⓢ</f>they will never perish, and <f>ⓣ</f>no one will snatch them out of my hand.</J>
John 10-29 <J>My Father, <f>ⓤ</f>who has given them to me, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓥ</f>is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of <f>ⓦ</f>the Father's hand.</J>
John 10-30 <J><f>ⓧ</f> I and the Father are one.”</J>
John 10-31 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.
John 10-32 Jesus answered them, <J>“I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?”</J>
John 10-33 The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but <f>ⓩ</f>for blasphemy, because you, being a man, <f>ⓐ</f>make yourself God.”
John 10-34 Jesus answered them, <J>“Is it not written in <f>ⓑ</f>your Law, <f>ⓒ</f>‘I said, you are gods’?</J>
John 10-35 <J>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came — and Scripture cannot be <f>ⓓ</f>broken — </J>
John 10-36 <J>do you say of him whom <f>ⓔ</f>the Father consecrated and <f>ⓕ</f>sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because <f>ⓖ</f>I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</J>
John 10-37 <J><f>ⓗ</f> If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;</J>
John 10-38 <J>but if I do them, <f>ⓘ</f>even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that <f>ⓙ</f>the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”</J>
John 10-39 <f>ⓚ</f> Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.
John 10-40 <pb/>He went away again across the Jordan to the place <f>ⓛ</f>where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained.
John 10-41 And many came to him. And they said, “John did no sign, but <f>ⓜ</f>everything that John said about this man was true.”
John 10-42 And <f>ⓝ</f>many believed in him there.
