Exodus 14-1 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses,
Exodus 14-2 “Tell the people of Israel to <f>ⓐ</f>turn back and encamp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between <f>ⓑ</f>Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-zephon; you shall encamp facing it, by the sea.
Exodus 14-3 For Pharaoh will say of the people of Israel, ‘They are wandering in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’
Exodus 14-4 And <f>ⓒ</f>I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them, and I will <f>ⓓ</f>get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, <f>ⓔ</f>and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD.” And they did so.
Exodus 14-5 <pb/>When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the <f>ⓕ</f>mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?”
Exodus 14-6 So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him,
Exodus 14-7 and took <f>ⓖ</f>six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.
Exodus 14-8 And <f>ⓗ</f>the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the people of Israel while <f>ⓘ</f>the people of Israel were going out defiantly.
Exodus 14-9 The <f>ⓙ</f>Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them <f>ⓚ</f>encamped at the sea, by Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.
Exodus 14-10 <pb/>When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they feared greatly. And the people of Israel <f>ⓛ</f>cried out to the LORD.
Exodus 14-11 They <f>ⓜ</f>said to Moses, “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt?
Exodus 14-12 Is not this what <f>ⓝ</f>we said to you in Egypt: ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”
Exodus 14-13 And Moses said to the people, <f>ⓞ</f>“Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today. For <f>ⓟ</f>the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.
Exodus 14-14 <f>ⓠ</f> The LORD will fight for you, and you have only <f>ⓡ</f>to be silent.”
Exodus 14-15 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward.
Exodus 14-16 <f>ⓢ</f> Lift up your staff, and <f>ⓣ</f>stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground.
Exodus 14-17 And <f>ⓤ</f>I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and <f>ⓥ</f>I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen.
Exodus 14-18 And the Egyptians <f>ⓦ</f>shall know that I am the LORD, <f>ⓧ</f>when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”
Exodus 14-19 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Then the angel of God who was going before the host of Israel moved and went behind them, and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them,
Exodus 14-20 coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness. And it lit up the night <f>[1]</f> without one coming near the other all night.
Exodus 14-21 <pb/>Then Moses <f>ⓩ</f>stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD drove the sea back by <f>ⓐ</f>a strong east wind all night and <f>ⓑ</f>made the sea dry land, and the waters were <f>ⓒ</f>divided.
Exodus 14-22 And <f>ⓓ</f>the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being <f>ⓔ</f>a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Exodus 14-23 The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
Exodus 14-24 And in the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down on the Egyptian forces and threw the Egyptian forces into a panic,
Exodus 14-25 clogging <f>[2]</f> their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from before Israel, for the <f>ⓕ</f>LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.”
Exodus 14-26 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓖ</f>“Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.”
Exodus 14-27 <f>ⓗ</f> So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea <f>ⓘ</f>returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the LORD <f>ⓙ</f>threw <f>[3]</f> the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.
Exodus 14-28 The <f>ⓚ</f>waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea, <f>ⓛ</f>not one of them remained.
Exodus 14-29 But the <f>ⓜ</f>people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Exodus 14-30 <pb/>Thus the LORD <f>ⓝ</f>saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
Exodus 14-31 <f>ⓞ</f> Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they <f>ⓟ</f>believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.
Esther 3-1 <pb/>After these things King Ahasuerus <f>ⓐ</f>promoted Haman <f>ⓑ</f>the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, <f>ⓒ</f>and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him.
Esther 3-2 And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. <f>ⓓ</f>But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage.
Esther 3-3 Then the king's servants who were <f>ⓔ</f>at the king's gate said to Mordecai, “Why do you transgress <f>ⓕ</f>the king's command?”
Esther 3-4 And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai's words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew.
Esther 3-5 And when Haman saw that <f>ⓖ</f>Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was <f>ⓗ</f>filled with fury.
Esther 3-6 But he disdained <f>[1]</f> to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy <f>[2]</f> all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.
Esther 3-7 <pb/>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, <f>ⓘ</f>they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is <f>ⓙ</f>the month of Adar.
Esther 3-8 Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. <f>ⓚ</f>Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not to the king's profit to tolerate them.
Esther 3-9 If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents <f>[3]</f> of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, that they may put it into the king's treasuries.”
Esther 3-10 <f>ⓛ</f> So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman <f>ⓜ</f>the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, <f>ⓝ</f>the enemy of the Jews.
Esther 3-11 And the king said to Haman, “The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.”
Esther 3-12 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Then the king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's <f>ⓟ</f>satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, <f>ⓠ</f>to every province in its own script and every people in its own language. It was written <f>ⓡ</f>in the name of King Ahasuerus <f>ⓢ</f>and sealed with the king's signet ring.
Esther 3-13 Letters were sent <f>ⓣ</f>by couriers to all the king's provinces with instruction <f>ⓤ</f>to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, <f>ⓥ</f>in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, <f>ⓦ</f>and to plunder their goods.
Esther 3-14 <f>ⓧ</f> A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day.
Esther 3-15 <f>ⓨ</f> The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, <f>ⓩ</f>but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.
