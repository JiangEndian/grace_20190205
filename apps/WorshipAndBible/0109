2 Kings 6-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See, the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us.
2 Kings 6-2 Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there.” And he answered, “Go.”
2 Kings 6-3 Then one of them said, “Be pleased to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I will go.”
2 Kings 6-4 So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.
2 Kings 6-5 But as one was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water, and he cried out, “Alas, my master! It was borrowed.”
2 Kings 6-6 Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he showed him the place, <f>ⓑ</f>he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.
2 Kings 6-7 And he said, “Take it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.
2 Kings 6-8 <pb/>Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.”
2 Kings 6-9 But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there.”
2 Kings 6-10 And the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.
2 Kings 6-11 <pb/>And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing, and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?”
2 Kings 6-12 And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”
2 Kings 6-13 And he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him.” It was told him, “Behold, he is in <f>ⓒ</f>Dothan.”
2 Kings 6-14 So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.
2 Kings 6-15 <pb/>When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”
2 Kings 6-16 He said, “Do not be afraid, <f>ⓓ</f>for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”
2 Kings 6-17 Then Elisha prayed and said, “O LORD, please <f>ⓔ</f>open his eyes that he may see.” So the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of <f>ⓕ</f>horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
2 Kings 6-18 And when the Syrians came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, “Please strike this people with blindness.” <f>ⓖ</f>So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Elisha.
2 Kings 6-19 And Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” And he led them to Samaria.
2 Kings 6-20 <pb/>As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O LORD, <f>ⓗ</f>open the eyes of these men, that they may see.” So the LORD opened their eyes and they saw, and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
2 Kings 6-21 As soon as the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, <f>ⓘ</f>“My father, shall I strike them down? Shall I strike them down?”
2 Kings 6-22 He answered, “You shall not strike them down. Would you strike down those whom you have taken captive <f>ⓙ</f>with your sword and with your bow? <f>ⓚ</f>Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.”
2 Kings 6-23 So he prepared for them a great feast, and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the Syrians did not come again <f>ⓛ</f>on raids into the land of Israel.
2 Kings 6-24 <pb/>Afterward <f>ⓜ</f>Ben-hadad king of Syria mustered his entire army and went up and besieged Samaria.
2 Kings 6-25 And there was a great famine in Samaria, as they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab <f>[1]</f> of dove's dung for five shekels of silver.
2 Kings 6-26 Now as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”
2 Kings 6-27 And he said, “If the LORD will not help you, how shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the winepress?”
2 Kings 6-28 And the king asked her, “What is your trouble?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’
2 Kings 6-29 <f>ⓝ</f> So we boiled my son and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him.’ But she has hidden her son.”
2 Kings 6-30 When the king heard the words of the woman, <f>ⓞ</f>he tore his clothes — now he was passing by on the wall — and the people looked, and behold, <f>ⓟ</f>he had sackcloth beneath on his body —
2 Kings 6-31 and he said, <f>ⓠ</f>“May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today.”
2 Kings 6-32 <pb/>Elisha was sitting in his house, <f>ⓡ</f>and the elders were sitting with him. Now the king had dispatched a man from his presence, but before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders, “Do you see how this <f>ⓢ</f>murderer has sent to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?”
2 Kings 6-33 And while he was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him and said, “This trouble is from the LORD! <f>ⓣ</f>Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?”
Isaiah 5-1 <pb/><t>Let me sing for my beloved </t><t>my love song concerning his vineyard: </t><t>My beloved had <f>ⓐ</f>a vineyard </t><t>on a very fertile hill.</t>
Isaiah 5-2 <t>He dug it and cleared it of stones, </t><t>and planted it with <f>ⓑ</f>choice vines; </t><t>he built a watchtower in the midst of it, </t><t>and hewed out a wine vat in it; </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>he looked for it to yield grapes, </t><t>but it yielded wild grapes. </t>
Isaiah 5-3 <pb/><t>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem </t><t>and men of Judah, </t><t>judge between me and my vineyard.</t>
Isaiah 5-4 <t><f>ⓓ</f> What more was there to do for my vineyard, </t><t>that I have not done in it? </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>When I looked for it to yield grapes, </t><t>why did it yield wild grapes? </t>
Isaiah 5-5 <pb/><t>And now I will tell you </t><t>what I will do to my vineyard. </t><t>I will remove <f>ⓕ</f>its hedge, </t><t>and it shall be devoured; <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>I will break down its wall, </t><t>and it shall be trampled down.</t>
Isaiah 5-6 <t>I will make it a waste; </t><t>it shall not be pruned or hoed, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>briers and thorns shall grow up; </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>I will also command the clouds </t><t>that they rain no rain upon it. </t>
Isaiah 5-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts </t><t>is the house of Israel, </t><t>and the men of Judah </t><t>are his pleasant planting; </t><t>and he looked for justice, </t><t>but behold, bloodshed; <f>[2]</f> </t><t>for righteousness, </t><t>but behold, an outcry! <f>[3]</f> </t>
Isaiah 5-8 <pb/><t>Woe to those who <f>ⓚ</f>join house to house, </t><t>who add field to field, </t><t>until there is no more room, </t><t>and you are made to dwell alone </t><t>in the midst of the land.</t>
Isaiah 5-9 <t>The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing: </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>“Surely many houses shall be desolate, </t><t>large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.</t>
Isaiah 5-10 <t><f>ⓜ</f> For ten acres <f>[4]</f> of vineyard shall yield but one bath, </t><t>and a <f>ⓝ</f>homer of seed shall yield but an ephah.” <f>[5]</f> </t>

Isaiah 5-12 <t><f>ⓟ</f> They have lyre and harp, </t><t>tambourine and flute and wine at their feasts, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>but they do not regard the deeds of the LORD, </t><t>or see the work of his hands. </t>
Isaiah 5-13 <pb/><t>Therefore my people go into exile </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>for lack of knowledge; <f>[6]</f> </t><t>their <f>ⓢ</f>honored men go hungry, <f>[7]</f> </t><t>and their multitude is parched with thirst.</t>
Isaiah 5-14 <t>Therefore Sheol has <f>ⓣ</f>enlarged its appetite </t><t>and opened <f>ⓤ</f>its mouth beyond measure, </t><t>and the nobility of Jerusalem <f>[8]</f> and her multitude will go down, </t><t>her revelers and he who <f>ⓥ</f>exults in her.</t>

Isaiah 5-17 <t>Then shall the lambs graze <f>ⓨ</f>as in their pasture, </t><t>and <f>ⓩ</f>nomads shall eat among the ruins of the rich. </t>
Isaiah 5-18 <pb/><t>Woe to those who draw iniquity with <f>ⓐ</f>cords of falsehood, </t><t>who draw sin as with cart ropes,</t>
Isaiah 5-19 <t>who say: <f>ⓑ</f>“Let him be quick, </t><t>let him speed his work </t><t>that we may see it; </t><t>let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near, </t><t>and let it come, that we may know it!”</t>
Isaiah 5-20 <t>Woe to <f>ⓒ</f>those who call evil good </t><t>and good evil, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>who put darkness for light </t><t>and light for darkness, </t><t>who put bitter for sweet </t><t>and sweet for bitter!</t>
Isaiah 5-21 <t>Woe to those who are <f>ⓔ</f>wise in their own eyes, </t><t>and shrewd in their own sight!</t>
Isaiah 5-22 <t>Woe to those who are <f>ⓕ</f>heroes at drinking wine, </t><t>and valiant men in mixing strong drink,</t>

Isaiah 5-24 <pb/><t>Therefore, <f>ⓗ</f>as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, </t><t>and as dry grass sinks down in the flame, </t><t>so <f>ⓘ</f>their root will be <f>ⓙ</f>as rottenness, </t><t>and their blossom go up like dust; </t><t>for they have <f>ⓚ</f>rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, </t><t>and have <f>ⓛ</f>despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</t>
Isaiah 5-25 <t>Therefore <f>ⓜ</f>the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, </t><t>and he stretched out his hand against them and struck them, </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>the mountains quaked; </t><t>and their corpses were <f>ⓞ</f>as refuse </t><t>in the midst of the streets. </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>For all this his anger has not turned away, </t><t>and his hand is stretched out still. </t>
Isaiah 5-26 <pb/><t>He will <f>ⓠ</f>raise a signal for nations far away, </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>whistle for them <f>ⓢ</f>from the ends of the earth; </t><t>and behold, quickly, speedily they come!</t>
Isaiah 5-27 <t><f>ⓣ</f> None is weary, none stumbles, </t><t>none slumbers or sleeps, </t><t>not a waistband is loose, </t><t>not a sandal strap broken;</t>
Isaiah 5-28 <t><f>ⓤ</f> their arrows are sharp, </t><t>all their bows bent, </t><t>their horses' hoofs seem like flint, </t><t>and their wheels <f>ⓥ</f>like the whirlwind.</t>

Isaiah 5-30 <t>They will growl over it on that day, </t><t>like the growling of the sea. </t><t>And if one looks to the land, </t><t>behold, <f>ⓧ</f>darkness and distress; </t><t>and the light is darkened by its clouds. </t>
Romans 3-1 <pb/>Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?
Romans 3-2 Much in every way. To begin with, <f>ⓐ</f>the Jews were entrusted with <f>ⓑ</f>the oracles of God.
Romans 3-3 <f>ⓒ</f> What if some were unfaithful? <f>ⓓ</f>Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?
Romans 3-4 By no means! <f>ⓔ</f>Let God be true though <f>ⓕ</f>every one were a liar, as it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“That you may be justified in your words, </t><t>and prevail when you <f>ⓗ</f>are judged.” </t>
Romans 3-5 <pb/>But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict <f>ⓘ</f>wrath on us? (<f>ⓙ</f>I speak in a human way.)
Romans 3-6 By no means! For then how could <f>ⓚ</f>God judge the world?
Romans 3-7 But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, <f>ⓛ</f>why am I still being condemned as a sinner?
Romans 3-8 And why not <f>ⓜ</f>do evil that good may come? — as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.
Romans 3-9 <pb/>What then? Are we Jews <f>[1]</f> any better off? <f>[2]</f> No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both <f>ⓝ</f>Jews and <f>ⓞ</f>Greeks, are <f>ⓟ</f>under sin,
Romans 3-10 as it is written: <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f>“None is righteous, no, not one;</t>
Romans 3-11 <t>no one understands; </t><t>no one seeks for God.</t>
Romans 3-12 <t>All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; </t><t>no one does good, </t><t>not even one.”</t>
Romans 3-13 <t><f>ⓡ</f> “Their throat is <f>ⓢ</f>an open grave; </t><t>they use their tongues to deceive.” </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>“The venom of asps is under their lips.”</t>
Romans 3-14 <t><f>ⓤ</f> “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”</t>
Romans 3-15 <t><f>ⓥ</f> “Their feet are swift to shed blood;</t>
Romans 3-16 <t>in their paths are ruin and misery,</t>
Romans 3-17 <t>and <f>ⓦ</f>the way of peace they have not known.”</t>
Romans 3-18 <t><f>ⓧ</f> “There is no fear of God before their eyes.” </t>
Romans 3-19 <pb/>Now we know that whatever <f>ⓨ</f>the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, <f>ⓩ</f>so that every mouth may be stopped, and <f>ⓐ</f>the whole world may be held accountable to God.
Romans 3-20 For <f>ⓑ</f>by works of the law no human being <f>[3]</f> will be justified in his sight, since <f>ⓒ</f>through the law comes knowledge of sin.
Romans 3-21 <pb/>But now <f>ⓓ</f>the righteousness of God <f>ⓔ</f>has been manifested apart from the law, although <f>ⓕ</f>the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it —
Romans 3-22 the righteousness of God <f>ⓖ</f>through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. <f>ⓗ</f>For there is no distinction:
Romans 3-23 for <f>ⓘ</f>all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
Romans 3-24 <f>ⓙ</f> and are justified <f>ⓚ</f>by his grace as a gift, <f>ⓛ</f>through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
Romans 3-25 whom God <f>ⓜ</f>put forward as <f>ⓝ</f>a propitiation <f>ⓞ</f>by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in <f>ⓟ</f>his divine forbearance he had passed over <f>ⓠ</f>former sins.
Romans 3-26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
Romans 3-27 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.
Romans 3-28 For we hold that one is justified by faith <f>ⓢ</f>apart from works of the law.
Romans 3-29 Or <f>ⓣ</f>is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
Romans 3-30 since <f>ⓤ</f>God is one — who will justify the circumcised by faith and <f>ⓥ</f>the uncircumcised through faith.
Romans 3-31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
