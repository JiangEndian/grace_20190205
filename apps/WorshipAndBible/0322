Genesis 26-1 <pb/>Now there was a famine in the land, besides <f>ⓐ</f>the former famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Gerar to <f>ⓑ</f>Abimelech king of the <f>ⓒ</f>Philistines.
Genesis 26-2 And the LORD appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; dwell <f>ⓓ</f>in the land of which I shall tell you.
Genesis 26-3 <f>ⓔ</f> Sojourn in this land, and <f>ⓕ</f>I will be with you and will bless you, for <f>ⓖ</f>to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will establish <f>ⓗ</f>the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.
Genesis 26-4 <f>ⓘ</f> I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all these lands. And <f>ⓙ</f>in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,
Genesis 26-5 because <f>ⓚ</f>Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”
Genesis 26-6 <pb/>So Isaac settled in Gerar.
Genesis 26-7 When the men of the place asked him about his wife, <f>ⓛ</f>he said, “She is my sister,” for <f>ⓜ</f>he feared to say, “My wife,” thinking, “lest the men of the place should kill me because of Rebekah,” because <f>ⓝ</f>she was attractive in appearance.
Genesis 26-8 When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac laughing with <f>[1]</f> Rebekah his wife.
Genesis 26-9 So Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Behold, she is your wife. How then could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I thought, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”
Genesis 26-10 Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and <f>ⓞ</f>you would have brought guilt upon us.”
Genesis 26-11 So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”
Genesis 26-12 <pb/>And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The LORD <f>ⓟ</f>blessed him,
Genesis 26-13 and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy.
Genesis 26-14 He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines <f>ⓠ</f>envied him.
Genesis 26-15 (Now the Philistines had stopped and filled with earth all the wells <f>ⓡ</f>that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father.)
Genesis 26-16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”
Genesis 26-17 <pb/>So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.
Genesis 26-18 And Isaac dug again the wells of water that had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, which the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham. And <f>ⓢ</f>he gave them the names that his father had given them.
Genesis 26-19 But when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of spring water,
Genesis 26-20 the herdsmen of Gerar <f>ⓣ</f>quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, <f>[2]</f> because they contended with him.
Genesis 26-21 Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah. <f>[3]</f>
Genesis 26-22 And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, <f>[4]</f> saying, “For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.”
Genesis 26-23 <pb/>From there he went up to Beersheba.
Genesis 26-24 And the LORD appeared to him the same night and said, <f>ⓤ</f>“I am the God of Abraham your father. <f>ⓥ</f>Fear not, for <f>ⓦ</f>I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake.”
Genesis 26-25 So he <f>ⓧ</f>built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.
Genesis 26-26 <pb/>When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and <f>ⓨ</f>Phicol the commander of his army,
Genesis 26-27 Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and <f>ⓩ</f>have sent me away from you?”
Genesis 26-28 They said, “We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,
Genesis 26-29 that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. <f>ⓐ</f>You are now the blessed of the LORD.”
Genesis 26-30 So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
Genesis 26-31 In the morning they rose early and <f>ⓑ</f>exchanged oaths. And Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis 26-32 That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, “We have found water.”
Genesis 26-33 He called it Shibah; <f>[5]</f> therefore the name of the city is <f>ⓒ</f>Beersheba to this day.
Genesis 26-34 <pb/>When Esau was forty years old, he took <f>ⓓ</f>Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,
Genesis 26-35 and <f>ⓔ</f>they made life bitter <f>[6]</f> for Isaac and Rebekah.
2 Chronicles 24-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Joash <f>[1]</f> was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2 Chronicles 24-2 <f>ⓑ</f> And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
2 Chronicles 24-3 Jehoiada got for him two wives, and he had sons and daughters.
2 Chronicles 24-4 <pb/>After this Joash <f>ⓒ</f>decided to <f>ⓓ</f>restore the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 24-5 And he gathered the priests and the Levites and said to them, “Go out to the cities of <f>ⓔ</f>Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you act quickly.” But the Levites did not act quickly.
2 Chronicles 24-6 So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief and said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem <f>ⓕ</f>the tax levied by Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the congregation of Israel for <f>ⓖ</f>the tent of testimony?”
2 Chronicles 24-7 For <f>ⓗ</f>the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also used all <f>ⓘ</f>the dedicated things of the house of the LORD for the Baals.
2 Chronicles 24-8 <pb/>So the king commanded, and they made a chest and set it outside the gate of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 24-9 And <f>ⓙ</f>proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in for the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles 24-10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought their tax and dropped it into the chest until they had finished. <f>[2]</f>
2 Chronicles 24-11 And whenever the chest was brought to the king's officers by the Levites, when they saw that there was much money in it, the king's secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and take it and return it to its place. Thus they did day after day, and collected money in abundance.
2 Chronicles 24-12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who had charge of the work of the house of the LORD, and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the LORD, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 24-13 So those who were engaged in the work labored, and the repairing went forward in their hands, and they restored the house of God to its proper condition and strengthened it.
2 Chronicles 24-14 And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, and with it <f>ⓛ</f>were made utensils for the house of the LORD, both for the service and for the burnt offerings, and dishes for incense and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD regularly all the days of Jehoiada.
2 Chronicles 24-15 <pb/>But Jehoiada grew old and full of days, and died. He was 130 years old at his death.
2 Chronicles 24-16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.
2 Chronicles 24-17 <pb/>Now after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and paid homage to the king. Then the king listened to them.
2 Chronicles 24-18 And they abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and served <f>ⓜ</f>the Asherim and the idols. And <f>ⓝ</f>wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.
2 Chronicles 24-19 <f>ⓞ</f> Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to the LORD. <f>ⓟ</f>These testified against them, but they would not pay attention.
2 Chronicles 24-20 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah <f>ⓡ</f>the son of Jehoiada the priest, and he stood above the people, and said to them, “Thus says God, <f>ⓢ</f>‘Why do you break the commandments of the LORD, so that you cannot prosper? <f>ⓣ</f>Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has forsaken you.’”
2 Chronicles 24-21 But <f>ⓤ</f>they conspired against him, <f>ⓥ</f>and by command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 24-22 Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness that Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, had shown him, but killed his son. And when he was dying, he said, “May the LORD see <f>ⓦ</f>and avenge!” <f>[3]</f>
2 Chronicles 24-23 <pb/>At the end of the year <f>ⓧ</f>the army of the Syrians came up against Joash. They came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.
2 Chronicles 24-24 Though the army of the Syrians had come with few men, <f>ⓨ</f>the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army, <f>ⓩ</f>because Judah <f>[4]</f> had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. Thus they <f>ⓐ</f>executed judgment on Joash.
2 Chronicles 24-25 <pb/>When they had departed from him, leaving him <f>ⓑ</f>severely wounded, <f>ⓒ</f>his servants conspired against him because of the blood of <f>ⓓ</f>the son <f>[5]</f> of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, <f>ⓔ</f>but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.
2 Chronicles 24-26 Those who conspired against him were Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonite, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabite.
2 Chronicles 24-27 Accounts of his sons and of the many oracles against him and of <f>ⓕ</f>the rebuilding <f>[6]</f> of the house of God are written in the <f>ⓖ</f>Story <f>[7]</f> of the Book of the Kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
Jeremiah 11-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 11-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 11-3 You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: <f>ⓑ</f>Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant
Jeremiah 11-4 that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, <f>ⓒ</f>from the iron furnace, saying, <f>ⓓ</f>Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. <f>ⓔ</f>So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,
Jeremiah 11-5 <f>ⓕ</f> that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, <f>ⓖ</f>to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.” Then I answered, “So be it, LORD.”
Jeremiah 11-6 <pb/>And the LORD said to me, <f>ⓗ</f>“Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: <f>ⓘ</f>Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
Jeremiah 11-7 For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, <f>ⓙ</f>warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, <f>ⓚ</f>Obey my voice.
Jeremiah 11-8 <f>ⓛ</f> Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, <f>ⓜ</f>but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all <f>ⓝ</f>the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.”
Jeremiah 11-9 <pb/>Again the LORD said to me, <f>ⓞ</f>“A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah 11-10 They have turned back to <f>ⓟ</f>the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. <f>ⓠ</f>They have gone after other gods to serve them. <f>ⓡ</f>The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers.
Jeremiah 11-11 Therefore, thus says the LORD, Behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. <f>ⓢ</f>Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them.
Jeremiah 11-12 Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem <f>ⓣ</f>will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, <f>ⓤ</f>but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble.
Jeremiah 11-13 <f>ⓥ</f> For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, <f>ⓦ</f>altars to make offerings to Baal.
Jeremiah 11-14 <pb/>“Therefore <f>ⓧ</f>do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, <f>ⓨ</f>for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.
Jeremiah 11-15 <f>ⓩ</f> What right has my beloved in my house, <f>ⓐ</f>when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? <f>ⓑ</f>Can you then exult?
Jeremiah 11-16 The LORD once called you <f>ⓒ</f>‘a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.’ But <f>ⓓ</f>with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and <f>ⓔ</f>its branches will be consumed.
Jeremiah 11-17 The LORD of hosts, <f>ⓕ</f>who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, <f>ⓖ</f>provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal.”
Jeremiah 11-18 <pb/><t>The LORD made it known to me and I knew; </t><t>then you showed me their deeds.</t>
Jeremiah 11-19 <t>But I was <f>ⓗ</f>like a gentle lamb </t><t>led to the slaughter. </t><t>I did not know <f>ⓘ</f>it was against me </t><t>they devised schemes, saying, </t><t>“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>let us cut him off from <f>ⓚ</f>the land of the living, </t><t>that his name be remembered no more.”</t>
Jeremiah 11-20 <t>But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, </t><t>who <f>ⓛ</f>tests <f>ⓜ</f>the heart and the mind, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>let me see your vengeance upon them, </t><t>for to you have I committed my cause. </t>
Jeremiah 11-21 <pb/>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of <f>ⓞ</f>Anathoth, <f>ⓟ</f>who seek your life, and say, <f>ⓠ</f>“Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand” —
Jeremiah 11-22 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: “Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,
Jeremiah 11-23 and none of them shall be left. For I will bring disaster upon the men of <f>ⓡ</f>Anathoth, <f>ⓢ</f>the year of their punishment.”
1 Timothy 3-1 <pb/>The saying is <f>ⓐ</f>trustworthy: If anyone aspires to <f>ⓑ</f>the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.
1 Timothy 3-2 Therefore <f>ⓒ</f>an overseer <f>[1]</f> must be above reproach, <f>ⓓ</f>the husband of one wife, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, <f>ⓕ</f>hospitable, <f>ⓖ</f>able to teach,
1 Timothy 3-3 not a drunkard, not violent but <f>ⓗ</f>gentle, not quarrelsome, <f>ⓘ</f>not a lover of money.
1 Timothy 3-4 He must manage his own household well, with all dignity <f>ⓙ</f>keeping his children submissive,
1 Timothy 3-5 for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for <f>ⓚ</f>God's church?
1 Timothy 3-6 He must not be a recent convert, or he may <f>ⓛ</f>become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
1 Timothy 3-7 Moreover, he must be well thought of by <f>ⓜ</f>outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into <f>ⓝ</f>a snare of the devil.
1 Timothy 3-8 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>not addicted to much wine, <f>ⓠ</f>not greedy for dishonest gain.
1 Timothy 3-9 They must <f>ⓡ</f>hold the mystery of the faith with <f>ⓢ</f>a clear conscience.
1 Timothy 3-10 And <f>ⓣ</f>let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.
1 Timothy 3-11 <f>ⓤ</f> Their wives likewise <f>[4]</f> must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, <f>ⓥ</f>faithful in all things.
1 Timothy 3-12 Let deacons each be <f>ⓦ</f>the husband of one wife, <f>ⓧ</f>managing their children and their own households well.
1 Timothy 3-13 For <f>ⓨ</f>those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy 3-14 <pb/>I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that,
1 Timothy 3-15 if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth.
1 Timothy 3-16 Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f>He <f>[5]</f> was manifested in the flesh, </t><t>vindicated <f>[6]</f> by the Spirit, <f>[7]</f> </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>seen by angels, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>proclaimed among the nations, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>believed on in the world, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>taken up in glory. </t>
