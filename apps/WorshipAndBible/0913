14-1 <pb/>These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which <f>ⓐ</f>Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit.
14-2 Their inheritance was <f>ⓑ</f>by lot, just as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine and one-half tribes.
14-3 <f>ⓒ</f> For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan, <f>ⓓ</f>but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
14-4 For <f>ⓔ</f>the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance.
14-5 The people of Israel did <f>ⓕ</f>as the LORD commanded Moses; they allotted the land.
14-6 <pb/>Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the <f>ⓖ</f>Kenizzite said to him, “You know <f>ⓗ</f>what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me.
14-7 I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD <f>ⓘ</f>sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
14-8 But <f>ⓙ</f>my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the LORD my God.
14-9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, <f>ⓚ</f>‘Surely the land <f>ⓛ</f>on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.’
14-10 And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, <f>ⓜ</f>just as he said, these <f>ⓝ</f>forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day <f>ⓞ</f>eighty-five years old.
14-11 <f>ⓟ</f> I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and <f>ⓠ</f>for going and coming.
14-12 So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day how the <f>ⓡ</f>Anakim were there, with great fortified cities. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the LORD said.”
14-13 <pb/>Then Joshua <f>ⓢ</f>blessed him, and he gave <f>ⓣ</f>Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
14-14 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, <f>ⓤ</f>because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.
14-15 <f>ⓥ</f> Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba. <f>[1]</f> (Arba <f>[2]</f> was the greatest man among the Anakim.) <f>ⓦ</f>And the land had rest from war.
88-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f> <f>ⓒ</f> <pb/><t>O LORD, <f>ⓓ</f>God of my salvation, </t><t>I <f>ⓔ</f>cry out day and night before you.</t>
88-2 <t>Let my prayer come before you; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>incline your ear to my cry! </t>
88-3 <pb/><t>For my soul is full of troubles, </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>my life draws near to <f>ⓗ</f>Sheol.</t>
88-4 <t>I am counted among those who <f>ⓘ</f>go down to the pit; </t><t>I am a man who has no strength,</t>
88-5 <t>like one set loose among the dead, </t><t>like the slain that lie in the grave, </t><t>like those whom <f>ⓙ</f>you remember no more, </t><t>for they are <f>ⓚ</f>cut off from your hand.</t>
88-6 <t>You have put me in <f>ⓛ</f>the depths of the pit, </t><t>in the <f>ⓜ</f>regions dark and <f>ⓝ</f>deep.</t>
88-7 <t>Your wrath <f>ⓞ</f>lies heavy upon me, </t><t>and you overwhelm me with <f>ⓟ</f>all your waves. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
88-8 <pb/><t>You have caused <f>ⓠ</f>my companions to shun me; </t><t>you have made me <f>ⓡ</f>a horror <f>[2]</f> to them. </t><t>I am <f>ⓢ</f>shut in so that I cannot escape;</t>
88-9 <t><f>ⓣ</f> my eye grows dim through sorrow. </t><t>Every day I call upon you, O LORD; </t><t>I <f>ⓤ</f>spread out my hands to you.</t>
88-10 <t>Do you work wonders for the dead? </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>Do the departed rise up to praise you? <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
88-11 <t>Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, </t><t>or your faithfulness in Abaddon?</t>
88-12 <t>Are your <f>ⓦ</f>wonders known in <f>ⓧ</f>the darkness, </t><t>or your righteousness in the land of <f>ⓨ</f>forgetfulness? </t>
88-13 <pb/><t>But I, O LORD, cry <f>ⓩ</f>to you; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>in the morning my prayer comes before you.</t>
88-14 <t>O LORD, why <f>ⓑ</f>do you cast my soul away? </t><t>Why <f>ⓒ</f>do you hide your face from me?</t>
88-15 <t>Afflicted and close to death from my youth up, </t><t>I suffer your terrors; I am helpless. <f>[3]</f></t>
88-16 <t>Your wrath has swept over me; </t><t>your <f>ⓓ</f>dreadful assaults destroy me.</t>
88-17 <t>They <f>ⓔ</f>surround me like a flood <f>ⓕ</f>all day long; </t><t>they <f>ⓖ</f>close in on me together.</t>
88-18 <t>You have caused <f>ⓗ</f>my beloved and my friend to shun me; </t><t>my companions have become darkness. <f>[4]</f> </t>
2-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>after Jesus was born in <f>ⓑ</f>Bethlehem of Judea <f>ⓒ</f>in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men <f>[1]</f> from <f>ⓓ</f>the east came to Jerusalem,
2-2 saying, “Where is he who has been born <f>ⓔ</f>king of the Jews? For we saw <f>ⓕ</f>his star when it rose <f>[2]</f> and have come to <f>ⓖ</f>worship him.”
2-3 When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;
2-4 and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where <f>ⓗ</f>the Christ was to be born.
2-5 They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
2-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> “‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, </t><t>are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; </t><t>for from you shall come a ruler </t><t>who will <f>ⓙ</f>shepherd my people Israel.’” </t>
2-7 <pb/>Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared.
2-8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.”
2-9 After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
2-10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
2-11 And going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, <f>ⓚ</f>they offered him gifts, <f>ⓛ</f>gold and <f>ⓜ</f>frankincense and <f>ⓝ</f>myrrh.
2-12 And <f>ⓞ</f>being warned <f>ⓟ</f>in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.
2-13 <pb/>Now when they had departed, behold, <f>ⓠ</f>an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”
2-14 And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt
2-15 and remained there until the death of Herod. <f>ⓡ</f>This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, <f>ⓢ</f>“Out of Egypt I called my son.”
2-16 <pb/>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.
2-17 <f>ⓣ</f> Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
2-18 <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f> “A voice was heard in Ramah, </t><t>weeping and loud lamentation, </t><t>Rachel weeping for her children; </t><t>she refused to be comforted, because they <f>ⓥ</f>are no more.” </t>
2-19 <pb/>But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
2-20 saying, “Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for <f>ⓦ</f>those who sought the child's life are dead.”
2-21 And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
2-22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and <f>ⓧ</f>being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
2-23 And he went and lived in a city called <f>ⓨ</f>Nazareth, <f>ⓩ</f>so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.
