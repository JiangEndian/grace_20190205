Genesis 50-1 <pb/>Then Joseph <f>ⓐ</f>fell on his father's face and wept over him and kissed him.
Genesis 50-2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to <f>ⓑ</f>embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis 50-3 Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians <f>ⓒ</f>wept for him seventy days.
Genesis 50-4 <pb/>And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, <f>ⓓ</f>“If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
Genesis 50-5 ‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die: in my tomb <f>ⓔ</f>that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.” Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.’”
Genesis 50-6 And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.”
Genesis 50-7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
Genesis 50-8 as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left <f>ⓕ</f>in the land of Goshen.
Genesis 50-9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
Genesis 50-10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, <f>ⓖ</f>they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he <f>ⓗ</f>made a mourning for his father seven days.
Genesis 50-11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; <f>[1]</f> it is beyond the Jordan.
Genesis 50-12 Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them,
Genesis 50-13 for <f>ⓘ</f>his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham <f>ⓙ</f>bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place.
Genesis 50-14 After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.
Genesis 50-15 <pb/>When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.”
Genesis 50-16 So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died:
Genesis 50-17 ‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of <f>ⓚ</f>the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
Genesis 50-18 His brothers also came and <f>ⓛ</f>fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.”
Genesis 50-19 But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for <f>ⓜ</f>am I in the place of God?
Genesis 50-20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but <f>ⓝ</f>God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people <f>[2]</f> should be kept alive, as they are today.
Genesis 50-21 So do not fear; <f>ⓞ</f>I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.
Genesis 50-22 <pb/>So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father's house. Joseph lived 110 years.
Genesis 50-23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children <f>ⓟ</f>of the third generation. The <f>ⓠ</f>children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were <f>ⓡ</f>counted as Joseph's own. <f>[3]</f>
Genesis 50-24 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but <f>ⓢ</f>God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land <f>ⓣ</f>that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
Genesis 50-25 Then <f>ⓤ</f>Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”
Genesis 50-26 So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They <f>ⓥ</f>embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
Nehemiah 2-1 <pb/>In the month of Nisan, <f>ⓐ</f>in the twentieth year of King <f>ⓑ</f>Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, <f>ⓒ</f>I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence.
Nehemiah 2-2 And the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing but <f>ⓓ</f>sadness of the heart.” Then I was very much afraid.
Nehemiah 2-3 I said to the king, <f>ⓔ</f>“Let the king live forever! Why should not my face be sad, <f>ⓕ</f>when the city, the place of my fathers' graves, lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”
Nehemiah 2-4 Then the king said to me, “What are you requesting?” So I prayed <f>ⓖ</f>to the God of heaven.
Nehemiah 2-5 And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' graves, that I may rebuild it.”
Nehemiah 2-6 And the king said to me (<f>ⓗ</f>the queen sitting beside him), “How long will you be gone, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me <f>ⓘ</f>when I had given him a time.
Nehemiah 2-7 And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me <f>ⓙ</f>to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah,
Nehemiah 2-8 and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of <f>ⓚ</f>the fortress of the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.” And the king granted me what I asked, <f>ⓛ</f>for the good hand of my God was upon me.
Nehemiah 2-9 <pb/>Then I came to <f>ⓜ</f>the governors of the province Beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
Nehemiah 2-10 But when <f>ⓝ</f>Sanballat the Horonite and <f>ⓞ</f>Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard this, it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel.
Nehemiah 2-11 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> So I went to Jerusalem and was there three days.
Nehemiah 2-12 Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. And I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me but the one on which I rode.
Nehemiah 2-13 I went out by night by <f>ⓠ</f>the Valley Gate to the Dragon Spring and to <f>ⓡ</f>the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem <f>ⓢ</f>that were broken down <f>ⓣ</f>and its gates that had been destroyed by fire.
Nehemiah 2-14 Then I went on to <f>ⓤ</f>the Fountain Gate and to <f>ⓥ</f>the King's Pool, but there was no room for the animal that was under me to pass.
Nehemiah 2-15 Then I went up in the night <f>ⓦ</f>by the valley and inspected the wall, and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.
Nehemiah 2-16 And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest who were to do the work.
Nehemiah 2-17 <pb/>Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in, <f>ⓧ</f>how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer <f>ⓨ</f>suffer derision.”
Nehemiah 2-18 And I told them <f>ⓩ</f>of the hand of my God that had been upon me for good, and also of the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said, “Let us rise up and build.” <f>ⓐ</f>So they strengthened their hands for the good work.
Nehemiah 2-19 But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and <f>ⓑ</f>Geshem the Arab heard of it, <f>ⓒ</f>they jeered at us and despised us and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? <f>ⓓ</f>Are you rebelling against the king?”
Nehemiah 2-20 Then I replied to them, <f>ⓔ</f>“The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we his servants will arise and build, but you have no portion or right or claim <f>[1]</f> in Jerusalem.”
Jeremiah 35-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of <f>ⓐ</f>Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
Jeremiah 35-2 “Go to the house of the <f>ⓑ</f>Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to the house of the LORD, into one of <f>ⓒ</f>the chambers; then offer them wine to drink.”
Jeremiah 35-3 So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites.
Jeremiah 35-4 I brought them to the house of the LORD into <f>ⓓ</f>the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, <f>ⓔ</f>the man of God, which was near <f>ⓕ</f>the chamber of the officials, above <f>ⓖ</f>the chamber of <f>ⓗ</f>Maaseiah the son of Shallum, <f>ⓘ</f>keeper of the threshold.
Jeremiah 35-5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.”
Jeremiah 35-6 But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for <f>ⓙ</f>Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons forever.
Jeremiah 35-7 You shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, <f>ⓚ</f>that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’
Jeremiah 35-8 We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,
Jeremiah 35-9 and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed,
Jeremiah 35-10 but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
Jeremiah 35-11 But <f>ⓛ</f>when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of <f>ⓜ</f>the army of the Chaldeans and <f>ⓝ</f>the army of the Syrians.’ <f>ⓞ</f>So we are living in Jerusalem.”
Jeremiah 35-12 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
Jeremiah 35-13 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <f>ⓟ</f>Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the LORD.
Jeremiah 35-14 The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you <f>ⓠ</f>persistently, but you have not listened to me.
Jeremiah 35-15 I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them <f>ⓡ</f>persistently, saying, <f>ⓢ</f>‘Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and <f>ⓣ</f>do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers.’ <f>ⓤ</f>But you did not incline your ear or listen to me.
Jeremiah 35-16 The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.
Jeremiah 35-17 Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, <f>ⓥ</f>because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, <f>ⓦ</f>I have called to them and they have not answered.”
Jeremiah 35-18 <pb/>But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you,
Jeremiah 35-19 therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man <f>ⓧ</f>to stand before me.”
Hebrews 13-1 <pb/>Let <f>ⓐ</f>brotherly love continue.
Hebrews 13-2 <f>ⓑ</f> Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby <f>ⓒ</f>some have entertained angels unawares.
Hebrews 13-3 <f>ⓓ</f> Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.
Hebrews 13-4 <f>ⓔ</f> Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge <f>ⓕ</f>the sexually immoral and adulterous.
Hebrews 13-5 Keep your life <f>ⓖ</f>free from love of money, and <f>ⓗ</f>be content with what you have, for he has said, <f>ⓘ</f>“I will never leave you nor forsake you.”
Hebrews 13-6 So we can confidently say, <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f>“The Lord is my helper; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>I will not fear; </t><t>what can man do to me?” </t>
Hebrews 13-7 <pb/>Remember <f>ⓛ</f>your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and <f>ⓜ</f>imitate their faith.
Hebrews 13-8 Jesus Christ is <f>ⓝ</f>the same yesterday and today and forever.
Hebrews 13-9 Do not be <f>ⓞ</f>led away by diverse and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, <f>ⓟ</f>not by foods, which have not benefited those devoted to them.
Hebrews 13-10 We have an altar <f>ⓠ</f>from which those who serve the tent <f>[1]</f> have no right to eat.
Hebrews 13-11 For <f>ⓡ</f>the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned <f>ⓢ</f>outside the camp.
Hebrews 13-12 So Jesus also <f>ⓣ</f>suffered <f>ⓤ</f>outside the gate in order to sanctify the people <f>ⓥ</f>through his own blood.
Hebrews 13-13 Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear <f>ⓦ</f>the reproach he endured.
Hebrews 13-14 For <f>ⓧ</f>here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come.
Hebrews 13-15 <f>ⓨ</f> Through him then let us continually offer up <f>ⓩ</f>a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, <f>ⓐ</f>the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.
Hebrews 13-16 Do not neglect to do good and <f>ⓑ</f>to share what you have, for such <f>ⓒ</f>sacrifices are pleasing to God.
Hebrews 13-17 <pb/>Obey <f>ⓓ</f>your leaders and submit to them, <f>ⓔ</f>for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to <f>ⓕ</f>give an account. <f>ⓖ</f>Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.
Hebrews 13-18 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things.
Hebrews 13-19 I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order <f>ⓘ</f>that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Hebrews 13-20 <pb/>Now <f>ⓙ</f>may the God of peace <f>ⓚ</f>who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, <f>ⓛ</f>the great shepherd of the sheep, by <f>ⓜ</f>the blood of the eternal covenant,

Hebrews 13-22 <pb/>I appeal to you, brothers, <f>[3]</f> bear with my word of exhortation, for <f>ⓠ</f>I have written to you briefly.
Hebrews 13-23 You should know that <f>ⓡ</f>our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you if he comes soon.
Hebrews 13-24 Greet all <f>ⓢ</f>your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.
Hebrews 13-25 <f>ⓣ</f> Grace be with all of you.
