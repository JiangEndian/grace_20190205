16-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was <f>ⓑ</f>Hagar.
16-2 And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children <f>[1]</f> by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
16-3 So, after Abram <f>ⓒ</f>had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.
16-4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, <f>ⓓ</f>she looked with contempt on her mistress. <f>[2]</f>
16-5 And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD judge between you and me!”
16-6 But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her.
16-7 <pb/>The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to <f>ⓕ</f>Shur.
16-8 And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.”
16-9 The angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her.”
16-10 The angel of the LORD also said to her, <f>ⓖ</f>“I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.”
16-11 And the angel of the LORD said to her, <pb/><t>“Behold, you are pregnant </t><t>and shall bear a son. </t><t>You shall call his name Ishmael, <f>[3]</f> </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>because the LORD has listened to your affliction.</t>
16-12 <t>He shall be <f>ⓘ</f>a wild donkey of a man, </t><t>his hand against everyone </t><t>and everyone's hand against him, </t><t>and he shall dwell <f>ⓙ</f>over against all his kinsmen.” </t>
16-13 <pb/>So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God of seeing,” <f>[4]</f> for she said, <f>ⓚ</f>“Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.” <f>[5]</f>
16-14 Therefore the well was called <f>ⓛ</f>Beer-lahai-roi; <f>[6]</f> it lies between <f>ⓜ</f>Kadesh and Bered.
16-15 <pb/>And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
16-16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
14-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land had rest for ten years.
14-2 <f>[2]</f> And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
14-3 He took away the foreign altars <f>ⓑ</f>and the high places and broke down <f>ⓒ</f>the pillars and cut down the <f>ⓓ</f>Asherim
14-4 and commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to keep the law and the commandment.
14-5 He also took out of all the cities of Judah <f>ⓔ</f>the high places and the <f>ⓕ</f>incense altars. And the kingdom had rest under him.
14-6 He built <f>ⓖ</f>fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. He had no war in those years, <f>ⓗ</f>for the LORD gave him peace.
14-7 And he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with <f>ⓘ</f>walls and towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought him, <f>ⓙ</f>and he has given us peace on every side.” So they built and prospered.
14-8 And Asa had an army of <f>ⓚ</f>300,000 from Judah, armed with large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin that carried shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor.
14-9 <pb/>Zerah <f>ⓛ</f>the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and 300 chariots, and came as far as <f>ⓜ</f>Mareshah.
14-10 And Asa went out to meet him, and <f>ⓝ</f>they drew up their lines of battle in the Valley of Zephathah at <f>ⓞ</f>Mareshah.
14-11 And Asa <f>ⓟ</f>cried to the LORD his God, “O LORD, there is none like you to help, between the mighty and the weak. Help us, O LORD our God, <f>ⓠ</f>for we rely on you, <f>ⓡ</f>and in your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let not man prevail against you.”
14-12 <f>ⓢ</f> So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
14-13 Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as <f>ⓣ</f>Gerar, and the Ethiopians fell until none remained alive, for they were broken before the LORD and his army. The men of Judah <f>[3]</f> carried away very much spoil.
14-14 And they attacked all the cities around <f>ⓤ</f>Gerar, <f>ⓥ</f>for the fear of the LORD was upon them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them.
14-15 And they struck down the tents of those who had livestock and carried away sheep in abundance and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
1-1 <pb/>The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one <f>ⓐ</f>of the priests who were in <f>ⓑ</f>Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
1-2 to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of <f>ⓒ</f>Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in <f>ⓓ</f>the thirteenth year of his reign.
1-3 It came also in the days of <f>ⓔ</f>Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and <f>ⓕ</f>until the end of the eleventh year of <f>ⓖ</f>Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, <f>ⓗ</f>until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
1-4 <pb/>Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
1-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, </t><t>and before you were born <f>ⓙ</f>I consecrated you; </t><t>I appointed you a prophet <f>ⓚ</f>to the nations.” </t>
1-6 <pb/>Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, <f>ⓛ</f>I do not know how to speak, <f>ⓜ</f>for I am only a youth.”
1-7 But the LORD said to me, <pb/><t>“Do not say, ‘I am only a youth’; </t><t>for to all to whom I send you, you shall go, </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>whatever I command you, you shall speak.</t>
1-8 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Do not be afraid of them, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>for I am with you to deliver you, <pb/>declares the LORD.” </t>
1-9 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then the LORD put out his hand and <f>ⓡ</f>touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, <pb/><t>“Behold, I have put <f>ⓢ</f>my words in your mouth.</t>
1-10 <t>See, I have set you this day <f>ⓣ</f>over nations and over kingdoms, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>to pluck up and to break down, </t><t>to destroy and to overthrow, </t><t>to build and to plant.” </t>
1-11 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, <f>ⓥ</f>“Jeremiah, what do you see?” And I said, “I see an almond <f>[1]</f> branch.”
1-12 Then the LORD said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it.”
1-13 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see <f>ⓦ</f>a boiling pot, facing away <f>ⓧ</f>from the north.”
1-14 Then the LORD said to me, <f>ⓨ</f>“Out of the north disaster <f>[2]</f> shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land.
1-15 For behold, <f>ⓩ</f>I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, declares the LORD, <f>ⓐ</f>and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah.
1-16 And <f>ⓑ</f>I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil <f>ⓒ</f>in forsaking me. <f>ⓓ</f>They have made offerings to other gods and <f>ⓔ</f>worshiped the works of their own hands.
1-17 But you, <f>ⓕ</f>dress yourself for work; <f>[3]</f> arise, and <f>ⓖ</f>say to them everything that I command you. <f>ⓗ</f>Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them.
1-18 And I, behold, I make you this day <f>ⓘ</f>a fortified city, <f>ⓙ</f>an iron pillar, and <f>ⓚ</f>bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
1-19 <f>ⓛ</f> They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for <f>ⓜ</f>I am with you, declares the LORD, to deliver you.”
1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>Silvanus, and Timothy, <pb/>To the church of the <f>ⓑ</f>Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: <pb/><f>ⓒ</f>Grace to you and peace.
1-2 <pb/><f>ⓓ</f> We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>mentioning you in our prayers,
1-3 remembering before <f>ⓕ</f>our God and Father <f>ⓖ</f>your work of faith and labor of <f>ⓗ</f>love and <f>ⓘ</f>steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
1-4 For we know, <f>ⓙ</f>brothers <f>[2]</f> loved by God, <f>ⓚ</f>that he has chosen you,
1-5 because <f>ⓛ</f>our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and <f>ⓜ</f>in the Holy Spirit and with full <f>ⓝ</f>conviction. You know <f>ⓞ</f>what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.
1-6 And <f>ⓟ</f>you became imitators of us <f>ⓠ</f>and of the Lord, for <f>ⓡ</f>you received the word in much affliction, <f>ⓢ</f>with the <f>ⓣ</f>joy of the Holy Spirit,
1-7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
1-8 For not only has the word of the Lord <f>ⓤ</f>sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth <f>ⓥ</f>everywhere, so that we need not say anything.
1-9 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of <f>ⓦ</f>reception we had among you, and how <f>ⓧ</f>you turned to God <f>ⓨ</f>from idols to serve the living and <f>ⓩ</f>true God,
1-10 and <f>ⓐ</f>to wait for his Son <f>ⓑ</f>from heaven, <f>ⓒ</f>whom he raised from the dead, Jesus <f>ⓓ</f>who delivers us from <f>ⓔ</f>the wrath to come.
