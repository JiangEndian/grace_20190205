Genesis 25-19 <pb/>These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: <f>ⓥ</f>Abraham fathered Isaac,
Genesis 25-20 and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, <f>ⓦ</f>the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of <f>ⓧ</f>Paddan-aram, <f>ⓨ</f>the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife.
Genesis 25-21 And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And <f>ⓩ</f>the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
Genesis 25-22 The children struggled together within her, and she said, “If it is thus, why is this happening to me?” <f>[2]</f> So she went <f>ⓐ</f>to inquire of the LORD.
Genesis 25-23 And the LORD said to her, <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f>“Two nations are in your womb, </t><t>and two peoples from within you <f>[3]</f> shall be divided; </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>the one shall be stronger than the other, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>the older shall serve the younger.” </t>
Genesis 25-24 <pb/>When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis 25-25 The first came out red, <f>ⓔ</f>all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau.
Genesis 25-26 Afterward his brother came out with <f>ⓕ</f>his hand holding Esau's heel, so <f>ⓖ</f>his name was called Jacob. <f>[4]</f> Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
Genesis 25-27 <pb/>When the boys grew up, Esau was <f>ⓗ</f>a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, <f>ⓘ</f>dwelling in tents.
Genesis 25-28 Isaac loved Esau because <f>ⓙ</f>he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
Genesis 25-29 <pb/>Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.
Genesis 25-30 And Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted!” (Therefore his name was called Edom. <f>[5]</f>)
Genesis 25-31 Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright now.”
Genesis 25-32 Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?”
Genesis 25-33 Jacob said, “Swear to me now.” So he swore to him and <f>ⓚ</f>sold his birthright to Jacob.
Genesis 25-34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.

2 Chronicles 23-8 <pb/>The Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they each brought his men, who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss <f>ⓕ</f>the divisions.
2 Chronicles 23-9 And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains the spears and the large and small shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of God.
2 Chronicles 23-10 And he set all the people as a guard for the king, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house.
2 Chronicles 23-11 Then they brought out the king's son and put the crown on him and gave him <f>ⓖ</f>the testimony. And they proclaimed him king, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, <f>ⓗ</f>“Long live the king.”

2 Chronicles 23-14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains who were set over the army, saying to them, “Bring her out between the ranks, and anyone who follows her is to be put to death with the sword.” For the priest said, “Do not put her to death in the house of the LORD.”
2 Chronicles 23-15 So they laid hands on her, <f>[2]</f> and she went into the entrance of <f>ⓘ</f>the horse gate of the king's house, and they put her to death there.
2 Chronicles 23-16 <pb/>And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the LORD's people.

2 Chronicles 23-18 And Jehoiada posted watchmen for the house of the LORD under the direction of <f>ⓚ</f>the Levitical priests and the Levites <f>ⓛ</f>whom David had organized to be in charge of the house of the LORD, to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, <f>ⓜ</f>as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, <f>ⓝ</f>according to the order of David.
2 Chronicles 23-19 He stationed <f>ⓞ</f>the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD so that no one should enter who was in any way unclean.
2 Chronicles 23-20 And he took the captains, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD, marching <f>ⓟ</f>through the upper gate to the king's house. And they set the king on the royal throne.
2 Chronicles 23-21 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet after Athaliah had been put to death with the sword.

Jeremiah 10-2 Thus says the LORD: <pb/><t>“Learn not the way of the nations, </t><t>nor be dismayed at the signs of the heavens </t><t>because the nations are dismayed at them,</t>
Jeremiah 10-3 <t><f>ⓐ</f> for the customs of the peoples are vanity. <f>[1]</f> </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>A tree from the forest is cut down </t><t>and worked with an axe by the hands of a craftsman.</t>
Jeremiah 10-4 <t><f>ⓒ</f> They decorate it with silver and gold; </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>they fasten it with hammer and nails </t><t>so that it cannot move.</t>
Jeremiah 10-5 <t>Their idols <f>[2]</f> are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>they cannot speak; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>they have to be carried, </t><t>for they cannot walk. </t><t>Do not be afraid of them, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>for they cannot do evil, </t><t>neither is it in them to do good.” </t>
Jeremiah 10-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> There is none like you, O LORD; </t><t>you are great, and your name is great in might.</t>
Jeremiah 10-7 <t><f>ⓘ</f> Who would not fear you, O King of the nations? </t><t>For this is your due; </t><t>for among all the wise ones of the nations </t><t>and in all their kingdoms </t><t>there is none like you.</t>
Jeremiah 10-8 <t><f>ⓙ</f> They are both <f>ⓚ</f>stupid and foolish; </t><t>the instruction of idols is but wood!</t>
Jeremiah 10-9 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Beaten silver is brought from <f>ⓜ</f>Tarshish, </t><t>and gold from <f>ⓝ</f>Uphaz. </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; </t><t>their clothing is violet and purple; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>they are all the work of skilled men.</t>
Jeremiah 10-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> But the LORD is the true God; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>he is the living God and the everlasting King. </t><t>At his wrath the earth quakes, </t><t>and the nations cannot endure his indignation. </t>
Jeremiah 10-11 <pb/>Thus shall you say to them: <f>ⓢ</f>“The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth <f>ⓣ</f>shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.” <f>[3]</f>
Jeremiah 10-12 <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f> It is he who <f>ⓥ</f>made the earth by his power, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>who established the world by his wisdom, </t><t>and <f>ⓧ</f>by his understanding stretched out the heavens.</t>
Jeremiah 10-13 <t><f>ⓨ</f> When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>He makes lightning <f>ⓑ</f>for the rain, </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>and he brings forth the wind <f>ⓓ</f>from his storehouses.</t>
Jeremiah 10-14 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Every man is stupid and without knowledge; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, </t><t>for his images are false, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>and there is no breath in them.</t>
Jeremiah 10-15 <t>They are worthless, a work of delusion; </t><t>at the time of their punishment they shall perish.</t>
Jeremiah 10-16 <t>Not like these is he who is <f>ⓗ</f>the portion of Jacob, </t><t>for he is the one who formed all things, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>the LORD of hosts is his name. </t>
Jeremiah 10-17 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> Gather up your bundle from the ground, </t><t>O you who dwell under siege!</t>
Jeremiah 10-18 <t>For thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>“Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land </t><t>at this time, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and I will bring distress on them, </t><t>that they may feel it.” </t>

Jeremiah 10-21 <t><f>ⓡ</f> For the shepherds <f>ⓢ</f>are stupid </t><t>and do not inquire of the LORD; </t><t>therefore they have not prospered, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>and all their flock is scattered. </t>
Jeremiah 10-22 <pb/><t>A voice, a rumor! Behold, it comes! — </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>a great commotion out of the north country </t><t>to make <f>ⓥ</f>the cities of Judah a desolation, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>a lair of jackals. </t>
Jeremiah 10-23 <pb/><t><f>ⓧ</f> I know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself, </t><t>that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</t>
Jeremiah 10-24 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Correct me, O LORD, but in justice; </t><t>not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing. </t>
Jeremiah 10-25 <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f> Pour out your wrath on the nations that know you not, </t><t>and on the peoples that call not on your name, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>for they have devoured Jacob; </t><t>they have devoured him and consumed him, </t><t>and have laid waste his habitation. </t>
1 Timothy 2-1 <pb/>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,
1 Timothy 2-2 <f>ⓐ</f> for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and <f>ⓑ</f>dignified in every way.
1 Timothy 2-3 This is good, and <f>ⓒ</f>it is pleasing in the sight of <f>ⓓ</f>God our Savior,
1 Timothy 2-4 who desires <f>ⓔ</f>all people to be saved and <f>ⓕ</f>to come to <f>ⓖ</f>the knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy 2-5 For <f>ⓗ</f>there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man <f>[1]</f> Christ Jesus,
1 Timothy 2-6 <f>ⓘ</f> who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is <f>ⓙ</f>the testimony given <f>ⓚ</f>at the proper time.
1 Timothy 2-7 <f>ⓛ</f> For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (<f>ⓜ</f>I am telling the truth, I am not lying), <f>ⓝ</f>a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
1 Timothy 2-8 <pb/>I desire then that <f>ⓞ</f>in every place the men should pray, <f>ⓟ</f>lifting <f>ⓠ</f>holy hands without anger or quarreling;
1 Timothy 2-9 likewise also <f>ⓡ</f>that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire,
1 Timothy 2-10 <f>ⓢ</f> but with what is proper for women who profess godliness — with good works.
1 Timothy 2-11 Let a woman learn quietly <f>ⓣ</f>with all submissiveness.
1 Timothy 2-12 <f>ⓤ</f> I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.
1 Timothy 2-13 <f>ⓥ</f> For Adam was formed first, <f>ⓦ</f>then Eve;
1 Timothy 2-14 and Adam was not deceived, but <f>ⓧ</f>the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
1 Timothy 2-15 Yet she will be saved through <f>ⓨ</f>childbearing — if they continue in <f>ⓩ</f>faith and love and holiness, with self-control.
