23-1 <pb/>Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
23-2 And Sarah died at <f>ⓐ</f>Kiriath-arba (that is, <f>ⓑ</f>Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
23-3 And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites, <f>[1]</f>
23-4 <f>ⓒ</f> “I am a sojourner and foreigner among you; <f>ⓓ</f>give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
23-5 The Hittites answered Abraham,
23-6 “Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God <f>[2]</f> among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead.”
23-7 Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.
23-8 And he said to them, “If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,
23-9 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place.”
23-10 <pb/>Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who <f>ⓔ</f>went in at the gate of his city,
23-11 “No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”
23-12 Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
23-13 And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, “But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.”
23-14 Ephron answered Abraham,
23-15 “My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred <f>ⓕ</f>shekels <f>[3]</f> of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.”
23-16 Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham <f>ⓖ</f>weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.
23-17 <pb/>So <f>ⓗ</f>the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over
23-18 to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
23-19 After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
23-20 The field and the cave that is in it <f>ⓘ</f>were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites.
21-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place.
21-2 He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of <f>ⓑ</f>Israel. <f>[1]</f>
21-3 Their father gave them great gifts of silver, gold, and valuable possessions, together with <f>ⓒ</f>fortified cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.
21-4 When Jehoram had ascended the throne of his father and was established, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of <f>ⓓ</f>Israel.
21-5 <f>ⓔ</f> Jehoram was <f>ⓕ</f>thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
21-6 <f>ⓖ</f> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for <f>ⓗ</f>the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.
21-7 Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and since he had promised to give <f>ⓘ</f>a lamp to him and to his sons forever.
21-8 <pb/>In his days Edom revolted from the <f>ⓙ</f>rule of Judah and set up a king of their own.
21-9 Then Jehoram passed over with his commanders and all his chariots, and he rose by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders.
21-10 So Edom revolted from <f>ⓚ</f>the rule of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah also revolted from his rule, because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.
21-11 <pb/>Moreover, he made high places in the hill country of Judah and led the inhabitants of Jerusalem <f>ⓛ</f>into whoredom and made Judah go astray.
21-12 And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father, <f>ⓜ</f>‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or <f>ⓝ</f>in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
21-13 <f>ⓞ</f> but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have enticed Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem <f>ⓟ</f>into whoredom, <f>ⓠ</f>as the house of Ahab led Israel into whoredom, and also you <f>ⓡ</f>have killed your brothers, of your father's house, who were better than you,
21-14 behold, the LORD will bring a great plague on your people, your children, your wives, and all your possessions,
21-15 and you yourself will have a severe sickness <f>ⓢ</f>with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels come out because of the disease, day by day.’”
21-16 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> And the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the anger <f>[2]</f> of the Philistines and of <f>ⓤ</f>the Arabians who are near the Ethiopians.
21-17 And they came up against Judah and invaded it and carried away all the possessions they found that belonged to the king's house, and also his sons and his wives, so that no son was left to him except <f>ⓥ</f>Jehoahaz, his youngest son.
21-18 <pb/>And after all this the LORD struck him <f>ⓦ</f>in his bowels with an incurable disease.
21-19 In the course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no fire in his honor, <f>ⓧ</f>like the fires made for his fathers.
21-20 <f>ⓨ</f> He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed <f>ⓩ</f>with no one's regret. <f>ⓐ</f>They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
8-1 <pb/>“At that time, declares the LORD, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs.
8-2 And they shall be spread <f>ⓐ</f>before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have gone after, and which they have sought and worshiped. <f>ⓑ</f>And they shall not be gathered or buried. <f>ⓒ</f>They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground.
8-3 <f>ⓓ</f> Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family <f>ⓔ</f>in all the places where I have driven them, declares the LORD of hosts.
8-4 <pb/><t>“You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>When men fall, do they not rise again? </t><t>If one turns away, does he not return?</t>
8-5 <t>Why then has this people <f>ⓖ</f>turned away </t><t>in perpetual <f>ⓗ</f>backsliding? </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>They hold fast to deceit; </t><t>they refuse to return.</t>
8-6 <t><f>ⓙ</f> I have paid attention and listened, </t><t>but they have not spoken rightly; </t><t>no man relents of his evil, </t><t>saying, ‘What have I done?’ </t><t>Everyone turns to his own course, </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>like a horse plunging headlong into battle.</t>
8-7 <t>Even the stork in the heavens </t><t>knows her times, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>the turtledove, <f>ⓜ</f>swallow, and crane <f>[1]</f> </t><t>keep the time of their coming, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>but my people know not </t><t>the rules <f>[2]</f> of the LORD. </t>
8-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓞ</f> “How can you say, ‘We are wise, </t><t>and the law of the LORD is with us’? </t><t>But behold, the lying pen of the scribes </t><t>has made it into a lie.</t>
8-9 <t><f>ⓟ</f> The wise men shall be put to shame; </t><t>they shall be dismayed <f>ⓠ</f>and taken; </t><t>behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, </t><t>so what wisdom is in them?</t>
8-10 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Therefore I will give their wives to others </t><t>and their fields to conquerors, </t><t>because from the least to the greatest </t><t>everyone <f>ⓢ</f>is greedy for unjust gain; </t><t>from prophet to priest, </t><t>everyone deals falsely.</t>
8-11 <t>They have healed <f>ⓣ</f>the wound of my people lightly, </t><t>saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ </t><t>when there is no peace.</t>
8-12 <t>Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? </t><t>No, <f>ⓤ</f>they were not at all ashamed; </t><t>they did not know how to blush. </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>Therefore they shall fall among the fallen; </t><t>when I punish them, they shall be overthrown, <pb/>says the LORD.</t>
8-13 <t>When I would gather them, declares the LORD, </t><t>there are <f>ⓦ</f>no grapes on the vine, </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>nor figs on the fig tree; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>even the leaves are withered, </t><t>and what I gave them has passed away from them.” <f>[3]</f> </t>
8-14 <pb/><t>Why do we sit still? </t><t><f>ⓩ</f>Gather together; <f>ⓐ</f>let us go into the fortified cities </t><t>and perish there, </t><t>for the LORD our God has doomed us to perish </t><t>and has <f>ⓑ</f>given us <f>ⓒ</f>poisoned water to drink, </t><t>because we have sinned against the LORD.</t>
8-15 <t><f>ⓓ</f> We looked for peace, but no good came; </t><t>for a time of healing, but behold, terror. </t>
8-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “The snorting of their horses is heard <f>ⓕ</f>from Dan; </t><t>at the sound of the neighing <f>ⓖ</f>of their stallions </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>the whole land quakes. </t><t>They come <f>ⓘ</f>and devour the land and all that fills it, </t><t>the city and those who dwell in it.</t>
8-17 <t>For behold, I am sending among you <f>ⓙ</f>serpents, </t><t>adders <f>ⓚ</f>that cannot be charmed, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>and they shall bite you,” <pb/>declares the LORD. </t>
8-18 <pb/><t>My joy is gone; grief is upon me; <f>[4]</f> </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>my heart is sick within me.</t>
8-19 <t>Behold, the cry of the daughter of my people </t><t>from <f>ⓝ</f>the length and breadth of the land: </t><t>“Is the LORD not in Zion? </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Is her King not in her?” </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>“Why have they provoked me to anger with their carved images </t><t>and with their foreign idols?”</t>
8-20 <t>“The harvest is past, the summer is ended, </t><t>and we are not saved.”</t>
8-21 <t>For the wound of <f>ⓠ</f>the daughter of my people is my heart wounded; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>I mourn, and dismay has taken hold on me. </t>
8-22 <pb/><t>Is there no <f>ⓢ</f>balm in Gilead? </t><t>Is there no physician there? </t><t>Why then has the health of the daughter of my people </t><t>not been restored? </t>
3-1 <pb/>Finally, brothers, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f>pray for us, that <f>ⓑ</f>the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored, <f>[2]</f> as happened among you,
3-2 and <f>ⓒ</f>that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men. For <f>ⓓ</f>not all have faith.
3-3 But <f>ⓔ</f>the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and <f>ⓕ</f>guard you against <f>ⓖ</f>the evil one. <f>[3]</f>
3-4 And <f>ⓗ</f>we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things that we command.
3-5 May the Lord <f>ⓘ</f>direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.
3-6 <pb/>Now we command you, brothers, <f>ⓙ</f>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, <f>ⓚ</f>that you keep away from any <f>ⓛ</f>brother <f>ⓜ</f>who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us.
3-7 For you yourselves know <f>ⓝ</f>how you ought to imitate us, because <f>ⓞ</f>we were not idle when we were with you,
3-8 nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but <f>ⓟ</f>with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.
3-9 It was <f>ⓠ</f>not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves <f>ⓡ</f>an example to imitate.
3-10 For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: <f>ⓢ</f>If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
3-11 For we hear that some among you <f>ⓣ</f>walk in idleness, not busy at work, but <f>ⓤ</f>busybodies.
3-12 Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. <f>[4]</f>
3-13 <pb/>As for you, brothers, <f>ⓥ</f>do not grow weary in doing good.
3-14 If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and <f>ⓦ</f>have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed.
3-15 <f>ⓧ</f> Do not regard him as an enemy, but <f>ⓨ</f>warn him as a brother.
3-16 <pb/>Now may <f>ⓩ</f>the Lord of peace himself <f>ⓐ</f>give you peace at all times in every way. <f>ⓑ</f>The Lord be with you all.
3-17 <pb/>I, Paul, write <f>ⓒ</f>this greeting with my own hand. This is the sign of genuineness in every letter of mine; it is the way I write.
3-18 <f>ⓓ</f> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
