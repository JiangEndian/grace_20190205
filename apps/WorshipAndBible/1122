4-1 <pb/>When Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner had died at Hebron, <f>ⓐ</f>his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed.
4-2 Now Saul's son had two men who were captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Beeroth (<f>ⓑ</f>for Beeroth also is counted part of Benjamin;
4-3 <f>ⓒ</f> the Beerothites fled <f>ⓓ</f>to Gittaim and have been sojourners there to this day).
4-4 <pb/><f>ⓔ</f> Jonathan, the son of Saul, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan <f>ⓕ</f>came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and as she fled in her haste, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
4-5 <pb/>Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bosheth as he was taking his noonday rest.
4-6 And they came into the midst of the house as if to get wheat, and they stabbed him <f>ⓖ</f>in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. <f>[1]</f>
4-7 When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him and put him to death and beheaded him. They took his head and went by the way of <f>ⓗ</f>the Arabah all night,
4-8 and brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, <f>ⓘ</f>who sought your life. The LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.”
4-9 But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, <f>ⓙ</f>“As the LORD lives, <f>ⓚ</f>who has redeemed my life out of every adversity,
4-10 <f>ⓛ</f> when one told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was bringing good news, <f>ⓜ</f>I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.
4-11 How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed, shall I not now <f>ⓝ</f>require his blood at your hand and destroy you from the earth?”
4-12 And David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth and buried it <f>ⓞ</f>in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.
8-1 <pb/><t>Does not <f>ⓐ</f>wisdom call? </t><t>Does not <f>ⓑ</f>understanding raise her voice?</t>
8-2 <t>On <f>ⓒ</f>the heights beside the way, </t><t>at the crossroads she takes her stand;</t>
8-3 <t>beside <f>ⓓ</f>the gates in front of <f>ⓔ</f>the town, </t><t>at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:</t>

8-12 <pb/><t>“I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, </t><t>and I find knowledge and <f>ⓢ</f>discretion.</t>

8-22 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> “The LORD <f>ⓚ</f>possessed <f>[2]</f> me at the beginning of his work, <f>[3]</f> </t><t>the first of his acts <f>ⓛ</f>of old.</t>
8-23 <t>Ages ago I was <f>ⓜ</f>set up, </t><t>at the first, <f>ⓝ</f>before the beginning of the earth.</t>
8-24 <t>When there were no <f>ⓞ</f>depths I was <f>ⓟ</f>brought forth, </t><t>when there were no springs abounding with water.</t>
8-25 <t>Before the mountains <f>ⓠ</f>had been shaped, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>before the hills, I was brought forth,</t>
8-26 <t>before he had made the earth with its fields, </t><t>or the first of the dust of the world.</t>
8-27 <t>When he <f>ⓢ</f>established the heavens, I was there; </t><t>when he drew <f>ⓣ</f>a circle on the face of the deep,</t>
8-28 <t>when he <f>ⓤ</f>made firm the skies above, </t><t>when he established <f>[4]</f> the fountains of the deep,</t>
8-29 <t>when he <f>ⓥ</f>assigned to the sea its <f>ⓦ</f>limit, </t><t>so that the waters might not transgress his command, </t><t>when he marked out <f>ⓧ</f>the foundations of the earth,</t>
8-30 <t>then <f>ⓨ</f>I was beside him, like a master workman, </t><t>and I was daily his <f>[5]</f> <f>ⓩ</f>delight, </t><t>rejoicing before him always,</t>

4-1 <pb/>Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and <f>ⓐ</f>baptizing more disciples than John
4-2 (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),
4-3 he left Judea and departed <f>ⓑ</f>again for Galilee.
4-4 <f>ⓒ</f> And he had to pass through Samaria.
4-5 So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field <f>ⓓ</f>that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
4-6 Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, <f>ⓔ</f>wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour. <f>[1]</f>
4-7 <pb/>A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“Give me a drink.”</J>
4-8 (For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)
4-9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” (<f>ⓖ</f>For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
4-10 Jesus answered her, <J>“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you <f>ⓗ</f>living water.”</J>
4-11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?
4-12 <f>ⓘ</f> Are you greater than our father Jacob? <f>ⓙ</f>He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.”
4-13 Jesus said to her, <J>“Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,</J>
4-14 <J>but <f>ⓚ</f>whoever drinks of the water that I will give him <f>ⓛ</f>will never be thirsty again. <f>[2]</f> The water that I will give him will become <f>ⓜ</f>in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</J>
4-15 The woman said to him, “Sir, <f>ⓝ</f>give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”
4-16 <pb/>Jesus said to her, <J>“Go, <f>ⓞ</f>call your husband, and come here.”</J>
4-17 The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, <J>“You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’;</J>
4-18 <J>for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”</J>
4-19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that <f>ⓟ</f>you are <f>ⓠ</f>a prophet.
4-20 <f>ⓡ</f> Our fathers worshiped on <f>ⓢ</f>this mountain, but you say that <f>ⓣ</f>in Jerusalem is <f>ⓤ</f>the place where people ought to worship.”
4-21 Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“Woman, believe me, <f>ⓦ</f>the hour is coming when <f>ⓧ</f>neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</J>
4-22 <J><f>ⓨ</f> You worship what you do not know; <f>ⓩ</f>we worship what we know, for <f>ⓐ</f>salvation is <f>ⓑ</f>from the Jews.</J>
4-23 <J>But <f>ⓒ</f>the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father <f>ⓓ</f>in spirit and <f>ⓔ</f>truth, for the Father <f>ⓕ</f>is seeking such people to worship him.</J>
4-24 <J>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</J>
4-25 The woman said to him, “I know that <f>ⓖ</f>Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, <f>ⓗ</f>he will tell us all things.”
4-26 Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓘ</f>“I who speak to you am he.”</J>
4-27 <pb/>Just then <f>ⓙ</f>his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with her?”
4-28 So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people,
4-29 “Come, see a man <f>ⓚ</f>who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?”
4-30 They went out of the town and were coming to him.
4-31 <pb/>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, <f>ⓛ</f>“Rabbi, eat.”
4-32 But he said to them, <J>“I have food to eat that you do not know about.”</J>
4-33 So the disciples said to one another, <f>ⓜ</f>“Has anyone brought him something to eat?”
4-34 Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓝ</f>“My food is <f>ⓞ</f>to do the will of him who sent me and <f>ⓟ</f>to accomplish his work.</J>
4-35 <J>Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that <f>ⓠ</f>the fields are white for harvest.</J>
4-36 <J>Already</J> <J>the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that <f>ⓡ</f>sower and <f>ⓢ</f>reaper <f>ⓣ</f>may rejoice together.</J>
4-37 <J>For here the saying holds true, <f>ⓤ</f>‘One sows and another reaps.’</J>
4-38 <J>I sent you to reap <f>ⓥ</f>that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, <f>ⓦ</f>and you have entered into their labor.”</J>
4-39 <pb/>Many Samaritans <f>ⓧ</f>from that town believed in him <f>ⓨ</f>because of <f>ⓩ</f>the woman's testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.”
4-40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
4-41 And many more believed <f>ⓐ</f>because of his word.
4-42 They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, <f>ⓑ</f>and we know that this is indeed <f>ⓒ</f>the Savior <f>ⓓ</f>of the world.”
4-43 <pb/>After <f>ⓔ</f>the two days he departed for Galilee.
4-44 (For Jesus himself had testified <f>ⓕ</f>that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.)
4-45 So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, <f>ⓖ</f>having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For <f>ⓗ</f>they too had gone to the feast.
4-46 <pb/>So he came again to <f>ⓘ</f>Cana in Galilee, <f>ⓙ</f>where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill.
4-47 When this man heard that Jesus <f>ⓚ</f>had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
4-48 So Jesus said to him, <J> <f>ⓛ</f>“Unless you <f>[3]</f> see signs and wonders you will not believe.”</J>
4-49 The official said to him, “Sir, come down <f>ⓜ</f>before my child dies.”
4-50 Jesus said to him, <J>“Go; your son will live.”</J> The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way.
4-51 As he was going down, his servants <f>[4]</f> met him and told him that his son was recovering.
4-52 So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour <f>[5]</f> the fever left him.”
4-53 The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, <J>“Your son will live.”</J> And he himself believed, <f>ⓝ</f>and all his household.
4-54 <f>ⓞ</f> This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.
