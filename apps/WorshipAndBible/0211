14-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also masons and carpenters to build a house for him.
14-2 And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
14-3 <pb/>And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters.
14-4 <f>ⓑ</f> These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: <f>ⓒ</f>Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
14-5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
14-6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
14-7 Elishama, <f>ⓓ</f>Beeliada and <f>ⓔ</f>Eliphelet.
14-8 <pb/>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went out against them.
14-9 Now the Philistines had come and <f>ⓕ</f>made a raid in the <f>ⓖ</f>Valley of Rephaim.
14-10 And David inquired of God, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?” And the LORD said to him, “Go up, and I will give them into your hand.”
14-11 And he went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them down there. And David said, “God has broken through <f>[1]</f> my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood.” Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim.
14-12 And they left their gods there, and David gave command, and they were burned.
14-13 <pb/>And the Philistines yet again <f>ⓗ</f>made a raid in the valley.
14-14 And when David again inquired of God, <f>ⓘ</f>God said to him, “You shall not go up after them; go around and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
14-15 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”
14-16 And David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
14-17 And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the LORD brought the <f>ⓙ</f>fear of him upon all nations.
38-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In those days Hezekiah became <f>ⓑ</f>sick and was at the point of death. And <f>ⓒ</f>Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall not recover.” <f>[1]</f>
38-2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
38-3 and said, “Please, O LORD, remember how <f>ⓓ</f>I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
38-4 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah:
38-5 “Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add <f>ⓔ</f>fifteen years to your life. <f>[2]</f>
38-6 <f>ⓕ</f> I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and will defend this city.
38-7 <pb/>“This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has promised:
38-8 <f>ⓖ</f> Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps.” So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined. <f>[3]</f>
38-9 <pb/>A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
38-10 <pb/><t>I said, <f>ⓗ</f>In the middle <f>[4]</f> of my days </t><t>I must depart; </t><t>I am consigned to the gates of Sheol </t><t>for the rest of my years.</t>
38-11 <t>I said, I shall not see the LORD, </t><t>the LORD <f>ⓘ</f>in the land of the living; </t><t>I shall look on man no more </t><t>among the inhabitants of the world.</t>
38-12 <t>My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>like a shepherd's tent; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>like a weaver <f>ⓛ</f>I have rolled up my life; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>he cuts me off from the loom; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>from day to night you bring me to an end;</t>
38-13 <t><f>ⓞ</f> I calmed myself <f>[5]</f> until morning; </t><t>like a lion <f>ⓟ</f>he breaks all my bones; </t><t>from day to night you bring me to an end. </t>
38-14 <pb/><t>Like <f>ⓠ</f>a swallow or a crane I chirp; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>I moan like a dove. </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>My eyes are weary with looking upward. </t><t>O Lord, I am oppressed; <f>ⓣ</f>be my pledge of safety!</t>
38-15 <t>What shall I say? For he has spoken to me, </t><t>and he himself has done it. </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>I walk slowly all my years </t><t>because of the bitterness of my soul. </t>
38-16 <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f> O Lord, by these things men live, </t><t>and in all these is the life of my spirit. </t><t>Oh restore me to health and make me live!</t>
38-17 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Behold, it was for my welfare </t><t>that I had great bitterness; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>but in love you have delivered my life </t><t>from the pit of destruction, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>for you have cast all my sins </t><t>behind your back.</t>
38-18 <t><f>ⓩ</f> For Sheol does not thank you; </t><t>death does not praise you; </t><t>those who go down to the pit do not hope </t><t>for your faithfulness.</t>
38-19 <t>The living, the living, he thanks you, </t><t>as I do this day; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>the father makes known to the children </t><t>your faithfulness. </t>
38-20 <pb/><t>The LORD will save me, </t><t>and we will play my music on stringed instruments </t><t>all the days of our lives, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>at the house of the LORD. </t>
38-21 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover.”
38-22 Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?”
4-1 <pb/>Therefore, having <f>ⓐ</f>this ministry <f>ⓑ</f>by the mercy of God, <f>[1]</f> we do not lose heart.
4-2 But we have renounced <f>ⓒ</f>disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice <f>[2]</f> cunning or <f>ⓓ</f>to tamper with God's word, but <f>ⓔ</f>by the open statement of the truth <f>ⓕ</f>we would commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.
4-3 And even <f>ⓖ</f>if our gospel is veiled, <f>ⓗ</f>it is veiled to <f>ⓘ</f>those who are perishing.
4-4 In their case <f>ⓙ</f>the god of this world <f>ⓚ</f>has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing <f>ⓛ</f>the light of <f>ⓜ</f>the gospel of the glory of Christ, <f>ⓝ</f>who is the image of God.
4-5 For what <f>ⓞ</f>we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with <f>ⓟ</f>ourselves as your servants <f>[3]</f> for Jesus' sake.
4-6 For God, who said, <f>ⓠ</f>“Let light shine out of darkness,” <f>ⓡ</f>has shone in our hearts to give <f>ⓢ</f>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
4-7 <pb/>But we have this treasure in <f>ⓣ</f>jars of clay, <f>ⓤ</f>to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.
4-8 We are <f>ⓥ</f>afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
4-9 persecuted, but <f>ⓦ</f>not forsaken; <f>ⓧ</f>struck down, but not destroyed;
4-10 <f>ⓨ</f> always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, <f>ⓩ</f>so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.
4-11 For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
4-12 So <f>ⓐ</f>death is at work in us, but life in you.
4-13 <pb/>Since we have <f>ⓑ</f>the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, <f>ⓒ</f>“I believed, and so I spoke,” we also believe, and so we also speak,
4-14 knowing that <f>ⓓ</f>he who raised the Lord Jesus <f>ⓔ</f>will raise us also with Jesus and <f>ⓕ</f>bring us with you into his presence.
4-15 For <f>ⓖ</f>it is all for your sake, so that as <f>ⓗ</f>grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, <f>ⓘ</f>to the glory of God.
4-16 <pb/>So we do not lose heart. <f>ⓙ</f>Though our outer self <f>[4]</f> is wasting away, <f>ⓚ</f>our inner self <f>ⓛ</f>is being renewed day by day.
4-17 For <f>ⓜ</f>this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,
4-18 <f>ⓝ</f> as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
