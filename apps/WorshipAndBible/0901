2-1 <pb/>And Joshua the son of Nun <f>ⓐ</f>sent <f>[1]</f> two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” And they went and came into the house of <f>ⓑ</f>a prostitute whose name was <f>ⓒ</f>Rahab and lodged there.
2-2 And it was told to the king of Jericho, “Behold, men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.”
2-3 Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.”
2-4 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. And she said, “True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.
2-5 And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.”
2-6 But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof.
2-7 So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan <f>ⓓ</f>as far as the fords. And the gate was shut as soon as the pursuers had gone out.
2-8 <pb/>Before the men <f>[2]</f> lay down, she came up to them on the roof
2-9 and said to the men, “I know that the LORD has given you the land, <f>ⓔ</f>and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land <f>ⓕ</f>melt away before you.
2-10 For we have heard how the LORD <f>ⓖ</f>dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and <f>ⓗ</f>what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to <f>ⓘ</f>Sihon and Og, whom you devoted to destruction. <f>[3]</f>
2-11 And <f>ⓙ</f>as soon as we heard it, <f>ⓚ</f>our hearts melted, and there was no spirit left in any man because of you, for <f>ⓛ</f>the LORD your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.
2-12 Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that, as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father's house, and <f>ⓜ</f>give me a sure sign
2-13 that you will save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”
2-14 And the men said to her, “Our life for yours even to death! If you do not tell this business of ours, then when the LORD gives us the land <f>ⓝ</f>we will deal kindly and faithfully with you.”
2-15 <pb/>Then she <f>ⓞ</f>let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she lived in the wall.
2-16 And she said <f>[4]</f> to them, “Go into the hills, or the pursuers will encounter you, and hide there three days until the pursuers have returned. Then afterward you may go your way.”
2-17 The men said to her, “We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours that you have made us swear.
2-18 <f>ⓟ</f> Behold, when we come into the land, you shall tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, <f>ⓠ</f>and you shall gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.
2-19 Then if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, <f>ⓡ</f>his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be guiltless. But if a hand is laid on anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head.
2-20 But if you <f>ⓢ</f>tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath that you have made us swear.”
2-21 And she said, “According to your words, so be it.” Then she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
2-22 <pb/>They departed and went into the hills and remained there three days until the pursuers returned, and the pursuers searched all along the way and found nothing.
2-23 Then the two men returned. They came down from the hills and <f>ⓣ</f>passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they told him all that had happened to them.
2-24 And they said to Joshua, “Truly <f>ⓤ</f>the LORD has given all the land into our hands. And also, all the inhabitants of the land <f>ⓥ</f>melt away because of us.”
76-1 <f>ⓐ</f> <f>ⓑ</f> <pb/><t>In Judah God is <f>ⓒ</f>known; </t><t>his name is great in Israel.</t>
76-2 <t>His <f>ⓓ</f>abode has been established in <f>ⓔ</f>Salem, </t><t>his <f>ⓕ</f>dwelling place in Zion.</t>
76-3 <t>There he <f>ⓖ</f>broke the flashing arrows, </t><t>the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
76-4 <pb/><t>Glorious are you, more majestic </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>than the mountains full of <f>ⓘ</f>prey.</t>
76-5 <t><f>ⓙ</f> The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>they sank into sleep; </t><t>all the men of war </t><t>were unable to use their hands.</t>
76-6 <t>At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, </t><t>both <f>ⓛ</f>rider and horse lay stunned. </t>
76-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> But you, you are to be feared! </t><t>Who can <f>ⓝ</f>stand before you </t><t>when once your anger is roused?</t>
76-8 <t>From the heavens you uttered judgment; </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>the earth feared and was still,</t>
76-9 <t>when God <f>ⓟ</f>arose to establish judgment, </t><t>to save all the humble of the earth. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
76-10 <pb/><t>Surely <f>ⓠ</f>the wrath of man shall praise you; </t><t>the remnant <f>[1]</f> of wrath you will put on like a belt.</t>
76-11 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Make your vows to the LORD your God and perform them; </t><t>let all around him <f>ⓢ</f>bring gifts </t><t>to him who <f>ⓣ</f>is to be feared,</t>
76-12 <t>who <f>ⓤ</f>cuts off the spirit of princes, </t><t>who <f>ⓥ</f>is to be feared by the kings of the earth. </t>
8-1 <pb/>And the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,
8-2 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓐ</f>I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
8-3 Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓑ</f>I have returned to Zion and <f>ⓒ</f>will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, <f>ⓓ</f>and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, <f>ⓔ</f>and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain.
8-4 Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓕ</f>Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age.
8-5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
8-6 Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓖ</f>If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, <f>ⓗ</f>should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the LORD of hosts?
8-7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, <f>ⓘ</f>I will save my people <f>ⓙ</f>from the east country and from the west country,
8-8 and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. <f>ⓚ</f>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, <f>ⓛ</f>in faithfulness and in righteousness.”
8-9 <pb/>Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓜ</f>“Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of <f>ⓝ</f>the prophets who were present on <f>ⓞ</f>the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
8-10 For before those days <f>ⓟ</f>there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor.
8-11 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the LORD of hosts.
8-12 <f>ⓠ</f> For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, <f>ⓡ</f>and the heavens shall give their dew. <f>ⓢ</f>And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
8-13 And as <f>ⓣ</f>you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, <f>ⓤ</f>so will I save you, and <f>ⓥ</f>you shall be a blessing. <f>ⓦ</f>Fear not, but <f>ⓧ</f>let your hands be strong.”
8-14 <pb/>For thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓨ</f>“As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the LORD of hosts,
8-15 so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; <f>ⓩ</f>fear not.
8-16 These are the things that you shall do: <f>ⓐ</f>Speak the truth to one another; <f>ⓑ</f>render in your gates judgments <f>ⓒ</f>that are true and make for peace;
8-17 <f>ⓓ</f> do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and <f>ⓔ</f>love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the LORD.”
8-18 <pb/>And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
8-19 “Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the <f>ⓕ</f>fourth month and the fast of the <f>ⓖ</f>fifth and the fast of the <f>ⓗ</f>seventh and the fast of the <f>ⓘ</f>tenth shall be to the house of Judah <f>ⓙ</f>seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love <f>ⓚ</f>truth and peace.
8-20 <pb/>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities.
8-21 The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, <f>ⓛ</f>‘Let us go at once <f>ⓜ</f>to entreat the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts; I myself am going.’
8-22 <f>ⓝ</f> Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and <f>ⓞ</f>to entreat the favor of the LORD.
8-23 Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days <f>ⓟ</f>ten men <f>ⓠ</f>from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, ‘Let us go with you, for <f>ⓡ</f>we have heard that God is with you.’”
