5-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> Now <f>ⓐ</f>Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, <f>ⓑ</f>for Hiram always loved David.
5-2 And Solomon sent word to Hiram,
5-3 <f>ⓒ</f> “You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God <f>ⓓ</f>because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
5-4 <f>ⓔ</f> But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune.
5-5 And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, <f>ⓕ</f>as the LORD said to David my father, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.’
5-6 Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”
5-7 <pb/>As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.”
5-8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.
5-9 My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes <f>ⓖ</f>by providing food for my household.”
5-10 So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired,
5-11 while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors <f>[2]</f> of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 <f>[3]</f> cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.
5-12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, <f>ⓗ</f>as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.
5-13 <pb/>King Solomon drafted <f>ⓘ</f>forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men.
5-14 And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. <f>ⓙ</f>Adoniram was in charge of the draft.
5-15 Solomon also <f>ⓚ</f>had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country,
5-16 besides Solomon's 3,300 <f>ⓛ</f>chief officers who were over the work, <f>ⓜ</f>who had charge of the people who carried on the work.
5-17 At the king's command <f>ⓝ</f>they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones.
5-18 So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and <f>ⓞ</f>the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house.
2-1 <pb/>I <f>ⓐ</f>said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But behold, this also was vanity. <f>[1]</f>
2-2 I <f>ⓑ</f>said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of pleasure, “What use is it?”
2-3 I <f>ⓒ</f>searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine — my heart still guiding me with wisdom — and how to lay hold on <f>ⓓ</f>folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.
2-4 I made great works. I <f>ⓔ</f>built houses and planted <f>ⓕ</f>vineyards for myself.
2-5 I made myself <f>ⓖ</f>gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
2-6 I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.
2-7 I bought male and female slaves, and had <f>ⓗ</f>slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of <f>ⓘ</f>herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.
2-8 I also gathered for myself silver and <f>ⓙ</f>gold and the treasure of <f>ⓚ</f>kings and <f>ⓛ</f>provinces. I got <f>ⓜ</f>singers, both men and women, and many <f>ⓝ</f>concubines, <f>[2]</f> the delight of the sons of man.
2-9 <pb/>So I became great and <f>ⓞ</f>surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my <f>ⓟ</f>wisdom remained with me.
2-10 And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart <f>ⓠ</f>found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my <f>ⓡ</f>reward for all my toil.
2-11 Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was <f>ⓢ</f>vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing <f>ⓣ</f>to be gained under the sun.
2-12 <pb/><f>ⓤ</f> So I turned to consider <f>ⓥ</f>wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only <f>ⓦ</f>what has already been done.
2-13 Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.
2-14 <f>ⓧ</f> The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the <f>ⓨ</f>same event happens to all of them.
2-15 Then I said in my heart, <f>ⓩ</f>“What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?” And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
2-16 For of the wise as of the fool there is <f>ⓐ</f>no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. <f>ⓑ</f>How the wise dies just like the fool!
2-17 So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for <f>ⓒ</f>all is vanity and a striving after wind.
2-18 <pb/>I hated <f>ⓓ</f>all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must <f>ⓔ</f>leave it to the man who will come after me,
2-19 and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.
2-20 So I <f>ⓕ</f>turned about and gave my heart up to despair <f>ⓖ</f>over all the toil of my labors under the sun,
2-21 because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
2-22 What has a man from <f>ⓗ</f>all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?
2-23 For <f>ⓘ</f>all his days are full of sorrow, and his <f>ⓙ</f>work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.
2-24 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> There is nothing better for a person than that he should <f>ⓛ</f>eat and drink and find enjoyment <f>[3]</f> in his toil. This also, I saw, is <f>ⓜ</f>from the hand of God,
2-25 for apart from him <f>[4]</f> who can eat or who can have enjoyment?
2-26 For to the one who pleases him <f>ⓝ</f>God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given <f>ⓞ</f>the business of gathering and collecting, <f>ⓟ</f>only to give to one who pleases God. <f>ⓠ</f>This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
8-1 <pb/>And <f>ⓐ</f>Saul <f>ⓑ</f>approved of his execution. <pb/>And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and <f>ⓒ</f>they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
8-2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
8-3 But <f>ⓓ</f>Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he <f>ⓔ</f>dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.
8-4 <pb/>Now <f>ⓕ</f>those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
8-5 <f>ⓖ</f> Philip went down to the city <f>[1]</f> of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.
8-6 <f>ⓗ</f> And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip, when they heard him <f>ⓘ</f>and saw the signs that he did.
8-7 For <f>ⓙ</f>unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
8-8 So <f>ⓚ</f>there was much joy in that city.
8-9 <pb/>But there was a man named Simon, <f>ⓛ</f>who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, <f>ⓜ</f>saying that he himself was somebody great.
8-10 They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, <f>ⓝ</f>“This man is the power of God that is called <f>ⓞ</f>Great.”
8-11 And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had <f>ⓟ</f>amazed them with his magic.
8-12 But when <f>ⓠ</f>they believed Philip as he preached good news <f>ⓡ</f>about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, <f>ⓢ</f>they were baptized, both men and women.
8-13 Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And <f>ⓣ</f>seeing signs and <f>ⓤ</f>great miracles <f>[2]</f> performed, <f>ⓥ</f>he was amazed.
8-14 <pb/>Now when <f>ⓦ</f>the apostles at Jerusalem heard that <f>ⓧ</f>Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,
8-15 who came down and prayed for them <f>ⓨ</f>that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
8-16 for <f>ⓩ</f>he had not yet <f>ⓐ</f>fallen on any of them, but <f>ⓑ</f>they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
8-17 Then <f>ⓒ</f>they laid their hands on them and <f>ⓓ</f>they received the Holy Spirit.
8-18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
8-19 saying, “Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”
8-20 But Peter said to him, <f>ⓔ</f>“May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God <f>ⓕ</f>with money!
8-21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for <f>ⓖ</f>your heart is not right before God.
8-22 Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, <f>ⓗ</f>if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
8-23 For I see that you are in <f>ⓘ</f>the gall <f>[3]</f> of bitterness and in <f>ⓙ</f>the bond of iniquity.”
8-24 And Simon answered, <f>ⓚ</f>“Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”
8-25 <pb/>Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, <f>ⓛ</f>preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
8-26 <pb/>Now <f>ⓜ</f>an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Rise and go toward the south <f>[4]</f> to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is a desert place.
8-27 And he rose and went. And there was an <f>ⓝ</f>Ethiopian, a <f>ⓞ</f>eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, <f>ⓟ</f>who was in charge of all her treasure. <f>ⓠ</f>He had come to Jerusalem to worship
8-28 and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
8-29 And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.”
8-30 So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”
8-31 And he said, <f>ⓡ</f>“How can I, unless someone <f>ⓢ</f>guides me?” And <f>ⓣ</f>he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
8-32 Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter </t><t>and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, </t><t>so he opens not his mouth.</t>
8-33 <t>In his <f>ⓥ</f>humiliation justice was denied him. </t><t>Who can describe his generation? </t><t>For his life is taken away from the earth.” </t>
8-34 <pb/>And the eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?”
8-35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and <f>ⓦ</f>beginning with this Scripture <f>ⓧ</f>he told him the good news about Jesus.
8-36 And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! <f>ⓨ</f>What prevents me from being baptized?” <f>[5]</f>
8-37 
8-38 And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
8-39 And when they came up out of the water, <f>ⓩ</f>the Spirit of the Lord <f>ⓐ</f>carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.
8-40 But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
