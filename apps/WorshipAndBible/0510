25-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses,
25-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Speak to the people of Israel, that they take for me a contribution. From <f>ⓑ</f>every man whose heart moves him you shall receive the contribution for me.
25-3 And this is the contribution that you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze,
25-4 <f>ⓒ</f> blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen, goats' hair,
25-5 tanned <f>ⓓ</f>rams' skins, goatskins, <f>[1]</f> acacia wood,
25-6 <f>ⓔ</f> oil for the lamps, <f>ⓕ</f>spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense,
25-7 onyx stones, and stones for setting, for the <f>ⓖ</f>ephod and for the breastpiece.
25-8 And let them make me a <f>ⓗ</f>sanctuary, that <f>ⓘ</f>I may dwell in their midst.
25-9 <f>ⓙ</f> Exactly as I show you concerning the pattern of the <f>ⓚ</f>tabernacle, and of all its furniture, so you shall make it.
25-10 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “They shall make an ark of acacia wood. Two cubits <f>[2]</f> and a half shall be its length, a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
25-11 You shall overlay it with <f>ⓜ</f>pure gold, inside and outside shall you overlay it, and you shall make on it a molding of gold around it.
25-12 You shall cast four rings of gold for it and put them on its <f>ⓝ</f>four feet, two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
25-13 You shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
25-14 And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark by them.
25-15 The <f>ⓞ</f>poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it.
25-16 <f>ⓟ</f> And you shall put into the ark the <f>ⓠ</f>testimony that I shall give you.
25-17 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> “You shall make a mercy seat <f>[3]</f> of pure gold. Two cubits and a half shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth.
25-18 And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of <f>ⓢ</f>hammered work shall you make them, on the two ends of the mercy seat.
25-19 Make one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end. <f>ⓣ</f>Of one piece with the mercy seat shall you make the cherubim on its two ends.
25-20 <f>ⓤ</f> The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.
25-21 And you shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you.
25-22 <f>ⓥ</f> There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from <f>ⓦ</f>between the two cherubim that are on the ark of the testimony, I will speak with you about all that I will give you in commandment for the people of Israel.
25-23 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> “You shall make a table of acacia wood. Two cubits shall be its length, a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
25-24 You shall overlay it with <f>ⓨ</f>pure gold and make a molding of gold around it.
25-25 And you shall make a rim around it a handbreadth <f>[4]</f> wide, and a molding of gold around the rim.
25-26 And you shall make for it four rings of gold, and fasten the rings to the four corners at its four legs.
25-27 Close to the frame the rings shall lie, as <f>ⓩ</f>holders for the poles to carry the table.
25-28 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, and the table shall be carried with these.
25-29 And you shall make its plates and <f>ⓐ</f>dishes for incense, and its flagons and bowls with which to pour drink offerings; you shall make them of pure gold.
25-30 And you shall set the <f>ⓑ</f>bread of the Presence on the table before me regularly.
25-31 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> “You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand shall be made of hammered work: its base, its stem, its cups, its calyxes, and its flowers shall be of one piece with it.
25-32 And there shall be six branches going out of its sides, three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side of it;
25-33 three cups made like almond blossoms, each with calyx and flower, on one branch, and three cups made like almond blossoms, each with calyx and flower, on the other branch — so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.
25-34 And on the lampstand itself there shall be four cups made like almond blossoms, with their calyxes and flowers,
25-35 and a calyx of one piece with it under each pair of the six branches going out from the lampstand.
25-36 Their calyxes and their branches shall be of one piece with it, the whole of it a single piece of hammered work of pure gold.
25-37 You shall make seven lamps for it. And the lamps <f>ⓓ</f>shall be set up so as <f>ⓔ</f>to give light on the space in front of it.
25-38 Its tongs and their trays shall be of pure gold.
25-39 It shall be made, with all these utensils, out of a talent <f>[5]</f> of pure gold.
25-40 And <f>ⓕ</f>see that you make them after the pattern for them, which is being shown you on the mountain.
4-1 <pb/>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
4-2 <pb/><t>“If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? </t><t>Yet who can keep from speaking?</t>
4-3 <t>Behold, you have instructed many, </t><t>and you have <f>ⓐ</f>strengthened the weak hands.</t>
4-4 <t>Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, </t><t>and you have <f>ⓑ</f>made firm the feeble knees.</t>
4-5 <t>But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; </t><t>it touches you, and you are dismayed.</t>
4-6 <t><f>ⓒ</f> Is not your fear of God <f>[1]</f> your <f>ⓓ</f>confidence, </t><t>and the integrity of your ways your hope? </t>
4-7 <pb/><t>“Remember: <f>ⓔ</f>who that was innocent ever perished? </t><t>Or where were the upright cut off?</t>
4-8 <t>As I have seen, those who <f>ⓕ</f>plow iniquity </t><t>and sow trouble reap the same.</t>
4-9 <t>By <f>ⓖ</f>the breath of God they perish, </t><t>and by <f>ⓗ</f>the blast of his anger they are consumed.</t>
4-10 <t>The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>the teeth of the young lions are broken.</t>
4-11 <t>The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, </t><t>and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. </t>
4-12 <pb/><t>“Now a word was brought to me stealthily; </t><t>my ear received <f>ⓙ</f>the whisper of it.</t>
4-13 <t>Amid <f>ⓚ</f>thoughts from <f>ⓛ</f>visions of the night, </t><t>when <f>ⓜ</f>deep sleep falls on men,</t>
4-14 <t>dread came upon me, and trembling, </t><t>which made all my bones shake.</t>
4-15 <t>A spirit glided past my face; </t><t>the hair of my flesh stood up.</t>
4-16 <t>It stood still, </t><t>but I could not discern its appearance. </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>A form was before my eyes; </t><t>there was silence, then I heard <f>ⓞ</f>a voice:</t>
4-17 <t><f>ⓟ</f> ‘Can mortal man be in the right before <f>[2]</f> God? </t><t>Can a man be pure before his Maker?</t>
4-18 <t>Even in his servants <f>ⓠ</f>he puts no trust, </t><t>and his angels he charges with error;</t>
4-19 <t>how much more those who dwell in houses of <f>ⓡ</f>clay, </t><t>whose foundation is in <f>ⓢ</f>the dust, </t><t>who are crushed like <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓣ</f>the moth.</t>
4-20 <t>Between <f>ⓤ</f>morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; </t><t>they perish forever <f>ⓥ</f>without anyone regarding it.</t>
4-21 <t>Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>do they not die, and that without wisdom?’ </t>
3-1 <pb/>And he said to me, <f>ⓐ</f>“Son of man, eat whatever you find here. <f>ⓑ</f>Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
3-2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat.
3-3 And he said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it.” <f>ⓒ</f>Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth <f>ⓓ</f>as sweet as honey.
3-4 <pb/>And he said to me, <f>ⓔ</f>“Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them.
3-5 For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel —
3-6 not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. <f>ⓕ</f>Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you.
3-7 <f>ⓖ</f> But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel <f>ⓗ</f>have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.
3-8 <f>ⓘ</f> Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
3-9 Like <f>ⓙ</f>emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. <f>ⓚ</f>Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.”
3-10 Moreover, he said to me, “Son of man, <f>ⓛ</f>all my words that I shall speak to you receive <f>ⓜ</f>in your heart, and hear with your ears.
3-11 And go to the exiles, <f>ⓝ</f>to your people, and speak to them and say to them, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ <f>ⓟ</f>whether they hear or refuse to hear.”
3-12 <pb/><f>ⓠ</f> Then the Spirit <f>[1]</f> lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice <f>[2]</f> of <f>ⓡ</f>a great earthquake: “Blessed be the glory of the LORD from its place!”
3-13 It was the sound of the wings of <f>ⓢ</f>the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of <f>ⓣ</f>a great earthquake.
3-14 <f>ⓤ</f> The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the <f>ⓥ</f>hand of the LORD being strong upon me.
3-15 <f>ⓦ</f> And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling <f>ⓧ</f>by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling. <f>[3]</f> And <f>ⓨ</f>I sat there <f>ⓩ</f>overwhelmed among them <f>ⓐ</f>seven days.
3-16 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> And at the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me:
3-17 <f>ⓒ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓓ</f>I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall <f>ⓔ</f>give them warning from me.
3-18 <f>ⓕ</f> If I say to the wicked, <f>ⓖ</f>‘You shall surely die,’ <f>ⓗ</f>and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person <f>ⓘ</f>shall die for <f>[4]</f> his iniquity, <f>ⓙ</f>but his blood I will require at your hand.
3-19 <f>ⓚ</f> But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, <f>ⓛ</f>but you <f>ⓜ</f>will have delivered your soul.
3-20 <f>ⓝ</f> Again, if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, <f>ⓞ</f>and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. <f>ⓟ</f>Because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, <f>ⓠ</f>and his righteous deeds that he has done shall not be remembered, <f>ⓡ</f>but his blood I will require at your hand.
3-21 But if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul.”
3-22 <pb/><f>ⓢ</f> And the hand of the LORD was upon me there. And he said to me, “Arise, go out into <f>ⓣ</f>the valley, <f>[5]</f> and <f>ⓤ</f>there I will speak with you.”
3-23 So I arose and went out into the valley, and behold, <f>ⓥ</f>the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory that I had seen <f>ⓦ</f>by the Chebar canal, <f>ⓧ</f>and I fell on my face.
3-24 <f>ⓨ</f> But the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself within your house.
3-25 And you, O son of man, behold, <f>ⓩ</f>cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people.
3-26 And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that <f>ⓐ</f>you shall be mute and unable to reprove them, <f>ⓑ</f>for they are a rebellious house.
3-27 <f>ⓒ</f> But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, <f>ⓓ</f>‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’ <f>ⓔ</f>He who will hear, let him hear; and he who will refuse to hear, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.
4-1 <pb/>After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me <f>ⓐ</f>like a trumpet, said, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“Come up here, and <f>ⓒ</f>I will show you what must take place after this.”</J>
4-2 At once <f>ⓓ</f>I was in the Spirit, and behold, <f>ⓔ</f>a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne.
4-3 And he who sat there had the appearance of <f>ⓕ</f>jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was <f>ⓖ</f>a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.
4-4 Around the throne were <f>ⓗ</f>twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, <f>ⓘ</f>clothed in white garments, with <f>ⓙ</f>golden crowns on their heads.
4-5 From the throne came <f>ⓚ</f>flashes of lightning, and rumblings <f>[1]</f> and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning <f>ⓛ</f>seven torches of fire, <f>ⓜ</f>which are the seven spirits of God,
4-6 and before the throne there was <f>ⓝ</f>as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. <pb/>And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are <f>ⓞ</f>four living creatures, <f>ⓟ</f>full of eyes in front and behind:
4-7 <f>ⓠ</f> the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight.
4-8 And the four living creatures, <f>ⓡ</f>each of them with six wings, are <f>ⓢ</f>full of eyes all around and within, and <f>ⓣ</f>day and night they never cease to say, <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f>“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>who was and is and is to come!” </t>
4-9 <pb/>And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, <f>ⓦ</f>who lives forever and ever,
4-10 the twenty-four elders <f>ⓧ</f>fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast <f>ⓨ</f>their crowns before the throne, saying,
4-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓩ</f> “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, </t><t>to receive glory and honor and power, </t><t>for <f>ⓐ</f>you created all things, </t><t>and <f>ⓑ</f>by your will they existed and were created.” </t>
