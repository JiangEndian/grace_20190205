Genesis 6-1 <pb/>When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them,
Genesis 6-2 the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.
Genesis 6-3 Then the LORD said, <f>ⓐ</f>“My Spirit shall not abide in <f>[1]</f> man forever, <f>ⓑ</f>for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.”
Genesis 6-4 The Nephilim <f>[2]</f> were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.
Genesis 6-5 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every <f>ⓓ</f>intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
Genesis 6-6 And <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it <f>ⓕ</f>grieved him to his heart.
Genesis 6-7 So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.”
Genesis 6-8 But Noah <f>ⓖ</f>found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
Genesis 6-9 <pb/>These are the generations of Noah. <f>ⓗ</f>Noah was a righteous man, <f>ⓘ</f>blameless in his generation. Noah <f>ⓙ</f>walked with God.
Genesis 6-10 And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis 6-11 <pb/>Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
Genesis 6-12 And God <f>ⓚ</f>saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, <f>ⓛ</f>for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
Genesis 6-13 And God said to Noah, <f>ⓜ</f>“I have determined to make an end of all flesh, <f>[3]</f> for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
Genesis 6-14 Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. <f>[4]</f> Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
Genesis 6-15 This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, <f>[5]</f> its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
Genesis 6-16 Make a roof <f>[6]</f> for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks.
Genesis 6-17 <f>ⓝ</f> For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.
Genesis 6-18 But <f>ⓞ</f>I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
Genesis 6-19 And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female.
Genesis 6-20 Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive.
Genesis 6-21 Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up. It shall serve as food for you and for them.”
Genesis 6-22 <f>ⓟ</f> Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
2 Chronicles 4-1 <pb/>He made <f>ⓐ</f>an altar of bronze, twenty cubits <f>[1]</f> long and twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.
2 Chronicles 4-2 <f>ⓑ</f> Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.
2 Chronicles 4-3 Under it were figures of gourds, <f>[2]</f> for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.
2 Chronicles 4-4 It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.
2 Chronicles 4-5 Its thickness was a handbreadth. <f>[3]</f> And its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. <f>ⓒ</f>It held 3,000 baths. <f>[4]</f>
2 Chronicles 4-6 <f>ⓓ</f> He also made ten basins in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.
2 Chronicles 4-7 <pb/>And he made ten golden lampstands <f>ⓔ</f>as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
2 Chronicles 4-8 <f>ⓕ</f> He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
2 Chronicles 4-9 He made <f>ⓖ</f>the court of the priests <f>ⓗ</f>and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid their doors with bronze.
2 Chronicles 4-10 <f>ⓘ</f> And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
2 Chronicles 4-11 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> <f>ⓚ</f>Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. <f>ⓛ</f>So Hiram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God:
2 Chronicles 4-12 the two pillars, <f>ⓜ</f>the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
2 Chronicles 4-13 <f>ⓝ</f> and the 400 pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.
2 Chronicles 4-14 <f>ⓞ</f> He made the stands also, and the basins on the stands,
2 Chronicles 4-15 and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it.
2 Chronicles 4-16 The pots, the shovels, <f>ⓟ</f>the forks, and all the equipment for these <f>ⓠ</f> <f>ⓡ</f>Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 4-17 In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. <f>[5]</f>
2 Chronicles 4-18 <f>ⓢ</f> Solomon made all these things in great quantities, for the weight of the bronze was not sought.
2 Chronicles 4-19 <pb/>So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God: the golden altar, <f>ⓣ</f>the tables for the bread of the Presence,
2 Chronicles 4-20 the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold <f>ⓤ</f>to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed;
2 Chronicles 4-21 the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold;
2 Chronicles 4-22 the snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold, and the sockets <f>[6]</f> of the temple, for the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and for the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.
Isaiah 57-1 <pb/><t>The righteous man perishes, </t><t>and no one lays it to heart; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>devout men are taken away, </t><t>while no one understands. </t><t>For the righteous man is taken away from calamity;</t>
Isaiah 57-2 <t><f>ⓑ</f> he enters into peace; </t><t>they rest <f>ⓒ</f>in their beds </t><t>who walk in their uprightness.</t>
Isaiah 57-3 <t>But you, draw near, </t><t>sons of the sorceress, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>offspring of the adulterer and the loose woman.</t>
Isaiah 57-4 <t>Whom are you mocking? </t><t>Against whom <f>ⓔ</f>do you open your mouth wide </t><t>and stick out your tongue? </t><t>Are you not children of <f>ⓕ</f>transgression, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>the offspring of deceit,</t>
Isaiah 57-5 <t>you who burn with lust among <f>ⓗ</f>the oaks, <f>[1]</f> </t><t>under every green tree, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>who slaughter your children in the valleys, </t><t>under the clefts of the rocks?</t>
Isaiah 57-6 <t>Among the smooth stones of <f>ⓙ</f>the valley is your portion; </t><t>they, they, are your lot; </t><t>to them you have poured out a drink offering, </t><t>you have brought a grain offering. </t><t>Shall I relent for these things?</t>
Isaiah 57-7 <t><f>ⓚ</f> On a high and lofty mountain </t><t>you have set your bed, </t><t>and there you went up to offer sacrifice.</t>
Isaiah 57-8 <t>Behind the door and the doorpost </t><t>you have set up your memorial; </t><t>for, deserting me, <f>ⓛ</f>you have uncovered your bed, </t><t>you have gone up to it, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>you have made it wide; </t><t>and you have made a covenant for yourself with them, </t><t>you have loved their bed, </t><t>you have looked on nakedness. <f>[2]</f></t>
Isaiah 57-9 <t>You journeyed to the king with oil </t><t>and multiplied your perfumes; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>you sent your envoys far off, </t><t>and sent down even to Sheol.</t>
Isaiah 57-10 <t>You were wearied with the length of your way, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>but you did not say, “It is hopeless”; </t><t>you found new life for your strength, </t><t>and so you were not faint. <f>[3]</f> </t>
Isaiah 57-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓟ</f> Whom did you dread and fear, </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>so that you lied, </t><t>and did not remember me, </t><t>did not lay it to heart? </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>Have I not held my peace, even for a long time, </t><t>and you do not fear me?</t>
Isaiah 57-12 <t>I will declare your righteousness and your deeds, </t><t>but they will not profit you.</t>
Isaiah 57-13 <t><f>ⓢ</f> When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you! </t><t>The wind will carry them all off, </t><t>a breath will take them away. </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>But he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land </t><t>and shall inherit <f>ⓤ</f>my holy mountain. </t>
Isaiah 57-14 <pb/><t>And it shall be said, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>“Build up, build up, prepare the way, </t><t>remove every obstruction from my people's way.”</t>
Isaiah 57-15 <t>For thus says <f>ⓦ</f>the One who is high and lifted up, </t><t>who inhabits eternity, whose name is <f>ⓧ</f>Holy: </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>“I dwell in the high and holy place, </t><t>and also <f>ⓩ</f>with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit, </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>to revive the spirit of the lowly, </t><t>and to revive the heart of the contrite.</t>
Isaiah 57-16 <t><f>ⓑ</f> For I will not contend forever, </t><t>nor will I always be angry; </t><t>for the spirit would grow faint before me, </t><t>and the breath of life that I made.</t>
Isaiah 57-17 <t>Because of the iniquity of his <f>ⓒ</f>unjust gain I was angry, </t><t>I struck him; I hid my face and was angry, </t><t>but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart.</t>
Isaiah 57-18 <t>I have seen his ways, <f>ⓓ</f>but I will heal him; </t><t>I will lead him <f>ⓔ</f>and restore comfort to him and his mourners,</t>
Isaiah 57-19 <t><f>ⓕ</f> creating <f>ⓖ</f>the fruit of the lips. </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>Peace, peace, <f>ⓘ</f>to the far and to the near,” says the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>“and I will heal him.</t>
Isaiah 57-20 <t><f>ⓚ</f> But the wicked are like the tossing sea; </t><t>for it cannot be quiet, </t><t>and its waters toss up mire and dirt.</t>
Isaiah 57-21 <t><f>ⓛ</f> There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.” </t>
Ephesians 5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.
Ephesians 5-2 And <f>ⓑ</f>walk in love, <f>ⓒ</f>as Christ loved us and <f>ⓓ</f>gave himself up for us, a <f>ⓔ</f>fragrant <f>ⓕ</f>offering and sacrifice to God.
Ephesians 5-3 <pb/>But <f>ⓖ</f>sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness <f>ⓗ</f>must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.
Ephesians 5-4 Let there be <f>ⓘ</f>no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, <f>ⓙ</f>which are out of place, but instead <f>ⓚ</f>let there be thanksgiving.
Ephesians 5-5 For you may be sure of this, that <f>ⓛ</f>everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (<f>ⓜ</f>that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
Ephesians 5-6 <f>ⓝ</f> Let no one <f>ⓞ</f>deceive you with empty words, for because of these things <f>ⓟ</f>the wrath of God comes upon <f>ⓠ</f>the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians 5-7 Therefore <f>ⓡ</f>do not become partners with them;
Ephesians 5-8 for <f>ⓢ</f>at one time you were <f>ⓣ</f>darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. <f>ⓤ</f>Walk as children of light
Ephesians 5-9 (for <f>ⓥ</f>the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true),
Ephesians 5-10 and <f>ⓦ</f>try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
Ephesians 5-11 <f>ⓧ</f> Take no part in the <f>ⓨ</f>unfruitful <f>ⓩ</f>works of darkness, but instead <f>ⓐ</f>expose them.
Ephesians 5-12 For <f>ⓑ</f>it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret.
Ephesians 5-13 But when <f>ⓒ</f>anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible,
Ephesians 5-14 for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f>“Awake, O sleeper, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>arise from the dead, </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>Christ will shine on you.” </t>
Ephesians 5-15 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,
Ephesians 5-16 <f>ⓗ</f> making the best use of the time, because <f>ⓘ</f>the days are evil.
Ephesians 5-17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what <f>ⓙ</f>the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians 5-18 And <f>ⓚ</f>do not get drunk with wine, for that is <f>ⓛ</f>debauchery, but <f>ⓜ</f>be filled with the Spirit,
Ephesians 5-19 addressing one another in <f>ⓝ</f>psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart,
Ephesians 5-20 <f>ⓞ</f> giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father <f>ⓟ</f>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Ephesians 5-21 <f>ⓠ</f> submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
Ephesians 5-22 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> Wives, <f>ⓢ</f>submit to your own husbands, <f>ⓣ</f>as to the Lord.
Ephesians 5-23 For <f>ⓤ</f>the husband is the head of the wife even as <f>ⓥ</f>Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is <f>ⓦ</f>himself its Savior.
Ephesians 5-24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit <f>ⓧ</f>in everything to their husbands.
Ephesians 5-25 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and <f>ⓩ</f>gave himself up for her,
Ephesians 5-26 that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by <f>ⓐ</f>the washing of water <f>ⓑ</f>with the word,
Ephesians 5-27 so <f>ⓒ</f>that he might present the church to himself in splendor, <f>ⓓ</f>without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. <f>[1]</f>
Ephesians 5-28 In the same way <f>ⓔ</f>husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
Ephesians 5-29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,
Ephesians 5-30 because <f>ⓕ</f>we are members of his body.
Ephesians 5-31 <f>ⓖ</f> “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and <f>ⓗ</f>the two shall become one flesh.”
Ephesians 5-32 This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.
Ephesians 5-33 However, <f>ⓘ</f>let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she <f>ⓙ</f>respects her husband.
