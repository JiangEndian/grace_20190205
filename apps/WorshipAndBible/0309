Genesis 13-1 <pb/>So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, <f>ⓐ</f>into the Negeb.
Genesis 13-2 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis 13-3 And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
Genesis 13-4 to <f>ⓒ</f>the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD.
Genesis 13-5 And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,
Genesis 13-6 so that <f>ⓓ</f>the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together,
Genesis 13-7 <f>ⓔ</f> and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. At that time <f>ⓕ</f>the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.
Genesis 13-8 <pb/>Then Abram said to Lot, <f>ⓖ</f>“Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, <f>ⓗ</f>for we are kinsmen. <f>[1]</f>
Genesis 13-9 <f>ⓘ</f> Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”
Genesis 13-10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the <f>ⓙ</f>Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like <f>ⓚ</f>the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of <f>ⓛ</f>Zoar. (This was before the LORD <f>ⓜ</f>destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
Genesis 13-11 So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other.
Genesis 13-12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
Genesis 13-13 Now the men of Sodom <f>ⓝ</f>were wicked, great sinners against the LORD.
Genesis 13-14 <pb/>The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, <f>ⓞ</f>northward and southward and eastward and westward,
Genesis 13-15 for all the land that you see I will give <f>ⓟ</f>to you and <f>ⓠ</f>to your offspring forever.
Genesis 13-16 <f>ⓡ</f> I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.
Genesis 13-17 Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.”
Genesis 13-18 So Abram moved his tent and came and <f>ⓢ</f>settled by the <f>ⓣ</f>oaks <f>[2]</f> of Mamre, which <f>ⓤ</f>are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.
2 Chronicles 11-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
2 Chronicles 11-2 But the word of the LORD came to <f>ⓑ</f>Shemaiah the man of God:
2 Chronicles 11-3 “Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
2 Chronicles 11-4 ‘Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against <f>ⓒ</f>your relatives. Return every man to his home, for this thing is from me.’” So they listened to the word of the LORD and returned and did not go against Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles 11-5 <pb/>Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built <f>ⓓ</f>cities for defense in Judah.
2 Chronicles 11-6 He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
2 Chronicles 11-7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
2 Chronicles 11-8 Gath, <f>ⓔ</f>Mareshah, Ziph,
2 Chronicles 11-9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
2 Chronicles 11-10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin.
2 Chronicles 11-11 He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.
2 Chronicles 11-12 And he put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles 11-13 <pb/>And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all places where they lived.
2 Chronicles 11-14 For the Levites left <f>ⓕ</f>their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem, <f>ⓖ</f>because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the LORD,
2 Chronicles 11-15 and he appointed his own <f>ⓗ</f>priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for <f>ⓘ</f>the calves that he had made.
2 Chronicles 11-16 <f>ⓙ</f> And those who had set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 11-17 <f>ⓚ</f> They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.
2 Chronicles 11-18 <pb/>Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of <f>ⓛ</f>Eliab the son of Jesse,
2 Chronicles 11-19 and she bore him sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
2 Chronicles 11-20 After her he took <f>ⓜ</f>Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore him <f>ⓝ</f>Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
2 Chronicles 11-21 Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters).
2 Chronicles 11-22 <f>ⓞ</f> And Rehoboam appointed <f>ⓟ</f>Abijah the son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king.
2 Chronicles 11-23 And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities, and he gave them abundant provisions and procured wives for them. <f>[1]</f>
Isaiah 64-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>that the mountains might quake at your presence — </t>
Isaiah 64-2 <t><f>[1]</f> as when fire kindles brushwood </t><t>and the fire causes water to boil — </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>to make your name known to your adversaries, </t><t>and that the nations might tremble at your presence!</t>
Isaiah 64-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> When you did awesome things that we did not look for, </t><t>you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.</t>
Isaiah 64-4 <t><f>ⓔ</f> From of old no one has heard </t><t>or perceived by the ear, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>no eye has seen a God besides you, </t><t>who acts for those who wait for him.</t>
Isaiah 64-5 <t>You meet him who joyfully works righteousness, </t><t>those who remember you in your ways. </t><t>Behold, you were angry, and we sinned; </t><t>in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved? <f>[2]</f></t>
Isaiah 64-6 <t><f>ⓖ</f> We have all become like one who is unclean, </t><t>and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>We all fade like a leaf, </t><t>and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</t>
Isaiah 64-7 <t><f>ⓘ</f> There is no one who calls upon your name, </t><t>who rouses himself to take hold of you; </t><t>for you have hidden your face from us, </t><t>and have made us melt in <f>[3]</f> the hand of our iniquities. </t>
Isaiah 64-8 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> But now, O LORD, you are our Father; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>we are the clay, and you are our potter; </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>we are all the work of your hand.</t>

Colossians 2-1 <pb/>For I want you to know <f>ⓐ</f>how great a <f>ⓑ</f>struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face,
Colossians 2-2 that <f>ⓒ</f>their hearts may be encouraged, being <f>ⓓ</f>knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of <f>ⓔ</f>God's mystery, which is Christ,
Colossians 2-3 <f>ⓕ</f> in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians 2-4 I say this in order <f>ⓖ</f>that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.
Colossians 2-5 For <f>ⓗ</f>though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your <f>ⓘ</f>good order and <f>ⓙ</f>the firmness of your faith in Christ.
Colossians 2-6 <pb/><f>ⓚ</f> Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,
Colossians 2-7 <f>ⓛ</f> rooted and <f>ⓜ</f>built up in him and <f>ⓝ</f>established in the faith, just <f>ⓞ</f>as you were taught, abounding <f>ⓟ</f>in thanksgiving.
Colossians 2-8 <pb/>See to it that no one takes you captive by <f>ⓠ</f>philosophy and <f>ⓡ</f>empty deceit, according to <f>ⓢ</f>human tradition, according to the <f>ⓣ</f>elemental spirits <f>[1]</f> of the world, and not according to Christ.
Colossians 2-9 For <f>ⓤ</f>in him the whole fullness of deity dwells <f>ⓥ</f>bodily,
Colossians 2-10 and <f>ⓦ</f>you have been filled in him, who is <f>ⓧ</f>the head of all rule and authority.
Colossians 2-11 In him also <f>ⓨ</f>you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by <f>ⓩ</f>putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
Colossians 2-12 <f>ⓐ</f> having been buried with him in baptism, in which <f>ⓑ</f>you were also raised with him through faith in <f>ⓒ</f>the powerful working of God, <f>ⓓ</f>who raised him from the dead.
Colossians 2-13 <f>ⓔ</f> And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God <f>ⓕ</f>made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,
Colossians 2-14 by <f>ⓖ</f>canceling <f>ⓗ</f>the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.
Colossians 2-15 <f>ⓘ</f> He disarmed the rulers and authorities <f>[2]</f> and <f>ⓙ</f>put them to open shame, by <f>ⓚ</f>triumphing over them in him. <f>[3]</f>
Colossians 2-16 <pb/>Therefore let no one <f>ⓛ</f>pass judgment on you <f>ⓜ</f>in questions of food and drink, or with regard to <f>ⓝ</f>a festival or <f>ⓞ</f>a new moon or a Sabbath.
Colossians 2-17 <f>ⓟ</f> These are a shadow of the things to come, but <f>ⓠ</f>the substance belongs to Christ.
Colossians 2-18 Let no one <f>ⓡ</f>disqualify you, <f>ⓢ</f>insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, <f>ⓣ</f>going on in detail about visions, <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>puffed up without reason by <f>ⓥ</f>his sensuous mind,
Colossians 2-19 and <f>ⓦ</f>not <f>ⓧ</f>holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.
Colossians 2-20 <pb/>If with Christ <f>ⓨ</f>you died to the <f>ⓩ</f>elemental spirits of the world, <f>ⓐ</f>why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations —
Colossians 2-21 <f>ⓑ</f> “Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch”
Colossians 2-22 (<f>ⓒ</f>referring to things that all perish as they are used) — according to <f>ⓓ</f>human precepts and teachings?
Colossians 2-23 These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in <f>ⓔ</f>promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are <f>ⓕ</f>of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
