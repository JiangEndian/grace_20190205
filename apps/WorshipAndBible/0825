29-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> These are the words of the covenant that the LORD commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel <f>ⓐ</f>in the land of Moab, besides <f>ⓑ</f>the covenant that he had made with them at Horeb.
29-2 <pb/><f>[2]</f> And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: <f>ⓒ</f>“You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land,
29-3 the great <f>ⓓ</f>trials that your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders.
29-4 But to this day <f>ⓔ</f>the LORD has not given you a heart to understand or eyes to see or ears to hear.
29-5 <f>ⓕ</f> I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn off your feet.
29-6 <f>ⓖ</f> You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.
29-7 And when you came to this place, <f>ⓗ</f>Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us to battle, but we defeated them.
29-8 We took their land and <f>ⓘ</f>gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites.
29-9 <f>ⓙ</f> Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them, that you may prosper <f>[3]</f> in all that you do.
29-10 <pb/>“You are standing today, all of you, before the LORD your God: the heads of your tribes, <f>[4]</f> your elders, and your officers, all the men of Israel,
29-11 your little ones, your wives, and the <f>ⓚ</f>sojourner who is in your camp, from <f>ⓛ</f>the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water,
29-12 so that you may enter into the <f>ⓜ</f>sworn covenant of the LORD your God, which the LORD your God is making with you today,
29-13 that he may <f>ⓝ</f>establish you today as his people, and that <f>ⓞ</f>he may be your God, as he promised you, and <f>ⓟ</f>as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
29-14 It is not with you alone <f>ⓠ</f>that I am making this sworn covenant,
29-15 but with whoever is standing here with us today before the LORD our God, <f>ⓡ</f>and with whoever is not here with us today.
29-16 <pb/>“You know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed.
29-17 And you have seen their detestable things, their idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold, which were among them.
29-18 Beware lest there be among you a man or woman or clan or tribe whose heart is turning away today from the LORD our God to go and serve the gods of those nations. Beware lest there be among you <f>ⓢ</f>a root bearing poisonous and bitter fruit,
29-19 one who, when he hears the words of this sworn covenant, blesses himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall be safe, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart.’ This will lead to the sweeping away of moist and dry alike.
29-20 The LORD will not be willing to forgive him, but rather <f>ⓣ</f>the anger of the LORD and <f>ⓤ</f>his jealousy will smoke against that man, and the curses written in this book will settle upon him, and the LORD <f>ⓥ</f>will blot out his name from under heaven.
29-21 And the LORD will single him out from all the tribes of Israel for calamity, in accordance with all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.
29-22 And the next generation, your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far land, <f>ⓦ</f>will say, when they see the afflictions of that land and the sicknesses with which the LORD has made it sick —
29-23 the whole land burned out with brimstone and <f>ⓧ</f>salt, nothing sown and nothing growing, where no plant can sprout, <f>ⓨ</f>an overthrow like that of Sodom and Gomorrah, <f>ⓩ</f>Admah, and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger and wrath —
29-24 all the nations <f>ⓐ</f>will say, <f>ⓑ</f>‘Why has the LORD done thus to this land? What caused the heat of this great anger?’
29-25 Then people will say, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt,
29-26 and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them.
29-27 Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, <f>ⓒ</f>bringing upon it all the curses written in this book,
29-28 and the LORD <f>ⓓ</f>uprooted them from their land in anger and fury and great wrath, and <f>ⓔ</f>cast them into another land, as they are this day.’
29-29 <pb/>“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.
69-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Save me, O God! </t><t>For <f>ⓑ</f>the waters have come up to my neck. <f>[1]</f></t>
69-2 <t>I sink in deep <f>ⓒ</f>mire, </t><t>where there is no foothold; </t><t>I have come into deep waters, </t><t>and the flood <f>ⓓ</f>sweeps over me.</t>
69-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> I am weary with my crying out; </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>my throat is parched. </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>My eyes grow dim </t><t>with <f>ⓗ</f>waiting for my God. </t>
69-4 <pb/><t><f>ⓘ</f> More in number than the hairs of my head </t><t>are <f>ⓙ</f>those who hate me <f>ⓚ</f>without cause; </t><t>mighty are those who would destroy me, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>those who attack me with lies. </t><t>What I did not steal </t><t>must I now restore?</t>
69-5 <t>O God, you know my folly; </t><t>the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you. </t>
69-6 <pb/><t>Let not those who hope in you <f>ⓜ</f>be put to shame through me, </t><t>O Lord GOD of hosts; </t><t>let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, </t><t>O God of Israel.</t>
69-7 <t>For it is <f>ⓝ</f>for your sake that I have borne reproach, </t><t>that dishonor has covered my face.</t>
69-8 <t>I have become <f>ⓞ</f>a stranger to my brothers, </t><t>an alien to my mother's sons. </t>
69-9 <pb/><t>For <f>ⓟ</f>zeal for your house has consumed me, </t><t>and <f>ⓠ</f>the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.</t>
69-10 <t>When I wept and humbled <f>[2]</f> my soul with fasting, </t><t>it became my reproach.</t>
69-11 <t>When I made <f>ⓡ</f>sackcloth my clothing, </t><t>I became <f>ⓢ</f>a byword to them.</t>
69-12 <t>I am the talk of those who <f>ⓣ</f>sit in the gate, </t><t>and the drunkards make <f>ⓤ</f>songs about me. </t>
69-13 <pb/><t>But as for me, my <f>ⓥ</f>prayer is to you, O LORD. </t><t>At <f>ⓦ</f>an acceptable time, O God, </t><t>in the abundance of your steadfast love answer me in your saving faithfulness.</t>
69-14 <t>Deliver me </t><t>from sinking in <f>ⓧ</f>the mire; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>let me be delivered from my enemies </t><t>and from <f>ⓩ</f>the deep waters.</t>
69-15 <t>Let not the flood sweep over me, </t><t>or the deep swallow me up, </t><t>or <f>ⓐ</f>the pit close <f>ⓑ</f>its mouth over me. </t>
69-16 <pb/><t>Answer me, O LORD, for your <f>ⓒ</f>steadfast love is good; </t><t>according to your abundant <f>ⓓ</f>mercy, <f>ⓔ</f>turn to me.</t>
69-17 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Hide not your face from your servant, </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>for I am in distress; <f>ⓗ</f>make haste to answer me.</t>
69-18 <t>Draw near to my soul, redeem me; </t><t>ransom me because of my enemies! </t>
69-19 <pb/><t>You know my <f>ⓘ</f>reproach, </t><t>and my shame and my dishonor; </t><t>my foes are all known to you.</t>
69-20 <t><f>ⓙ</f> Reproaches have broken my heart, </t><t>so that I am in <f>ⓚ</f>despair. </t><t>I <f>ⓛ</f>looked for <f>ⓜ</f>pity, but there was none, </t><t>and for <f>ⓝ</f>comforters, but I found none.</t>
69-21 <t>They gave me <f>ⓞ</f>poison for food, </t><t>and for my thirst they gave me <f>ⓟ</f>sour wine to drink. </t>
69-22 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> Let their own <f>ⓡ</f>table before them become a snare; </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>and when they are at peace, let it become a trap. <f>[3]</f></t>
69-23 <t><f>ⓣ</f> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>and make their loins tremble continually.</t>
69-24 <t>Pour out your indignation upon them, </t><t>and let your burning anger overtake them.</t>
69-25 <t><f>ⓥ</f> May their camp be a desolation; </t><t>let no one dwell in their tents.</t>
69-26 <t>For they <f>ⓦ</f>persecute him whom <f>ⓧ</f>you have struck down, </t><t>and they recount the pain of <f>ⓨ</f>those you have wounded.</t>
69-27 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Add to them punishment upon punishment; </t><t>may they have no acquittal from you. <f>[4]</f></t>
69-28 <t>Let them be <f>ⓐ</f>blotted out of the book of the living; </t><t>let them not be <f>ⓑ</f>enrolled among the righteous. </t>
69-29 <pb/><t>But I am afflicted and in pain; </t><t>let your salvation, O God, <f>ⓒ</f>set me on high! </t>
69-30 <pb/><t>I will <f>ⓓ</f>praise the name of God with a song; </t><t>I will <f>ⓔ</f>magnify him with <f>ⓕ</f>thanksgiving.</t>
69-31 <t>This will <f>ⓖ</f>please the LORD more than an ox </t><t>or a bull <f>ⓗ</f>with horns and hoofs.</t>
69-32 <t>When <f>ⓘ</f>the humble see it they will be glad; </t><t>you who seek God, <f>ⓙ</f>let your hearts revive.</t>
69-33 <t>For the LORD hears the needy </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>does not despise his own people who are prisoners. </t>
69-34 <pb/><t>Let <f>ⓛ</f>heaven and earth praise him, </t><t>the seas and everything that moves in them.</t>
69-35 <t>For <f>ⓜ</f>God will save Zion </t><t>and build up the cities of Judah, </t><t>and people shall dwell there and possess it;</t>
69-36 <t><f>ⓝ</f> the offspring of his servants shall inherit it, </t><t>and those who love his name shall dwell in it. </t>
1-1 <pb/>In the eighth month, <f>ⓐ</f>in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet <f>ⓑ</f>Zechariah, the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Berechiah, son of <f>ⓓ</f>Iddo, saying,
1-2 <f>ⓔ</f> “The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
1-3 Therefore say to them, Thus declares the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓕ</f>Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and <f>ⓖ</f>I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts.
1-4 <f>ⓗ</f> Do not be like your fathers, <f>ⓘ</f>to whom the former prophets cried out, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, <f>ⓙ</f>Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.’ But <f>ⓚ</f>they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the LORD.
1-5 Your fathers, where are they? And <f>ⓛ</f>the prophets, do they live forever?
1-6 <f>ⓜ</f> But my words and my statutes, which I commanded <f>ⓝ</f>my servants the prophets, did they not <f>ⓞ</f>overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, <f>ⓟ</f>‘As the LORD of hosts purposed to deal with us for <f>ⓠ</f>our ways and <f>ⓡ</f>deeds, so has he dealt with us.’”
1-7 <pb/>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet <f>ⓢ</f>Zechariah, the son of <f>ⓣ</f>Berechiah, son of <f>ⓤ</f>Iddo, saying,
1-8 “I saw in the night, and behold, <f>ⓥ</f>a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were <f>ⓦ</f>red, sorrel, and white horses.
1-9 Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ <f>ⓧ</f>The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’
1-10 So <f>ⓨ</f>the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, <f>ⓩ</f>‘These are they whom the LORD has sent to <f>ⓐ</f>patrol the earth.’
1-11 And they answered <f>ⓑ</f>the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, <f>ⓒ</f>‘We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth <f>ⓓ</f>remains at rest.’
1-12 Then <f>ⓔ</f>the angel of the LORD said, <f>ⓕ</f>‘O LORD of hosts, <f>ⓖ</f>how long will you <f>ⓗ</f>have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these <f>ⓘ</f>seventy years?’
1-13 And the LORD answered <f>ⓙ</f>gracious and comforting words to <f>ⓚ</f>the angel who talked with me.
1-14 So <f>ⓛ</f>the angel who talked with me said to me, ‘Cry out, Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓜ</f>I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.
1-15 <f>ⓝ</f> And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are <f>ⓞ</f>at ease; <f>ⓟ</f>for while I was angry but a little, <f>ⓠ</f>they furthered the disaster.
1-16 Therefore, thus says the LORD, <f>ⓡ</f>I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; <f>ⓢ</f>my house shall be built in it, declares the LORD of hosts, and <f>ⓣ</f>the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
1-17 Cry out again, Thus says the LORD of hosts: <f>ⓤ</f>My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, <f>ⓥ</f>and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again <f>ⓦ</f>choose Jerusalem.’”
1-18 <pb/><f>[1]</f> And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, <f>ⓧ</f>four horns!
1-19 And I said to <f>ⓨ</f>the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” And he said to me, <f>ⓩ</f>“These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
1-20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
1-21 And I said, “What are these coming to do?” He said, <f>ⓐ</f>“These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one raised his head. And these have come <f>ⓑ</f>to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations <f>ⓒ</f>who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”
