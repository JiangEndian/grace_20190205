25-1 <pb/>David and the chiefs of the service also set apart for the service the sons of <f>ⓐ</f>Asaph, and of <f>ⓑ</f>Heman, and of <f>ⓒ</f>Jeduthun, who <f>ⓓ</f>prophesied with lyres, with <f>ⓔ</f>harps, and with cymbals. The list of those who did the work and of their duties was:
25-2 Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah, sons of Asaph, under the direction of Asaph, who <f>ⓕ</f>prophesied under the direction of the king.
25-3 Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, <f>[1]</f> Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, <f>ⓖ</f>who prophesied with the lyre in thanksgiving and praise to the LORD.
25-4 Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.
25-5 All these were the sons of Heman <f>ⓗ</f>the king's seer, according to the promise of God to exalt him, for God had given Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
25-6 They were all under the direction of their father in the music in the house of the LORD with cymbals, <f>ⓘ</f>harps, and lyres for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the order of the king.
25-7 The number of them along with their brothers, who were trained in singing to the LORD, all who were skillful, was <f>ⓙ</f>288.
25-8 And they cast lots for their duties, <f>ⓚ</f>small and great, teacher and pupil alike.

25-27 to the twentieth, to Eliathah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
25-28 to the twenty-first, to Hothir, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
25-29 to the twenty-second, to Giddalti, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
25-30 to the twenty-third, to Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
25-31 to the twenty-fourth, to Romamti-ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve.
49-1 <pb/><t>Listen to me, <f>ⓐ</f>O coastlands, </t><t>and give attention, you peoples <f>ⓑ</f>from afar. </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>The LORD called me from the womb, </t><t>from the body of my mother he named my name.</t>
49-2 <t><f>ⓓ</f> He made my mouth like a sharp sword; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>in the shadow of his hand he hid me; </t><t>he made me a polished arrow; </t><t>in his quiver he hid me away.</t>
49-3 <t>And he said to me, “You are my servant, </t><t>Israel, <f>ⓕ</f>in whom I will be glorified.” <f>[1]</f></t>
49-4 <t><f>ⓖ</f> But I said, “I have labored in vain; </t><t>I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; </t><t>yet surely my right is with the LORD, </t><t>and my recompense with my God.” </t>
49-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓗ</f> And now the LORD says, </t><t>he <f>ⓘ</f>who formed me from the womb to be his servant, </t><t>to bring Jacob back to him; </t><t>and that Israel might be gathered to him — </t><t>for <f>ⓙ</f>I am honored in the eyes of the LORD, </t><t>and my God has become my strength — </t>
49-6 <t>he says: </t><t>“It is too light a thing that you should be my servant </t><t>to raise up the tribes of Jacob </t><t>and to bring back the preserved of Israel; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>I will make you <f>ⓛ</f>as a light for the nations, </t><t>that <f>ⓜ</f>my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.” </t>
49-7 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nation, </t><t>the servant of rulers: </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>“Kings shall see and arise; </t><t>princes, and they shall prostrate themselves; </t><t>because of the LORD, who is faithful, </t><t>the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.” </t>
49-8 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>“In a <f>ⓡ</f>time of favor I have answered you; </t><t>in a day of salvation I have helped you; </t><t>I will keep you <f>ⓢ</f>and give you </t><t>as a covenant to the people, </t><t>to establish the land, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>to apportion the desolate heritages,</t>
49-9 <t><f>ⓤ</f> saying to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’ </t><t>to those who are in darkness, ‘Appear.’ </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>They shall feed along the ways; </t><t>on all bare heights shall be their pasture;</t>
49-10 <t><f>ⓦ</f> they shall not hunger or thirst, </t><t>neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them, </t><t>for he who has pity on them <f>ⓧ</f>will lead them, </t><t>and by springs of water will guide them.</t>
49-11 <t><f>ⓨ</f> And I will make all my mountains a road, </t><t>and my highways shall be raised up.</t>
49-12 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Behold, these shall come from afar, </t><t>and behold, <f>ⓐ</f>these from the north and from the west, <f>[2]</f> </t><t>and these from the land of Syene.” <f>[3]</f> </t>
49-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth; </t><t>break forth, O mountains, into singing! </t><t>For the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>has comforted his people </t><t>and will have compassion on his afflicted. </t>
49-14 <pb/><t>But Zion said, <f>ⓓ</f>“The LORD has forsaken me; </t><t>my Lord has forgotten me.” </t>
49-15 <pb/><t><f>ⓔ</f> “Can a woman forget her nursing child, </t><t>that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? </t><t>Even these may forget, </t><t>yet I will not forget you.</t>
49-16 <t>Behold, <f>ⓕ</f>I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; </t><t>your walls are continually before me.</t>
49-17 <t>Your builders make haste; <f>[4]</f> </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>your destroyers and those who laid you waste go out from you.</t>
49-18 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Lift up your eyes around and see; </t><t>they all gather, they come to you. </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>As I live, declares the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>you shall put them all on as an ornament; </t><t>you shall bind them on as a bride does. </t>
49-19 <pb/><t>“Surely your waste and your desolate places </t><t>and your devastated land — </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>surely now you will be too narrow for your inhabitants, </t><t>and those who swallowed you up will be far away.</t>
49-20 <t><f>ⓛ</f> The children of your bereavement </t><t>will yet say in your ears: </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>‘The place is too narrow for me; </t><t>make room for me to dwell in.’</t>
49-21 <t>Then you will say in your heart: </t><t>‘Who has borne me these? </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>I was bereaved and barren, </t><t>exiled and put away, </t><t>but who has brought up these? </t><t>Behold, I was left alone; </t><t>from where have these come?’” </t>
49-22 <pb/><t>Thus says the Lord GOD: </t><t>“Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and raise my signal to the peoples; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>and they shall bring your sons in their arms, <f>[5]</f> </t><t>and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.</t>
49-23 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Kings shall be your foster fathers, </t><t>and their queens your nursing mothers. </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>With their faces to the ground they shall bow down to you, </t><t>and <f>ⓢ</f>lick the dust of your feet. </t><t>Then you will know that I am the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>those who wait for me <f>ⓤ</f>shall not be put to shame.” </t>
49-24 <pb/><t>Can the prey be taken from the mighty, </t><t>or the captives of a tyrant <f>[6]</f> be rescued?</t>
49-25 <t>For thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>“Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken, </t><t>and the prey of the tyrant be rescued, </t><t>for I will contend with those who contend with you, </t><t>and I will save your children.</t>
49-26 <t><f>ⓦ</f> I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh, </t><t>and they shall be drunk <f>ⓧ</f>with their own blood as with wine. </t><t>Then all flesh shall know </t><t>that <f>ⓨ</f>I am the LORD your Savior, </t><t>and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.” </t>
2-1 <pb/>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.
2-2 I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those <f>ⓐ</f>who seemed influential) the gospel that <f>ⓑ</f>I proclaim among the Gentiles, <f>ⓒ</f>in order to make sure I was not running or had not <f>ⓓ</f>run in vain.
2-3 But even Titus, who was with me, <f>ⓔ</f>was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.
2-4 <f>ⓕ</f> Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in — who <f>ⓖ</f>slipped in to spy out <f>ⓗ</f>our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, <f>ⓘ</f>so that they might bring us into slavery —
2-5 to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that <f>ⓙ</f>the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.
2-6 And from those <f>ⓚ</f>who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; <f>ⓛ</f>God shows no partiality) — those, I say, who seemed influential <f>ⓜ</f>added nothing to me.
2-7 On the contrary, when they saw that I had been <f>ⓝ</f>entrusted with <f>ⓞ</f>the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised
2-8 (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles),
2-9 and when James and Cephas and John, <f>ⓟ</f>who seemed to be <f>ⓠ</f>pillars, perceived the <f>ⓡ</f>grace that was given to me, they <f>ⓢ</f>gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
2-10 Only, they asked us to remember the poor, <f>ⓣ</f>the very thing I was eager to do.
2-11 <pb/>But <f>ⓤ</f>when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him <f>ⓥ</f>to his face, because he stood condemned.
2-12 For before certain men came from James, <f>ⓦ</f>he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing <f>ⓧ</f>the circumcision party. <f>[1]</f>
2-13 And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
2-14 But when I saw that their <f>ⓨ</f>conduct was not in step with <f>ⓩ</f>the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas <f>ⓐ</f>before them all, “If you, though a Jew, <f>ⓑ</f>live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”
2-15 <pb/>We ourselves are Jews by birth and not <f>ⓒ</f>Gentile sinners;
2-16 yet we know that <f>ⓓ</f>a person is not justified <f>[2]</f> by works of the law <f>ⓔ</f>but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, <f>ⓕ</f>because by works of the law no one will be justified.
2-17 <pb/>But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found <f>ⓖ</f>to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!
2-18 For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
2-19 For through the law I <f>ⓗ</f>died to the law, so that I might <f>ⓘ</f>live to God.
2-20 I have been <f>ⓙ</f>crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives <f>ⓚ</f>in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, <f>ⓛ</f>who loved me and <f>ⓜ</f>gave himself for me.
2-21 I do not nullify the grace of God, for <f>ⓝ</f>if righteousness <f>[3]</f> were through the law, <f>ⓞ</f>then Christ died for no purpose.
