28-1 <pb/>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
28-2 “Command the people of Israel and say to them, ‘My offering, <f>ⓐ</f>my food for my food offerings, my <f>ⓑ</f>pleasing aroma, you shall be careful to offer to me at its appointed time.’
28-3 <f>ⓒ</f> And you shall say to them, This is the food offering that you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs a year old without blemish, day by day, as a regular offering.
28-4 The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;
28-5 also <f>ⓓ</f>a tenth of an ephah <f>[1]</f> of fine flour for <f>ⓔ</f>a grain offering, mixed <f>ⓕ</f>with a quarter of a hin <f>[2]</f> of beaten oil.
28-6 It is a <f>ⓖ</f>regular burnt offering, which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.
28-7 Its drink offering shall be a quarter of a hin for each lamb. In the Holy Place you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the LORD.
28-8 The other lamb you shall offer at twilight. Like the grain offering of the morning, and like its drink offering, you shall offer it as a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
28-9 <pb/>“On the Sabbath day, two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, and its drink offering:
28-10 this is <f>ⓗ</f>the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
28-11 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> “At the beginnings of your months, you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls from the herd, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;
28-12 also <f>ⓙ</f>three tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, for each bull, and two tenths of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram;
28-13 and a tenth of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for every lamb; for a burnt offering with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD.
28-14 Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, a third of a hin for a ram, and a quarter of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year.
28-15 Also <f>ⓚ</f>one male goat for a sin offering to the LORD; it shall be offered besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
28-16 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “On the fourteenth day of the first month is the LORD's Passover,
28-17 <f>ⓜ</f> and on the fifteenth day of this month is a feast. Seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
28-18 <f>ⓝ</f> On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall not do any ordinary work,
28-19 but offer a food offering, a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls from the herd, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old; <f>ⓞ</f>see that they are without blemish;
28-20 also their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil; three tenths of an ephah shall you offer for a bull, and two tenths for a ram;
28-21 a tenth shall you offer for each of the seven lambs;
28-22 also <f>ⓟ</f>one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
28-23 You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a regular burnt offering.
28-24 In the same way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD. It shall be offered besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
28-25 And <f>ⓠ</f>on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall not do any ordinary work.
28-26 <pb/>“On <f>ⓡ</f>the day of the firstfruits, when you offer a grain offering of new grain to the LORD at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall not do any ordinary work,
28-27 but offer a burnt offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD: <f>ⓢ</f>two bulls from the herd, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;
28-28 also their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, three tenths of an ephah for each bull, two tenths for one ram,
28-29 a tenth for each of the seven lambs;
28-30 with <f>ⓣ</f>one male goat, to make atonement for you.
28-31 Besides the regular burnt offering and its grain offering, you shall offer them and their drink offering. <f>ⓤ</f>See that they are without blemish.
32-1 <f>[1]</f> <pb/><t> <f>ⓐ</f> Blessed is the one whose <f>ⓑ</f>transgression is forgiven, </t><t>whose sin is covered.</t>
32-2 <t>Blessed is the man against whom the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>counts no iniquity, </t><t>and in whose spirit <f>ⓓ</f>there is no deceit. </t>
32-3 <pb/><t>For when I kept silent, my <f>ⓔ</f>bones wasted away </t><t>through my <f>ⓕ</f>groaning all day long.</t>
32-4 <t>For day and night your <f>ⓖ</f>hand was heavy upon me; </t><t>my strength was dried up <f>[2]</f> as by the heat of summer. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
32-5 <pb/><t>I <f>ⓗ</f>acknowledged my sin to you, </t><t>and I did not cover my iniquity; </t><t>I said, “I <f>ⓘ</f>will confess my transgressions to the LORD,” </t><t>and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
32-6 <pb/><t>Therefore let everyone who is <f>ⓙ</f>godly </t><t>offer prayer to you at a time when you <f>ⓚ</f>may be found; </t><t>surely in the rush of <f>ⓛ</f>great waters, </t><t>they shall not reach him.</t>
32-7 <t>You are a <f>ⓜ</f>hiding place for me; </t><t>you preserve me from <f>ⓝ</f>trouble; </t><t>you surround me with <f>ⓞ</f>shouts of deliverance. <pb/><i>Selah</i> <pb/></t>
32-8 <pb/><t>I will <f>ⓟ</f>instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; </t><t>I will <f>ⓠ</f>counsel you with my eye upon you.</t>
32-9 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding, </t><t>which must be curbed with <f>ⓢ</f>bit and bridle, </t><t>or it will not stay near you. </t>
32-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f> Many are the sorrows of the wicked, </t><t>but steadfast love surrounds the one who <f>ⓤ</f>trusts in the LORD.</t>
32-11 <t><f>ⓥ</f> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, O righteous, </t><t>and <f>ⓦ</f>shout for joy, all you <f>ⓧ</f>upright in heart! </t>
13-1 <pb/><t>When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>he was exalted in Israel, </t><t>but he incurred guilt <f>ⓑ</f>through Baal and died.</t>
13-2 <t>And now they sin more and more, </t><t>and <f>ⓒ</f>make for themselves metal images, </t><t>idols skillfully made of their silver, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>all of them the work of craftsmen. </t><t>It is said of them, </t><t>“Those who offer human sacrifice <f>ⓔ</f>kiss calves!”</t>
13-3 <t>Therefore they shall be <f>ⓕ</f>like the morning mist </t><t>or <f>ⓖ</f>like the dew that goes early away, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>like the chaff that swirls from the threshing floor </t><t>or <f>ⓘ</f>like smoke from a window. </t>

13-5 <t><f>ⓜ</f> It was I who knew you in the wilderness, </t><t>in the land of drought;</t>
13-6 <t><f>ⓝ</f> but when they had grazed, <f>[1]</f> they became full, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>they were filled, and their heart was lifted up; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>therefore they forgot me.</t>
13-7 <t>So <f>ⓠ</f>I am to them like a lion; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>like a leopard I will lurk beside the way.</t>
13-8 <t>I will fall upon them <f>ⓢ</f>like a bear robbed of her cubs; </t><t>I will tear open their breast, </t><t>and there I will devour them like a lion, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>as a wild beast would rip them open. </t>
13-9 <pb/><t>He destroys <f>[2]</f> you, O Israel, </t><t>for you are against me, against <f>ⓤ</f>your helper.</t>
13-10 <t><f>ⓥ</f> Where now is your king, to save you in all your cities? </t><t>Where are all your rulers — </t><t>those of whom <f>ⓦ</f>you said, </t><t>“Give me a king and princes”?</t>
13-11 <t><f>ⓧ</f> I gave you a king in my anger, </t><t>and <f>ⓨ</f>I took him away in my wrath. </t>

13-13 <t><f>ⓑ</f> The pangs of childbirth come for him, </t><t>but he is an unwise son, </t><t>for at the right time he does not present himself </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>at the opening of the womb. </t>
13-14 <pb/><t><f>ⓓ</f> I shall ransom them from the power of Sheol; </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>I shall redeem them from Death. <f>[3]</f> </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>O <f>ⓖ</f>Death, where are your plagues? </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>O <f>ⓘ</f>Sheol, where is your sting? </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>Compassion is hidden from my eyes. </t>
13-15 <pb/><t>Though <f>ⓚ</f>he may flourish among his brothers, </t><t><f>ⓛ</f>the east wind, the wind of the LORD, shall come, </t><t>rising from the wilderness, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and his fountain shall dry up; </t><t>his spring shall be parched; </t><t>it shall strip <f>ⓝ</f>his treasury </t><t>of every precious thing.</t>
