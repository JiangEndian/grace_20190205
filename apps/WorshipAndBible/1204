16-1 <pb/>When David had passed a little beyond <f>ⓐ</f>the summit, <f>ⓑ</f>Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, bearing two hundred loaves of bread, <f>ⓒ</f>a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred of summer fruits, and a skin of wine.
16-2 And the king said to Ziba, “Why have you brought these?” Ziba answered, <f>ⓓ</f>“The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who <f>ⓔ</f>faint in the wilderness to drink.”
16-3 And the king said, “And where is your master's son?” <f>ⓕ</f>Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he remains in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.’”
16-4 Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.” And Ziba said, “I pay homage; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king.”
16-5 <pb/>When King David came to <f>ⓖ</f>Bahurim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was <f>ⓗ</f>Shimei, the son of Gera, and as he came <f>ⓘ</f>he cursed continually.
16-6 And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
16-7 And Shimei said as he <f>ⓙ</f>cursed, “Get out, get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!
16-8 The LORD <f>ⓚ</f>has avenged on you all <f>ⓛ</f>the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood.”
16-9 <pb/>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this <f>ⓜ</f>dead dog <f>ⓝ</f>curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.”
16-10 But the king said, <f>ⓞ</f>“What have I to do with you, <f>ⓟ</f>you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, ‘Curse David,’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”
16-11 And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, <f>ⓠ</f>my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Leave him alone, and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.
16-12 It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me, <f>[1]</f> and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today.”
16-13 So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and <f>ⓡ</f>cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust.
16-14 And the king, and all the people who were with him, <f>ⓢ</f>arrived weary at the Jordan. <f>[2]</f> And there he refreshed himself.
16-15 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
16-16 And when Hushai the Archite, <f>ⓤ</f>David's friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, <f>ⓥ</f>“Long live the king! Long live the king!”
16-17 And Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? <f>ⓦ</f>Why did you not go with your friend?”
16-18 And Hushai said to Absalom, “No, for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain.
16-19 And again, <f>ⓧ</f>whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you.”
16-20 <pb/>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel. What shall we do?”
16-21 Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to <f>ⓨ</f>your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and <f>ⓩ</f>the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.”
16-22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom <f>ⓐ</f>on the roof. And Absalom went in to his father's concubines <f>ⓑ</f>in the sight of all Israel.
16-23 Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed, <f>ⓒ</f>both by David and by Absalom.
20-1 <pb/><t><pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Wine is a mocker, <f>ⓑ</f>strong drink a brawler, </t><t>and whoever <f>ⓒ</f>is led astray by it is not wise. <f>[1]</f></t>
20-2 <t>The terror of a king is like <f>ⓓ</f>the growling of a lion; </t><t>whoever provokes him to anger <f>ⓔ</f>forfeits his life.</t>
20-3 <t>It is an honor for a man to <f>ⓕ</f>keep aloof from strife, </t><t>but every fool will be quarreling.</t>
20-4 <t><f>ⓖ</f> The sluggard does not plow in the autumn; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>he will seek at harvest and have nothing.</t>
20-5 <t>The purpose in a man's heart is like <f>ⓘ</f>deep water, </t><t>but a man of understanding will draw it out.</t>
20-6 <t>Many a man <f>ⓙ</f>proclaims his own steadfast love, </t><t>but <f>ⓚ</f>a faithful man who can find?</t>
20-7 <t>The righteous who <f>ⓛ</f>walks in his integrity — </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>blessed are his children after him!</t>
20-8 <t><f>ⓝ</f> A king who sits on the throne of judgment </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>winnows all evil with his eyes.</t>
20-9 <t><f>ⓟ</f> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure; </t><t>I am clean from my sin”?</t>
20-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Unequal <f>[2]</f> weights and unequal measures </t><t>are both alike an abomination to the LORD.</t>
20-11 <t>Even a child <f>ⓡ</f>makes himself known by his acts, </t><t>by whether his conduct is pure and upright. <f>[3]</f></t>
20-12 <t><f>ⓢ</f> The hearing ear and the seeing eye, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>the LORD has made them both.</t>
20-13 <t><f>ⓤ</f> Love not sleep, lest you <f>ⓥ</f>come to poverty; </t><t>open your eyes, and you will have <f>ⓦ</f>plenty of bread.</t>
20-14 <t>“Bad, bad,” says the buyer, </t><t>but when he goes away, then he boasts.</t>
20-15 <t>There is gold and abundance of <f>ⓧ</f>costly stones, </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</t>
20-16 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Take a man's garment when he has put up security for a stranger, </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>hold it in pledge when he puts up security for foreigners. <f>[4]</f></t>
20-17 <t><f>ⓑ</f> Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man, </t><t>but afterward his mouth will be full of <f>ⓒ</f>gravel.</t>
20-18 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Plans are established by counsel; </t><t>by <f>ⓔ</f>wise guidance <f>ⓕ</f>wage war.</t>
20-19 <t>Whoever <f>ⓖ</f>goes about slandering reveals secrets; </t><t>therefore do not associate with <f>ⓗ</f>a simple babbler. <f>[5]</f></t>
20-20 <t><f>ⓘ</f> If one curses his father or his mother, </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>his lamp will be put out in utter darkness.</t>
20-21 <t><f>ⓚ</f> An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning </t><t>will not be blessed in the end.</t>
20-22 <t>Do not say, <f>ⓛ</f>“I will repay evil”; </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>wait for the LORD, and he will deliver you.</t>
20-23 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Unequal weights are an abomination to the LORD, </t><t>and <f>ⓞ</f>false scales are not good.</t>
20-24 <t>A man's <f>ⓟ</f>steps are from the LORD; </t><t>how then can man understand his way?</t>
20-25 <t>It is a snare to say rashly, “It is holy,” </t><t>and to reflect only <f>ⓠ</f>after making vows.</t>
20-26 <t>A wise king <f>ⓡ</f>winnows the wicked </t><t>and drives <f>ⓢ</f>the wheel over them.</t>
20-27 <t><f>ⓣ</f> The spirit <f>[6]</f> of man is the lamp of the LORD, </t><t><f>ⓤ</f>searching all <f>ⓥ</f>his innermost parts.</t>
20-28 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king, </t><t>and by steadfast love his <f>ⓧ</f>throne is upheld.</t>
20-29 <t>The glory of young men is their strength, </t><t>but <f>ⓨ</f>the splendor of old men is their gray hair.</t>
20-30 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Blows that wound cleanse away evil; </t><t>strokes make clean <f>ⓐ</f>the innermost parts. </t>
16-1 <pb/><J>“I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling away.</J>
16-2 <J><f>ⓐ</f> They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, <f>ⓑ</f>the hour is coming when <f>ⓒ</f>whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.</J>
16-3 <J>And they will do these things <f>ⓓ</f>because they have not known the Father, nor me.</J>
16-4 <J>But <f>ⓔ</f>I have said these things to you, that when <f>ⓕ</f>their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you. <pb/><e>The Work of the Holy Spirit</e> </pb></J> <pb/><J>“I did not say these things to you from the beginning, <f>ⓖ</f>because I was with you.</J>

16-7 <J>Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for <f>ⓚ</f>if I do not go away, <f>ⓛ</f>the Helper will not come to you. But <f>ⓜ</f>if <f>ⓝ</f>I go, <f>ⓞ</f>I will send him to you.</J>

16-10 <J><f>ⓢ</f> concerning righteousness, <f>ⓣ</f>because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer;</J>
16-11 <J><f>ⓤ</f> concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world <f>ⓥ</f>is judged.</J>
16-12 <pb/><J>“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</J>
16-13 <J>When <f>ⓦ</f>the Spirit of truth comes, <f>ⓧ</f>he will <f>ⓨ</f>guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but <f>ⓩ</f>whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.</J>
16-14 <J>He will <f>ⓐ</f>glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</J>
16-15 <J><f>ⓑ</f> All that the Father has is mine; <f>ⓒ</f>therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</J>
16-16 <pb/><J><f>ⓓ</f> “A little while, and you will see me no longer; and <f>ⓔ</f>again a little while, and you will see me.”</J>
16-17 So <f>ⓕ</f>some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, <J> <f>ⓖ</f>‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’;</J> and, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>‘because I am going to the Father’</J>?”
16-18 So they were saying, “What does he mean by <J>‘a little while’</J>? <f>ⓘ</f>We do not know what he is talking about.”
16-19 <f>ⓙ</f> Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, <J>“Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, ‘A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me’?</J>
16-20 <J>Truly, truly, I say to you, <f>ⓚ</f>you will weep and lament, but <f>ⓛ</f>the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but <f>ⓜ</f>your sorrow will turn into joy.</J>
16-21 <J><f>ⓝ</f> When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world.</J>
16-22 <J><f>ⓞ</f> So also you have sorrow now, but <f>ⓟ</f>I will see you again, and <f>ⓠ</f>your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.</J>
