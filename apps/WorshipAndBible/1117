30-1 <pb/>Now when David and his men came to <f>ⓐ</f>Ziklag on the third day, <f>ⓑ</f>the Amalekites had <f>ⓒ</f>made a raid against the Negeb and against Ziklag. They had overcome Ziklag and burned it with fire
30-2 and taken captive the women and all <f>[1]</f> who were in it, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off and went their way.
30-3 And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
30-4 Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep.
30-5 David's <f>ⓓ</f>two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
30-6 And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke <f>ⓔ</f>of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, <f>[2]</f> each for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.
30-7 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
30-8 <f>ⓖ</f> And David inquired of the LORD, “Shall I pursue after this <f>ⓗ</f>band? Shall I overtake them?” He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake <f>ⓘ</f>and shall surely rescue.”
30-9 So David set out, and <f>ⓙ</f>the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
30-10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men. <f>ⓚ</f>Two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.
30-11 <pb/>They found an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David. And they gave him bread and he ate. They gave him water to drink,
30-12 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, <f>ⓛ</f>his spirit revived, for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
30-13 And David said to him, “To whom do you belong? And where are you from?” He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite, and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.
30-14 <f>ⓜ</f> We had made a raid against the Negeb of <f>ⓝ</f>the Cherethites and against that which belongs to Judah and against the Negeb of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.”
30-15 And David said to him, “Will you take me down to this band?” And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this <f>ⓞ</f>band.”
30-16 <pb/>And when he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
30-17 And David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day, and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who mounted camels and fled.
30-18 <f>ⓟ</f> David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and David rescued his two wives.
30-19 Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken. <f>ⓠ</f>David brought back all.
30-20 David also captured all the flocks and herds, and the people drove the livestock before him, <f>[3]</f> and said, “This is David's spoil.”
30-21 <pb/>Then David came to <f>ⓡ</f>the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and who had been left <f>ⓢ</f>at the brook Besor. And they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. And when David came near to the people he greeted them.
30-22 Then all the wicked and worthless fellows among the men who had gone with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except that each man may lead away his wife and children, and depart.”
30-23 But David said, “You shall not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us. He has preserved us and given into our hand the band that came against us.
30-24 Who would listen to you in this matter? <f>ⓣ</f>For as his share is who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage. They shall share alike.”
30-25 And he made it a statute and a rule for Israel from that day forward to this day.
30-26 <pb/>When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD.”
30-27 It was for those in <f>ⓤ</f>Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negeb, in <f>ⓥ</f>Jattir,
30-28 in <f>ⓦ</f>Aroer, in Siphmoth, in <f>ⓧ</f>Eshtemoa,
30-29 in Racal, in the cities of <f>ⓨ</f>the Jerahmeelites, in the cities of <f>ⓩ</f>the Kenites,
30-30 in <f>ⓐ</f>Hormah, in Bor-ashan, in Athach,
30-31 in <f>ⓑ</f>Hebron, for all the places where David and his men had roamed.
3-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> My son, do not forget my teaching, </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>but let your heart keep my commandments,</t>
3-2 <t>for <f>ⓒ</f>length of days and years of life </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>peace they will add to you. </t>
3-3 <pb/><t>Let not <f>ⓔ</f>steadfast love and <f>ⓕ</f>faithfulness forsake you; </t><t><f>ⓖ</f>bind them around your neck; </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>write them on the tablet of your heart.</t>
3-4 <t>So you will <f>ⓘ</f>find favor and <f>ⓙ</f>good success <f>[1]</f> </t><t>in the sight of God and man. </t>
3-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓚ</f> Trust in the LORD with all your heart, </t><t>and <f>ⓛ</f>do not lean on your own understanding.</t>
3-6 <t>In all your ways <f>ⓜ</f>acknowledge him, </t><t>and he <f>ⓝ</f>will make straight your paths.</t>
3-7 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Be not wise in your own eyes; </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.</t>
3-8 <t>It will be <f>ⓠ</f>healing to your flesh <f>[2]</f> </t><t>and <f>ⓡ</f>refreshment <f>[3]</f> to your bones. </t>
3-9 <pb/><t>Honor the LORD with your wealth </t><t>and with <f>ⓢ</f>the firstfruits of all your produce;</t>
3-10 <t>then your <f>ⓣ</f>barns will be filled with plenty, </t><t>and your vats will be bursting with wine. </t>
3-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓤ</f> My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline </t><t>or be weary of his reproof,</t>
3-12 <t>for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, </t><t>as <f>ⓥ</f>a father the son in whom he delights. </t>
3-13 <pb/><t><f>ⓦ</f> Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, </t><t>and the one who gets understanding,</t>
3-14 <t><f>ⓧ</f> for the gain from her is better than gain from silver </t><t>and her profit better than <f>ⓨ</f>gold.</t>
3-15 <t>She is more precious than <f>ⓩ</f>jewels, </t><t>and <f>ⓐ</f>nothing you desire can compare with her.</t>
3-16 <t><f>ⓑ</f> Long life is in her right hand; </t><t>in her left hand are <f>ⓒ</f>riches and honor.</t>
3-17 <t>Her <f>ⓓ</f>ways are ways of pleasantness, </t><t>and all her paths are peace.</t>
3-18 <t>She is <f>ⓔ</f>a tree of life to those who <f>ⓕ</f>lay hold of her; </t><t>those who hold her fast are called blessed. </t>
3-19 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; </t><t>by understanding <f>ⓗ</f>he established the heavens;</t>
3-20 <t>by his knowledge <f>ⓘ</f>the deeps broke open, </t><t>and <f>ⓙ</f>the clouds drop down the dew. </t>
3-21 <pb/><t>My son, <f>ⓚ</f>do not lose sight of these — </t><t>keep sound wisdom and discretion,</t>
3-22 <t>and they will be <f>ⓛ</f>life for your soul </t><t>and <f>ⓜ</f>adornment for your neck.</t>
3-23 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Then you will walk on your way securely, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>and your foot will not stumble.</t>
3-24 <t><f>ⓟ</f> If you lie down, you will not be afraid; </t><t>when you lie down, <f>ⓠ</f>your sleep will be sweet.</t>
3-25 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Do not be afraid of sudden terror </t><t>or of <f>ⓢ</f>the ruin <f>[4]</f> of the wicked, when it comes,</t>
3-26 <t>for the LORD will be your confidence </t><t>and will <f>ⓣ</f>keep your foot from being caught.</t>
3-27 <t><f>ⓤ</f> Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, <f>[5]</f> </t><t>when it is in your power to do it. </t>
3-28 <pb/><t><f>ⓥ</f> Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again, </t><t>tomorrow I will give it” — when you have it with you.</t>
3-29 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Do not plan evil against your neighbor, </t><t>who <f>ⓧ</f>dwells trustingly beside you.</t>
3-30 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Do not contend with a man for no reason, </t><t>when he has done you no harm.</t>
3-31 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Do not envy <f>ⓐ</f>a man of violence </t><t>and do not choose any of his ways,</t>
3-32 <t>for <f>ⓑ</f>the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, </t><t>but the upright are <f>ⓒ</f>in his confidence.</t>
3-33 <t><f>ⓓ</f> The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, </t><t>but he <f>ⓔ</f>blesses the dwelling of the righteous.</t>
3-34 <t>Toward the <f>ⓕ</f>scorners he <f>ⓖ</f>is scornful, </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>but to the humble he gives favor. <f>[6]</f></t>
3-35 <t>The wise will inherit honor, </t><t>but fools get <f>[7]</f> disgrace. </t>
23-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate.
23-2 And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man <f>ⓑ</f>misleading our nation and <f>ⓒ</f>forbidding us to give tribute to <f>ⓓ</f>Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, <f>ⓔ</f>a king.”
23-3 <f>ⓕ</f> And Pilate asked him, <f>ⓖ</f>“Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, <J> <f>ⓗ</f>“You have said so.”</J>
23-4 Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, <f>ⓘ</f>“I find no guilt in this man.”
23-5 But they were urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, <f>ⓙ</f>from Galilee even to this place.”
23-6 <pb/>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
23-7 And when he learned that he belonged to <f>ⓚ</f>Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.
23-8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, <f>ⓛ</f>for he had long desired to see him, <f>ⓜ</f>because he had heard about him, and he was hoping <f>ⓝ</f>to see some sign done by him.
23-9 So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer.
23-10 The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.
23-11 And Herod with his soldiers <f>ⓞ</f>treated him with contempt and <f>ⓟ</f>mocked him. Then, <f>ⓠ</f>arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.
23-12 And <f>ⓡ</f>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.
23-13 <pb/>Pilate then called together the chief priests and <f>ⓢ</f>the rulers and the people,
23-14 and said to them, “You brought me this man <f>ⓣ</f>as one who was misleading the people. And <f>ⓤ</f>after examining him before you, behold, I <f>ⓥ</f>did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him.
23-15 Neither did Herod, for <f>ⓦ</f>he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him.
23-16 <f>ⓧ</f> I will therefore punish and release him.” <f>[1]</f>
23-17 
23-18 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> But they all cried out together, <f>ⓩ</f>“Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas” —
23-19 a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and <f>ⓐ</f>for murder.
23-20 Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus,
23-21 but they kept shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!”
23-22 A third time he said to them, “Why? <f>ⓑ</f>What evil has he done? <f>ⓒ</f>I have found in him no guilt deserving death. <f>ⓓ</f>I will therefore punish and release him.”
23-23 But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
23-24 So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.
23-25 He released the man who had been thrown into prison <f>ⓔ</f>for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, <f>ⓕ</f>but he delivered Jesus over to their will.
23-26 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.
23-27 And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were <f>ⓗ</f>mourning and lamenting for him.
23-28 But turning to them Jesus said, <J>“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</J>
23-29 <J>For behold, <f>ⓘ</f>the days are coming when they will say, <f>ⓙ</f>‘Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’</J>
23-30 <J><f>ⓚ</f> Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’</J>
23-31 <J>For <f>ⓛ</f>if they do these things when <f>ⓜ</f>the wood is green, what will happen <f>ⓝ</f>when it is dry?”</J>
23-32 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.
23-33 <f>ⓟ</f> And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, <f>ⓠ</f>one on his right and one on his left.
23-34 And Jesus said, <J>“Father, <f>ⓡ</f>forgive them, <f>ⓢ</f>for they know not what they do.” <f>[2]</f></J> And they cast lots <f>ⓣ</f>to divide his garments.
23-35 And <f>ⓤ</f>the people stood by, watching, <f>ⓥ</f>but <f>ⓦ</f>the rulers <f>ⓧ</f>scoffed at him, saying, <f>ⓨ</f>“He saved others; <f>ⓩ</f>let him save himself, <f>ⓐ</f>if he is <f>ⓑ</f>the Christ of God, <f>ⓒ</f>his Chosen One!”
23-36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and <f>ⓓ</f>offering him sour wine
23-37 and saying, <f>ⓔ</f>“If you are <f>ⓕ</f>the King of the Jews, save yourself!”
23-38 <f>ⓖ</f> There was also an inscription over him, <f>[3]</f> “This is <f>ⓗ</f>the King of the Jews.”
23-39 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> One of the criminals who were hanged <f>ⓙ</f>railed at him, <f>[4]</f> saying, “Are you not <f>ⓚ</f>the Christ? Save yourself and us!”
23-40 But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
23-41 And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.”
23-42 And he said, “Jesus, remember me <f>ⓛ</f>when you come into your kingdom.”
23-43 And he said to him, <J>“Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in <f>ⓜ</f>paradise.”</J>
23-44 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> It was now about the sixth hour, <f>[5]</f> and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, <f>[6]</f>
23-45 while the sun's light failed. And <f>ⓞ</f>the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
23-46 Then Jesus, <f>ⓟ</f>calling out with a loud voice, said, <J>“Father, <f>ⓠ</f>into your hands I <f>ⓡ</f>commit my spirit!”</J> And having said this <f>ⓢ</f>he breathed his last.
23-47 Now <f>ⓣ</f>when the centurion saw what had taken place, <f>ⓤ</f>he praised God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent!”
23-48 And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home <f>ⓥ</f>beating their breasts.
23-49 And all <f>ⓦ</f>his acquaintances and <f>ⓧ</f>the women who had followed him from Galilee <f>ⓨ</f>stood at a distance watching these things.
23-50 <pb/><f>ⓩ</f> Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,
23-51 who had not consented to their decision and action; and he <f>ⓐ</f>was looking for the kingdom of God.
23-52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
23-53 Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and <f>ⓑ</f>laid him in a tomb cut in stone, <f>ⓒ</f>where no one had ever yet been laid.
23-54 It was the day of <f>ⓓ</f>Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning. <f>[7]</f>
23-55 <f>ⓔ</f> The women <f>ⓕ</f>who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
23-56 Then they returned and <f>ⓖ</f>prepared spices and ointments. <pb/>On the Sabbath they rested <f>ⓗ</f>according to the commandment.
