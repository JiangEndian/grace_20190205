22-1 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
22-2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons so that they <f>ⓐ</f>abstain from the holy things of the people of Israel, which they <f>ⓑ</f>dedicate to me, so that they do not <f>ⓒ</f>profane my holy name: I am the LORD.
22-3 Say to them, ‘If any one of all your offspring throughout your generations approaches the holy things that the people of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while <f>ⓓ</f>he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
22-4 None of the offspring of Aaron who has a leprous disease or a <f>ⓔ</f>discharge may eat of the holy things <f>ⓕ</f>until he is clean. <f>ⓖ</f>Whoever touches anything that is unclean through contact with the dead or <f>ⓗ</f>a man who has had an emission of semen,
22-5 and <f>ⓘ</f>whoever touches a swarming thing by which he may be made unclean or <f>ⓙ</f>a person from whom he may take uncleanness, whatever his uncleanness may be —
22-6 the person who touches such a thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has <f>ⓚ</f>bathed his body in water.
22-7 When the sun goes down he shall be clean, and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because <f>ⓛ</f>they are his food.
22-8 <f>ⓜ</f> He shall not eat what dies of itself or is torn by beasts, and so make himself unclean by it: I am the LORD.’
22-9 They shall therefore keep my charge, <f>ⓝ</f>lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: <f>ⓞ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
22-10 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> “A lay person shall not eat of a holy thing; no foreign guest of the priest or hired worker shall eat of a holy thing,
22-11 but if a priest buys a slave <f>[1]</f> as his property for money, the slave <f>[2]</f> may eat of it, and <f>ⓠ</f>anyone born in his house may eat of his food.
22-12 If a priest's daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy things.
22-13 But if a priest's daughter is widowed or divorced and has no child and <f>ⓡ</f>returns to her father's house, <f>ⓢ</f>as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; yet no lay person shall eat of it.
22-14 <f>ⓣ</f> And if anyone eats of a holy thing unintentionally, he shall add <f>ⓤ</f>the fifth of its value to it and give the holy thing to the priest.
22-15 They <f>ⓥ</f>shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, which they contribute to the LORD,
22-16 and so cause them <f>ⓦ</f>to bear iniquity and guilt, by eating their holy things: <f>ⓧ</f>for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”
22-17 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
22-18 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them, <f>ⓨ</f>When any one of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel presents a burnt offering as his offering, for any of their vows or freewill offerings that they offer to the LORD,
22-19 if it is to be accepted for you it shall be a <f>ⓩ</f>male without blemish, of the bulls or the sheep or the goats.
22-20 <f>ⓐ</f> You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable for you.
22-21 And when anyone <f>ⓑ</f>offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock, to be accepted it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it.
22-22 Animals <f>ⓓ</f>blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or <f>ⓔ</f>an itch or scabs you shall not offer to the LORD or give them to the LORD as a food <f>ⓕ</f>offering on the altar.
22-23 You may present a bull or a lamb that has a part <f>ⓖ</f>too long or too short for a freewill offering, but for a vow offering it cannot be accepted.
22-24 Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not offer to the LORD; you shall not do it within your land,
22-25 neither shall you offer as <f>ⓗ</f>the bread of your God any such animals gotten from a foreigner. Since there is a <f>ⓘ</f>blemish in them, because of their mutilation, they will not be accepted for you.”
22-26 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
22-27 <f>ⓙ</f> “When an ox or sheep or goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as a food offering to the LORD.
22-28 But you shall not kill an ox or a sheep <f>ⓚ</f>and her young in one day.
22-29 And when you sacrifice a <f>ⓛ</f>sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
22-30 It shall be eaten on the same day; <f>ⓜ</f>you shall leave none of it until morning: I am the LORD.
22-31 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> “So you shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the LORD.
22-32 <f>ⓞ</f> And you shall not profane my holy name, that <f>ⓟ</f>I may be sanctified among the people of Israel. <f>ⓠ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies you,
22-33 who brought you out of the land of Egypt <f>ⓡ</f>to be your God: I am the LORD.”
41-1 <pb/><t><f>[1]</f> “Can you draw out <f>ⓐ</f>Leviathan <f>[2]</f> with a fishhook </t><t>or press down his tongue with a cord?</t>
41-2 <t>Can you put <f>ⓑ</f>a rope in his nose </t><t>or pierce his jaw with <f>ⓒ</f>a hook?</t>
41-3 <t>Will he make many pleas to you? </t><t>Will he speak to you soft words?</t>
41-4 <t>Will he make a covenant with you </t><t>to take him for <f>ⓓ</f>your servant forever?</t>
41-5 <t>Will you play with him as with a bird, </t><t>or will you put him on a leash for your girls?</t>
41-6 <t>Will traders bargain over him? </t><t>Will they divide him up among the merchants?</t>
41-7 <t>Can you fill his skin with harpoons </t><t>or his head with fishing spears?</t>
41-8 <t>Lay your hands on him; </t><t>remember the battle — you will not do it again!</t>
41-9 <t><f>[3]</f> Behold, the hope of a man is false; </t><t>he is laid low even at the sight of him.</t>
41-10 <t>No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up. </t><t>Who then is he who can stand before me?</t>
41-11 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine. </t>
41-12 <pb/><t>“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, </t><t>or his mighty strength, or his goodly frame.</t>
41-13 <t>Who can strip off his outer garment? </t><t>Who would come near him with a bridle?</t>
41-14 <t>Who can open the doors of his face? </t><t>Around his teeth is terror.</t>
41-15 <t>His back is made of <f>[4]</f> rows of shields, </t><t>shut up closely as with a seal.</t>
41-16 <t>One is so near to another </t><t>that no air can come between them.</t>
41-17 <t>They are <f>ⓖ</f>joined one to another; </t><t>they clasp each other and cannot be separated.</t>
41-18 <t>His sneezings flash forth light, </t><t>and his eyes are like <f>ⓗ</f>the eyelids of the dawn.</t>
41-19 <t>Out of his mouth go flaming torches; </t><t>sparks of fire leap forth.</t>
41-20 <t>Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke, </t><t>as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.</t>
41-21 <t>His breath <f>ⓘ</f>kindles coals, </t><t>and a flame comes forth from his mouth.</t>
41-22 <t>In his neck abides strength, </t><t>and terror dances before him.</t>
41-23 <t>The folds of his flesh <f>ⓙ</f>stick together, </t><t>firmly cast on him and immovable.</t>
41-24 <t>His heart is hard as a stone, </t><t>hard as the lower millstone.</t>
41-25 <t>When he raises himself up, the mighty <f>[5]</f> are afraid; </t><t>at the crashing they are beside themselves.</t>
41-26 <t>Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail, </t><t>nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.</t>
41-27 <t>He counts iron as straw, </t><t>and bronze as rotten wood.</t>
41-28 <t>The arrow cannot make him flee; </t><t>for him, sling stones are turned to stubble.</t>
41-29 <t>Clubs are counted as stubble; </t><t>he laughs at the rattle of javelins.</t>
41-30 <t>His underparts are like sharp <f>ⓚ</f>potsherds; </t><t>he spreads himself like <f>ⓛ</f>a threshing sledge on the mire.</t>
41-31 <t>He makes the deep boil like a pot; </t><t>he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</t>
41-32 <t>Behind him he leaves a shining wake; </t><t>one would think the deep to be white-haired.</t>
41-33 <t><f>ⓜ</f> On earth there is not his like, </t><t>a creature without fear.</t>
41-34 <t>He sees everything that is high; </t><t>he is king over all the <f>ⓝ</f>sons of pride.” </t>
40-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the twenty-fifth year <f>ⓑ</f>of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, <f>ⓒ</f>in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day, <f>ⓓ</f>the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me to the city. <f>[1]</f>
40-2 In <f>ⓔ</f>visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on <f>ⓕ</f>a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south.
40-3 When he brought me there, behold, there was <f>ⓖ</f>a man whose appearance was <f>ⓗ</f>like bronze, with <f>ⓘ</f>a linen cord and <f>ⓙ</f>a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway.
40-4 And the man said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“Son of man, <f>ⓛ</f>look with your eyes, and <f>ⓜ</f>hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. <f>ⓝ</f>Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”
40-5 <pb/>And behold, there was <f>ⓞ</f>a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man's hand was six long cubits, <f>ⓟ</f>each being a cubit and a handbreadth <f>[2]</f> in length. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.
40-6 Then he went into <f>ⓠ</f>the gateway facing east, <f>ⓡ</f>going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep. <f>[3]</f>
40-7 And <f>ⓢ</f>the side rooms, one reed long and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed.
40-8 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, on the inside, one reed.
40-9 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; <f>ⓣ</f>and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.
40-10 And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate. <f>ⓤ</f>The three were of the same size, and the jambs on either side were of the same size.
40-11 Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gateway, thirteen cubits.
40-12 There was a barrier before the side rooms, one cubit on either side. And the side rooms were six cubits on either side.
40-13 Then he measured the gate from the ceiling of the one side room to the ceiling of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits; the openings faced each other.
40-14 He measured also <f>ⓥ</f>the vestibule, sixty cubits. And around the vestibule of the gateway was the court. <f>[4]</f>
40-15 From the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
40-16 And the gateway had <f>ⓦ</f>windows all around, narrowing inwards toward the side rooms and toward their <f>ⓧ</f>jambs, and likewise the vestibule had windows all around inside, and on the jambs were <f>ⓨ</f>palm trees.
40-17 <pb/>Then he brought me into <f>ⓩ</f>the outer court. And behold, there were <f>ⓐ</f>chambers and a <f>ⓑ</f>pavement, all around the court. <f>ⓒ</f>Thirty chambers faced the pavement.
40-18 And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. This was the lower pavement.
40-19 Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, <f>[5]</f> a hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side. <f>[6]</f>
40-20 <pb/>As for <f>ⓓ</f>the gate that faced toward the north, belonging to <f>ⓔ</f>the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth.
40-21 Its <f>ⓕ</f>side rooms, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of <f>ⓖ</f>the first gate. Its length was <f>ⓗ</f>fifty cubits, and its breadth <f>ⓘ</f>twenty-five cubits.
40-22 And <f>ⓙ</f>its windows, its vestibule, and <f>ⓚ</f>its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate that faced toward the east. And by seven steps <f>ⓛ</f>people would go up to it, and find its vestibule before them.
40-23 And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to <f>ⓜ</f>the inner court. And <f>ⓝ</f>he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits.
40-24 <pb/>And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south. And <f>ⓞ</f>he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others.
40-25 Both it and its vestibule <f>ⓟ</f>had windows all around, like the windows of the others. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
40-26 And there were seven steps leading up to it, and its vestibule was before them, and it had <f>ⓠ</f>palm trees on its jambs, one on either side.
40-27 And there was a gate on the south of <f>ⓡ</f>the inner court. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.
40-28 <pb/>Then he brought me to <f>ⓢ</f>the inner court through the south gate, and <f>ⓣ</f>he measured the south gate. It was of the same size as the others.
40-29 Its <f>ⓤ</f>side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and both it and its vestibule <f>ⓥ</f>had windows all around. <f>ⓦ</f>Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
40-30 And there were vestibules all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad.
40-31 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and <f>ⓧ</f>palm trees were on its jambs, and <f>ⓨ</f>its stairway had eight steps.
40-32 <pb/>Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and <f>ⓩ</f>he measured the gate. It was of the same size as the others.
40-33 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, and both it and its vestibule had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
40-34 <f>ⓐ</f> Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.
40-35 <pb/>Then he brought me to <f>ⓑ</f>the north gate, and <f>ⓒ</f>he measured it. It had the same size as the others.
40-36 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others, <f>[7]</f> and it had windows all around. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
40-37 Its vestibule <f>[8]</f> faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, on either side, and its stairway had eight steps.
40-38 <pb/>There was <f>ⓓ</f>a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, <f>[9]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>where the burnt offering was to be washed.
40-39 And in the vestibule of the gate were two <f>ⓕ</f>tables on either side, on which the <f>ⓖ</f>burnt offering and the <f>ⓗ</f>sin offering and the <f>ⓘ</f>guilt offering were to be slaughtered.
40-40 And off to the side, on the outside as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and off to the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables.
40-41 <f>ⓙ</f> Four tables were on either side of the gate, eight tables, <f>ⓚ</f>on which to slaughter.
40-42 And there were four tables <f>ⓛ</f>of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the <f>ⓜ</f>burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered.
40-43 And hooks, <f>[10]</f> a handbreadth long, were fastened all around within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.
40-44 <pb/>On the outside of the inner gateway there were two <f>ⓝ</f>chambers <f>[11]</f> in the <f>ⓞ</f>inner court, one <f>[12]</f> at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south <f>[13]</f> gate facing north.
40-45 And he said to me, “This chamber that faces south is for the priests <f>ⓟ</f>who have charge of the temple,
40-46 and the chamber that faces north is for the priests <f>ⓠ</f>who have charge of the altar. These are <f>ⓡ</f>the sons of Zadok, who alone <f>[14]</f> among the sons of Levi may come <f>ⓢ</f>near to the LORD to minister to him.”
40-47 And he measured the court, <f>ⓣ</f>a hundred cubits long and <f>ⓤ</f>a hundred cubits broad, a square. And <f>ⓥ</f>the altar was in front of the temple.
40-48 <pb/>Then he brought me to <f>ⓦ</f>the vestibule of the temple and measured the <f>ⓧ</f>jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side. And the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits, and the sidewalls of the gate <f>[15]</f> were three cubits on either side.
40-49 <f>ⓨ</f> The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve <f>[16]</f> cubits, and people would go up to it by ten steps. <f>[17]</f> And there were pillars beside the jambs, one on either side.
