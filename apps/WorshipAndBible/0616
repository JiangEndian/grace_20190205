Leviticus 22-1 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22-2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons so that they <f>ⓐ</f>abstain from the holy things of the people of Israel, which they <f>ⓑ</f>dedicate to me, so that they do not <f>ⓒ</f>profane my holy name: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22-3 Say to them, ‘If any one of all your offspring throughout your generations approaches the holy things that the people of Israel dedicate to the LORD, while <f>ⓓ</f>he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22-4 None of the offspring of Aaron who has a leprous disease or a <f>ⓔ</f>discharge may eat of the holy things <f>ⓕ</f>until he is clean. <f>ⓖ</f>Whoever touches anything that is unclean through contact with the dead or <f>ⓗ</f>a man who has had an emission of semen,
Leviticus 22-5 and <f>ⓘ</f>whoever touches a swarming thing by which he may be made unclean or <f>ⓙ</f>a person from whom he may take uncleanness, whatever his uncleanness may be —
Leviticus 22-6 the person who touches such a thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has <f>ⓚ</f>bathed his body in water.
Leviticus 22-7 When the sun goes down he shall be clean, and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because <f>ⓛ</f>they are his food.
Leviticus 22-8 <f>ⓜ</f> He shall not eat what dies of itself or is torn by beasts, and so make himself unclean by it: I am the LORD.’
Leviticus 22-9 They shall therefore keep my charge, <f>ⓝ</f>lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: <f>ⓞ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
Leviticus 22-10 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> “A lay person shall not eat of a holy thing; no foreign guest of the priest or hired worker shall eat of a holy thing,
Leviticus 22-11 but if a priest buys a slave <f>[1]</f> as his property for money, the slave <f>[2]</f> may eat of it, and <f>ⓠ</f>anyone born in his house may eat of his food.
Leviticus 22-12 If a priest's daughter marries a layman, she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy things.
Leviticus 22-13 But if a priest's daughter is widowed or divorced and has no child and <f>ⓡ</f>returns to her father's house, <f>ⓢ</f>as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; yet no lay person shall eat of it.
Leviticus 22-14 <f>ⓣ</f> And if anyone eats of a holy thing unintentionally, he shall add <f>ⓤ</f>the fifth of its value to it and give the holy thing to the priest.
Leviticus 22-15 They <f>ⓥ</f>shall not profane the holy things of the people of Israel, which they contribute to the LORD,
Leviticus 22-16 and so cause them <f>ⓦ</f>to bear iniquity and guilt, by eating their holy things: <f>ⓧ</f>for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”
Leviticus 22-17 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22-18 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel and say to them, <f>ⓨ</f>When any one of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel presents a burnt offering as his offering, for any of their vows or freewill offerings that they offer to the LORD,
Leviticus 22-19 if it is to be accepted for you it shall be a <f>ⓩ</f>male without blemish, of the bulls or the sheep or the goats.
Leviticus 22-20 <f>ⓐ</f> You shall not offer anything that has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable for you.
Leviticus 22-21 And when anyone <f>ⓑ</f>offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock, to be accepted it must be perfect; there shall be no blemish in it.
Leviticus 22-22 Animals <f>ⓓ</f>blind or disabled or mutilated or having a discharge or <f>ⓔ</f>an itch or scabs you shall not offer to the LORD or give them to the LORD as a food <f>ⓕ</f>offering on the altar.
Leviticus 22-23 You may present a bull or a lamb that has a part <f>ⓖ</f>too long or too short for a freewill offering, but for a vow offering it cannot be accepted.
Leviticus 22-24 Any animal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut you shall not offer to the LORD; you shall not do it within your land,
Leviticus 22-25 neither shall you offer as <f>ⓗ</f>the bread of your God any such animals gotten from a foreigner. Since there is a <f>ⓘ</f>blemish in them, because of their mutilation, they will not be accepted for you.”
Leviticus 22-26 <pb/>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
Leviticus 22-27 <f>ⓙ</f> “When an ox or sheep or goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be acceptable as a food offering to the LORD.
Leviticus 22-28 But you shall not kill an ox or a sheep <f>ⓚ</f>and her young in one day.
Leviticus 22-29 And when you sacrifice a <f>ⓛ</f>sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.
Leviticus 22-30 It shall be eaten on the same day; <f>ⓜ</f>you shall leave none of it until morning: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22-31 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> “So you shall keep my commandments and do them: I am the LORD.
Leviticus 22-32 <f>ⓞ</f> And you shall not profane my holy name, that <f>ⓟ</f>I may be sanctified among the people of Israel. <f>ⓠ</f>I am the LORD who sanctifies you,
Leviticus 22-33 who brought you out of the land of Egypt <f>ⓡ</f>to be your God: I am the LORD.”

Ezekiel 40-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In the twenty-fifth year <f>ⓑ</f>of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, <f>ⓒ</f>in the fourteenth year after the city was struck down, on that very day, <f>ⓓ</f>the hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me to the city. <f>[1]</f>
Ezekiel 40-2 In <f>ⓔ</f>visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on <f>ⓕ</f>a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south.
Ezekiel 40-3 When he brought me there, behold, there was <f>ⓖ</f>a man whose appearance was <f>ⓗ</f>like bronze, with <f>ⓘ</f>a linen cord and <f>ⓙ</f>a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway.
Ezekiel 40-4 And the man said to me, <f>ⓚ</f>“Son of man, <f>ⓛ</f>look with your eyes, and <f>ⓜ</f>hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. <f>ⓝ</f>Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.”
Ezekiel 40-5 <pb/>And behold, there was <f>ⓞ</f>a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man's hand was six long cubits, <f>ⓟ</f>each being a cubit and a handbreadth <f>[2]</f> in length. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.
Ezekiel 40-6 Then he went into <f>ⓠ</f>the gateway facing east, <f>ⓡ</f>going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep. <f>[3]</f>
Ezekiel 40-7 And <f>ⓢ</f>the side rooms, one reed long and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed.
Ezekiel 40-8 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, on the inside, one reed.
Ezekiel 40-9 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; <f>ⓣ</f>and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end.
Ezekiel 40-10 And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate. <f>ⓤ</f>The three were of the same size, and the jambs on either side were of the same size.
Ezekiel 40-11 Then he measured the width of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the length of the gateway, thirteen cubits.
Ezekiel 40-12 There was a barrier before the side rooms, one cubit on either side. And the side rooms were six cubits on either side.
Ezekiel 40-13 Then he measured the gate from the ceiling of the one side room to the ceiling of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits; the openings faced each other.
Ezekiel 40-14 He measured also <f>ⓥ</f>the vestibule, sixty cubits. And around the vestibule of the gateway was the court. <f>[4]</f>
Ezekiel 40-15 From the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel 40-16 And the gateway had <f>ⓦ</f>windows all around, narrowing inwards toward the side rooms and toward their <f>ⓧ</f>jambs, and likewise the vestibule had windows all around inside, and on the jambs were <f>ⓨ</f>palm trees.
Ezekiel 40-17 <pb/>Then he brought me into <f>ⓩ</f>the outer court. And behold, there were <f>ⓐ</f>chambers and a <f>ⓑ</f>pavement, all around the court. <f>ⓒ</f>Thirty chambers faced the pavement.
Ezekiel 40-18 And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates. This was the lower pavement.
Ezekiel 40-19 Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, <f>[5]</f> a hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side. <f>[6]</f>
Ezekiel 40-20 <pb/>As for <f>ⓓ</f>the gate that faced toward the north, belonging to <f>ⓔ</f>the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth.

Ezekiel 40-24 <pb/>And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south. And <f>ⓞ</f>he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others.
Ezekiel 40-25 Both it and its vestibule <f>ⓟ</f>had windows all around, like the windows of the others. Its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.

Ezekiel 40-38 <pb/>There was <f>ⓓ</f>a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, <f>[9]</f> <f>ⓔ</f>where the burnt offering was to be washed.
Ezekiel 40-39 And in the vestibule of the gate were two <f>ⓕ</f>tables on either side, on which the <f>ⓖ</f>burnt offering and the <f>ⓗ</f>sin offering and the <f>ⓘ</f>guilt offering were to be slaughtered.
Ezekiel 40-40 And off to the side, on the outside as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and off to the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables.
Ezekiel 40-41 <f>ⓙ</f> Four tables were on either side of the gate, eight tables, <f>ⓚ</f>on which to slaughter.
Ezekiel 40-42 And there were four tables <f>ⓛ</f>of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the <f>ⓜ</f>burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered.
Ezekiel 40-43 And hooks, <f>[10]</f> a handbreadth long, were fastened all around within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid.
Ezekiel 40-44 <pb/>On the outside of the inner gateway there were two <f>ⓝ</f>chambers <f>[11]</f> in the <f>ⓞ</f>inner court, one <f>[12]</f> at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south <f>[13]</f> gate facing north.

Ezekiel 40-46 and the chamber that faces north is for the priests <f>ⓠ</f>who have charge of the altar. These are <f>ⓡ</f>the sons of Zadok, who alone <f>[14]</f> among the sons of Levi may come <f>ⓢ</f>near to the LORD to minister to him.”
Ezekiel 40-47 And he measured the court, <f>ⓣ</f>a hundred cubits long and <f>ⓤ</f>a hundred cubits broad, a square. And <f>ⓥ</f>the altar was in front of the temple.
