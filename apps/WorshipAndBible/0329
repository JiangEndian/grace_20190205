Genesis 33-1 <pb/>And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, <f>ⓐ</f>Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants.
Genesis 33-2 And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.
Genesis 33-3 He himself went on before them, <f>ⓑ</f>bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Genesis 33-4 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him <f>ⓓ</f>and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
Genesis 33-5 And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob said, <f>ⓔ</f>“The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
Genesis 33-6 Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down.
Genesis 33-7 Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.
Genesis 33-8 Esau said, “What do you mean by <f>ⓕ</f>all this company <f>[1]</f> that I met?” Jacob answered, <f>ⓖ</f>“To find favor in the sight of my lord.”
Genesis 33-9 But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”
Genesis 33-10 Jacob said, “No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. <f>ⓗ</f>For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me.
Genesis 33-11 Please accept my <f>ⓘ</f>blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” Thus he <f>ⓙ</f>urged him, and he took it.
Genesis 33-12 <pb/>Then Esau said, “Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of <f>[2]</f> you.”
Genesis 33-13 But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die.
Genesis 33-14 Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord <f>ⓚ</f>in Seir.”
Genesis 33-15 <pb/>So Esau said, “Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “What need is there? <f>ⓛ</f>Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
Genesis 33-16 So Esau returned that day on his way to <f>ⓜ</f>Seir.
Genesis 33-17 But Jacob journeyed to <f>ⓝ</f>Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. <f>[3]</f>
Genesis 33-18 <pb/>And Jacob came safely <f>[4]</f> to the city of <f>ⓞ</f>Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city.
Genesis 33-19 And from the sons of <f>ⓟ</f>Hamor, Shechem's father, <f>ⓠ</f>he bought for a hundred pieces of money <f>[5]</f> the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent.
Genesis 33-20 There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel. <f>[6]</f>
2 Chronicles 31-1 <pb/>Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and <f>ⓐ</f>broke in pieces the <f>ⓑ</f>pillars and cut down <f>ⓒ</f>the Asherim and broke down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the people of Israel returned to their cities, every man to his possession.
2 Chronicles 31-2 <pb/>And Hezekiah appointed <f>ⓓ</f>the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, division by division, each according to his service, the priests and the Levites, <f>ⓔ</f>for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to minister in the gates of the camp of the LORD and to give thanks and praise.
2 Chronicles 31-3 <f>ⓕ</f> The contribution of the king from his own possessions was for the burnt offerings: the burnt offerings of morning and evening, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the appointed feasts, <f>ⓖ</f>as it is written in the Law of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 31-4 And he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give <f>ⓗ</f>the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the Law of the LORD.
2 Chronicles 31-5 As soon as the command was spread abroad, the people of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field. And they brought in abundantly <f>ⓘ</f>the tithe of everything.
2 Chronicles 31-6 And the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and <f>ⓙ</f>the tithe of the dedicated things that had been dedicated to the LORD their God, and laid them in heaps.
2 Chronicles 31-7 In the third month they began to pile up the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles 31-8 When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles 31-9 And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.
2 Chronicles 31-10 Azariah the chief priest, who was <f>ⓚ</f>of the house of Zadok, answered him, “Since they began to bring the contributions into the house of the LORD, we have eaten and had enough and have plenty left, <f>ⓛ</f>for the LORD has blessed his people, so that we have this large amount left.”
2 Chronicles 31-11 <pb/>Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare <f>ⓜ</f>chambers in the house of the LORD, and they prepared them.
2 Chronicles 31-12 And they faithfully brought in the contributions, the tithes, and the dedicated things. The chief officer <f>ⓝ</f>in charge of them was Conaniah the Levite, with <f>ⓞ</f>Shimei his brother as second,
2 Chronicles 31-13 <f>ⓟ</f> while Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, <f>ⓠ</f>Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers assisting Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and <f>ⓡ</f>Azariah the chief officer of the house of God.
2 Chronicles 31-14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contribution reserved for the LORD and the most holy offerings.
2 Chronicles 31-15 <f>ⓢ</f> Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah were faithfully assisting him in <f>ⓣ</f>the cities of the priests, to distribute the portions to their brothers, old and young alike, by divisions,
2 Chronicles 31-16 except those enrolled by genealogy, males from three years old and upward — all who entered the house of the LORD <f>ⓤ</f>as the duty of each day required — for their service according to their offices, by their divisions.
2 Chronicles 31-17 The enrollment of the priests was according to their fathers' houses; that of the Levites <f>ⓥ</f>from twenty years old and upward was according to their offices, by their divisions.
2 Chronicles 31-18 They were enrolled with all their little children, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, the whole assembly, for they were faithful in keeping themselves holy.
2 Chronicles 31-19 And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of common land belonging to their cities, there were men in the several cities who were <f>ⓦ</f>designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone among the Levites who was enrolled.
2 Chronicles 31-20 <pb/>Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, <f>ⓧ</f>and he did what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God.
2 Chronicles 31-21 And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandments, seeking his God, he did with all his heart, and prospered.
Jeremiah 18-1 <pb/>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
Jeremiah 18-2 “Arise, and go down to <f>ⓐ</f>the potter's house, and there I will let you hear <f>[1]</f> my words.”
Jeremiah 18-3 So I went down to <f>ⓑ</f>the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel.
Jeremiah 18-4 And the vessel he was making of clay was <f>ⓒ</f>spoiled in the potter's hand, and <f>ⓓ</f>he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do.
Jeremiah 18-5 <pb/>Then the word of the LORD came to me:
Jeremiah 18-6 “O house of Israel, <f>ⓔ</f>can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. <f>ⓕ</f>Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
Jeremiah 18-7 If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will <f>ⓖ</f>pluck up and break down and destroy it,
Jeremiah 18-8 and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, <f>ⓗ</f>turns from its evil, <f>ⓘ</f>I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it.
Jeremiah 18-9 And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will <f>ⓙ</f>build and plant it,
Jeremiah 18-10 and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it.
Jeremiah 18-11 Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the LORD, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. <f>ⓚ</f>Return, every one from his evil way, and <f>ⓛ</f>amend your ways and your deeds.’
Jeremiah 18-12 <pb/>“But they say, <f>ⓜ</f>‘That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to <f>ⓝ</f>the stubbornness of his evil heart.’
Jeremiah 18-13 <pb/><t>“Therefore thus says the LORD: </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Ask among the nations, </t><t>Who has heard the like of this? </t><t>The virgin Israel </t><t>has done <f>ⓟ</f>a very horrible thing.</t>
Jeremiah 18-14 <t>Does the snow of Lebanon leave </t><t>the crags of Sirion? <f>[2]</f> </t><t>Do the mountain waters run dry, <f>[3]</f> </t><t>the cold flowing streams?</t>
Jeremiah 18-15 <t><f>ⓠ</f> But my people have forgotten me; </t><t>they make offerings to <f>ⓡ</f>false gods; </t><t>they made them stumble in their ways, </t><t><f>ⓢ</f>in the ancient roads, </t><t>and to walk into side roads, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>not the highway,</t>
Jeremiah 18-16 <t>making their land <f>ⓤ</f>a horror, </t><t>a thing <f>ⓥ</f>to be hissed at forever. </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>Everyone who passes by it is horrified </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>and shakes his head.</t>
Jeremiah 18-17 <t><f>ⓨ</f> Like the east wind <f>ⓩ</f>I will scatter them </t><t>before the enemy. </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>I will show them my back, not my face, </t><t>in the day of their calamity.” </t>
Jeremiah 18-18 <pb/>Then they said, <f>ⓑ</f>“Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, <f>ⓒ</f>for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. <f>ⓓ</f>Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.”
Jeremiah 18-19 <pb/><t>Hear me, O LORD, </t><t>and <f>ⓔ</f>listen to the voice of my adversaries.</t>
Jeremiah 18-20 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Should good be repaid with evil? </t><t>Yet <f>ⓖ</f>they have dug a pit for my life. </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>Remember how I stood before you </t><t>to speak good for them, </t><t>to turn away your wrath from them.</t>
Jeremiah 18-21 <t>Therefore <f>ⓘ</f>deliver up their children to famine; </t><t>give them over to the power of the sword; </t><t>let their wives become childless <f>ⓙ</f>and widowed. </t><t>May their men meet death by pestilence, </t><t>their youths be struck down by the sword in battle.</t>
Jeremiah 18-22 <t><f>ⓚ</f> May a cry be heard from their houses, </t><t>when you bring the plunderer suddenly upon them! </t><t>For <f>ⓛ</f>they have dug a pit to take me </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>and laid snares for my feet.</t>
Jeremiah 18-23 <t>Yet <f>ⓝ</f>you, O LORD, know </t><t>all their plotting to kill me. </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Forgive not their iniquity, </t><t>nor blot out their sin from your sight. </t><t>Let them be overthrown before you; </t><t>deal with them in the time of your anger. </t>
2 Timothy 4-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, <f>ⓑ</f>who is to judge the living and the dead, and by <f>ⓒ</f>his appearing and his kingdom:
2 Timothy 4-2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; <f>ⓓ</f>reprove, rebuke, and <f>ⓔ</f>exhort, with complete patience and teaching.
2 Timothy 4-3 <f>ⓕ</f> For the time is coming when people will not endure <f>ⓖ</f>sound <f>[1]</f> teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions,
2 Timothy 4-4 and <f>ⓗ</f>will turn away from listening to the truth and <f>ⓘ</f>wander off into myths.
2 Timothy 4-5 As for you, <f>ⓙ</f>always be sober-minded, <f>ⓚ</f>endure suffering, do the work of <f>ⓛ</f>an evangelist, <f>ⓜ</f>fulfill your ministry.
2 Timothy 4-6 <pb/>For <f>ⓝ</f>I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my <f>ⓞ</f>departure has come.
2 Timothy 4-7 <f>ⓟ</f> I have fought the good fight, <f>ⓠ</f>I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
2 Timothy 4-8 Henceforth there is <f>ⓡ</f>laid up for me <f>ⓢ</f>the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, <f>ⓣ</f>the righteous judge, will award to me on <f>ⓤ</f>that day, and not only to me but also to all <f>ⓥ</f>who have loved his appearing.
2 Timothy 4-9 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> Do your best to come to me soon.
2 Timothy 4-10 For <f>ⓧ</f>Demas, <f>ⓨ</f>in love with <f>ⓩ</f>this present world, <f>ⓐ</f>has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>Titus to Dalmatia.
2 Timothy 4-11 <f>ⓒ</f> Luke alone is with me. Get <f>ⓓ</f>Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry.
2 Timothy 4-12 <f>ⓔ</f> Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy 4-13 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.
2 Timothy 4-14 <f>ⓕ</f> Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; <f>ⓖ</f>the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
2 Timothy 4-15 Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message.
2 Timothy 4-16 At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. <f>ⓗ</f>May it not be charged against them!
2 Timothy 4-17 But <f>ⓘ</f>the Lord stood by me and <f>ⓙ</f>strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and <f>ⓚ</f>all the Gentiles might hear it. So <f>ⓛ</f>I was rescued <f>ⓜ</f>from the lion's mouth.
2 Timothy 4-18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. <f>ⓝ</f>To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy 4-19 <pb/>Greet <f>ⓞ</f>Prisca and Aquila, and <f>ⓟ</f>the household of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy 4-20 Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left <f>ⓠ</f>Trophimus, who was ill, at Miletus.
2 Timothy 4-21 <f>ⓡ</f> Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers. <f>[3]</f>
2 Timothy 4-22 <pb/>The Lord be <f>ⓢ</f>with your spirit. <f>ⓣ</f>Grace be with you. <f>[4]</f>
