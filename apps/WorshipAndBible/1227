15-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah.
15-2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
15-3 And he walked in all the sins that his father did before him, and <f>ⓑ</f>his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
15-4 Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him <f>ⓒ</f>a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem,
15-5 because <f>ⓓ</f>David did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, <f>ⓔ</f>except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
15-6 <f>ⓕ</f> Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
15-7 <f>ⓖ</f> The rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? <f>ⓗ</f>And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
15-8 <f>ⓘ</f> And Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place.
15-9 <pb/>In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah,
15-10 and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
15-11 <f>ⓙ</f> And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as David his father had done.
15-12 He put away the <f>ⓚ</f>male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed <f>ⓛ</f>all the idols that his fathers had made.
15-13 <f>ⓜ</f> He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her image and <f>ⓝ</f>burned it at the brook Kidron.
15-14 <f>ⓞ</f> But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless, <f>ⓟ</f>the heart of Asa was wholly true to the LORD all his days.
15-15 And <f>ⓠ</f>he brought into the house of the LORD the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels.
15-16 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
15-17 <f>ⓢ</f> Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and <f>ⓣ</f>built Ramah, <f>ⓤ</f>that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
15-18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold <f>ⓥ</f>that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house and gave them into the hands of his servants. <f>ⓦ</f>And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, <f>ⓧ</f>who lived in Damascus, saying,
15-19 “Let there be <f>ⓨ</f>a covenant <f>[1]</f> between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.”
15-20 And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel and conquered <f>ⓩ</f>Ijon, <f>ⓐ</f>Dan, <f>ⓑ</f>Abel-beth-maacah, and all <f>ⓒ</f>Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
15-21 And when Baasha heard of it, <f>ⓓ</f>he stopped building Ramah, and he lived in <f>ⓔ</f>Tirzah.
15-22 Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them King Asa built <f>ⓕ</f>Geba of Benjamin and <f>ⓖ</f>Mizpah.
15-23 <f>ⓗ</f> Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet.
15-24 And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and <f>ⓘ</f>Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.
15-25 <pb/><f>ⓙ</f> Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
15-26 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD <f>ⓚ</f>and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin <f>ⓛ</f>which he made Israel to sin.
15-27 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha struck him down at <f>ⓝ</f>Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
15-28 So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place.
15-29 And as soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He left to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, <f>ⓞ</f>according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite.
15-30 It was for the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned and <f>ⓟ</f>that he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel.
15-31 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
15-32 <f>ⓠ</f> And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
15-33 <pb/>In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years.
15-34 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD <f>ⓡ</f>and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel to sin.
12-1 <pb/>Remember also your Creator in <f>ⓐ</f>the days of your youth, before <f>ⓑ</f>the evil days come and the years draw near of which <f>ⓒ</f>you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;
12-2 before <f>ⓓ</f>the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain,
12-3 in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and <f>ⓔ</f>those who look through the windows are dimmed,
12-4 and <f>ⓕ</f>the doors on the street are shut — when <f>ⓖ</f>the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all <f>ⓗ</f>the daughters of song are brought low —
12-5 they are afraid also of what is high, and <f>ⓘ</f>terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, <f>[1]</f> and desire fails, because man is going to his <f>ⓙ</f>eternal <f>ⓚ</f>home, and the <f>ⓛ</f>mourners go about the streets —
12-6 before the silver cord is snapped, or <f>ⓜ</f>the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is <f>ⓝ</f>shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,
12-7 and <f>ⓞ</f>the dust returns to the earth as it was, and <f>ⓟ</f>the spirit returns to God <f>ⓠ</f>who gave it.
12-8 <f>ⓡ</f> Vanity <f>[2]</f> of vanities, says <f>ⓢ</f>the Preacher; all is vanity.
12-9 <pb/>Besides being wise, <f>ⓣ</f>the Preacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging <f>ⓤ</f>many proverbs with great care.
12-10 <f>ⓥ</f> The Preacher sought to find words of delight, and uprightly he wrote words of truth.
12-11 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> The words of the wise are like goads, and like <f>ⓧ</f>nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; they are <f>ⓨ</f>given by <f>ⓩ</f>one Shepherd.
12-12 My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making <f>ⓐ</f>many books there is no end, and <f>ⓑ</f>much study is a weariness of the flesh.
12-13 <pb/>The end of the matter; all has been heard. <f>ⓒ</f>Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. <f>[3]</f>
12-14 For <f>ⓓ</f>God will bring every deed into judgment, with <f>[4]</f> every secret thing, whether good or evil.
18-1 <pb/>After this Paul <f>[1]</f> left Athens and went to Corinth.
18-2 And he found a Jew named <f>ⓐ</f>Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife <f>ⓑ</f>Priscilla, because <f>ⓒ</f>Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them,
18-3 and <f>ⓓ</f>because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.
18-4 And <f>ⓔ</f>he reasoned in the synagogue <f>ⓕ</f>every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.
18-5 <pb/><f>ⓖ</f> When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul <f>ⓗ</f>was occupied with the word, <f>ⓘ</f>testifying to the Jews that the Christ was <f>ⓙ</f>Jesus.
18-6 And when they opposed and reviled him, <f>ⓚ</f>he shook out his garments and said to them, <f>ⓛ</f>“Your blood be on your own heads! <f>ⓜ</f>I am innocent. <f>ⓝ</f>From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”
18-7 And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius <f>ⓞ</f>Justus, <f>ⓟ</f>a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue.
18-8 <f>ⓠ</f> Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together <f>ⓡ</f>with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized.
18-9 And the Lord said to Paul <f>ⓢ</f>one night in <f>ⓣ</f>a vision, <J> <f>ⓤ</f>“Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,</J>
18-10 <J><f>ⓥ</f> for I am with you, and <f>ⓦ</f>no one will attack you to harm you, for <f>ⓧ</f>I have many in this city who are my people.”</J>
18-11 And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
18-12 <pb/>But when Gallio was <f>ⓨ</f>proconsul of Achaia, <f>ⓩ</f>the Jews <f>[2]</f> made a united attack on Paul and <f>ⓐ</f>brought him before the tribunal,
18-13 saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to <f>ⓑ</f>the law.”
18-14 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious <f>ⓒ</f>crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint.
18-15 But <f>ⓓ</f>since it is a matter of questions about words and names and <f>ⓔ</f>your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things.”
18-16 And he drove them from the tribunal.
18-17 And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.
18-18 <pb/>After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of <f>ⓕ</f>the brothers <f>[3]</f> and set sail for Syria, and with him <f>ⓖ</f>Priscilla and Aquila. At <f>ⓗ</f>Cenchreae <f>ⓘ</f>he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow.
18-19 And they came to <f>ⓙ</f>Ephesus, and he left them there, but <f>ⓚ</f>he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
18-20 When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined.
18-21 But on taking leave of them he said, “I will return to you <f>ⓛ</f>if God wills,” and he set sail from Ephesus.
18-22 <pb/>When he had landed at Caesarea, he <f>ⓜ</f>went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.
18-23 After spending some time there, he departed and <f>ⓝ</f>went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, <f>ⓞ</f>strengthening all the disciples.
18-24 <pb/>Now a Jew named <f>ⓟ</f>Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, <f>ⓠ</f>competent in the Scriptures.
18-25 He had been instructed in <f>ⓡ</f>the way of the Lord. And <f>ⓢ</f>being fervent in spirit, <f>[4]</f> he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only <f>ⓣ</f>the baptism of John.
18-26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when <f>ⓤ</f>Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him <f>ⓥ</f>the way of God more accurately.
18-27 And when he wished to cross to <f>ⓦ</f>Achaia, <f>ⓧ</f>the brothers encouraged him and <f>ⓨ</f>wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, <f>ⓩ</f>he greatly helped those who through grace had believed,
18-28 for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures <f>ⓐ</f>that the Christ was Jesus.
