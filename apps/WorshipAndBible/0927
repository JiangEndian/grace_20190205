Judges 4-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud died.
Judges 4-2 And the LORD <f>ⓑ</f>sold them into the hand of <f>ⓒ</f>Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in <f>ⓓ</f>Hazor. The commander of his army was <f>ⓔ</f>Sisera, who lived in <f>ⓕ</f>Harosheth-hagoyim.
Judges 4-3 Then the people of Israel <f>ⓖ</f>cried out to the LORD for help, for he had <f>ⓗ</f>900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.
Judges 4-4 <pb/>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
Judges 4-5 She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in <f>ⓘ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment.
Judges 4-6 She sent and summoned <f>ⓙ</f>Barak the son of Abinoam from <f>ⓚ</f>Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, “Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you, ‘Go, gather your men at Mount <f>ⓛ</f>Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun.
Judges 4-7 And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by <f>ⓜ</f>the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, <f>ⓝ</f>and I will give him into your hand’?”
Judges 4-8 Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”
Judges 4-9 And she said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will <f>ⓞ</f>sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Judges 4-10 And Barak called out <f>ⓟ</f>Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.
Judges 4-11 <pb/>Now Heber <f>ⓠ</f>the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of <f>ⓡ</f>Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in <f>ⓢ</f>Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.
Judges 4-12 <pb/>When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
Judges 4-13 Sisera called out all his chariots, <f>ⓣ</f>900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon.
Judges 4-14 And Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For this is the day in which <f>ⓤ</f>the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. <f>ⓥ</f>Does not the LORD go out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him.
Judges 4-15 <f>ⓦ</f> And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot.
Judges 4-16 And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.
Judges 4-17 <pb/>But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Judges 4-18 And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid.” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
Judges 4-19 And he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened <f>ⓧ</f>a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.
Judges 4-20 And he said to her, “Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, ‘Is anyone here?’ say, ‘No.’”
Judges 4-21 But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died.
Judges 4-22 And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.
Judges 4-23 <pb/><f>ⓨ</f> So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel.
Judges 4-24 And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

Matthew 16-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and <f>ⓑ</f>to test him <f>ⓒ</f>they asked him to show them <f>ⓓ</f>a sign from heaven.
Matthew 16-2 He answered them, <f>[1]</f> <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’</J>
Matthew 16-3 <J>And in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ <f>ⓕ</f>You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret <f>ⓖ</f>the signs of the times.</J>
Matthew 16-4 <J><f>ⓗ</f> An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.”</J> So <f>ⓘ</f>he left them and departed.
Matthew 16-5 <pb/>When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread.
Matthew 16-6 Jesus said to them, <J>“Watch and <f>ⓙ</f>beware of <f>ⓚ</f>the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</J>
Matthew 16-7 And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”
Matthew 16-8 But <f>ⓛ</f>Jesus, aware of this, said, <J> <f>ⓜ</f>“O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?</J>
Matthew 16-9 <J><f>ⓝ</f> Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember <f>ⓞ</f>the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</J>
Matthew 16-10 <J>Or <f>ⓟ</f>the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</J>
Matthew 16-11 <J>How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? <f>ⓠ</f>Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</J>
Matthew 16-12 <f>ⓡ</f> Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of <f>ⓢ</f>the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew 16-13 <pb/><f>ⓣ</f> Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, <J>“Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”</J>
Matthew 16-14 And they said, “Some say <f>ⓤ</f>John the Baptist, others say <f>ⓥ</f>Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
Matthew 16-15 He said to them, <J>“But who do you say that I am?”</J>
Matthew 16-16 Simon Peter replied, <f>ⓦ</f>“You are <f>ⓧ</f>the Christ, <f>ⓨ</f>the Son of <f>ⓩ</f>the living God.”
Matthew 16-17 And Jesus answered him, <J> <f>ⓐ</f>“Blessed are you, <f>ⓑ</f>Simon Bar-Jonah! For <f>ⓒ</f>flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, <f>ⓓ</f>but my Father who is in heaven.</J>
Matthew 16-18 <J>And I tell you, <f>ⓔ</f>you are Peter, and <f>ⓕ</f>on this rock <f>[2]</f> I will build my church, and <f>ⓖ</f>the gates of <f>ⓗ</f>hell <f>[3]</f> shall not prevail against it.</J>
Matthew 16-19 <J>I will give you <f>ⓘ</f>the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and <f>ⓙ</f>whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed <f>[4]</f> in heaven.”</J>
Matthew 16-20 <f>ⓚ</f> Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.
Matthew 16-21 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that <f>ⓜ</f>he must go to Jerusalem and <f>ⓝ</f>suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on <f>ⓞ</f>the third day be raised.
Matthew 16-22 And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! <f>[5]</f> This shall never happen to you.”
Matthew 16-23 But he turned and said to Peter, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Get behind me, Satan! You are <f>ⓠ</f>a hindrance <f>[6]</f> to me. For you <f>ⓡ</f>are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”</J>
Matthew 16-24 <pb/>Then Jesus told his disciples, <J>“If anyone would come after me, let him <f>ⓢ</f>deny himself and <f>ⓣ</f>take up his cross and follow me.</J>
Matthew 16-25 <J>For <f>ⓤ</f>whoever would save his life <f>[7]</f> will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</J>
Matthew 16-26 <J>For <f>ⓥ</f>what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or <f>ⓦ</f>what shall a man give in return for his soul?</J>
Matthew 16-27 <J><f>ⓧ</f> For the Son of Man is going to come with <f>ⓨ</f>his angels in the glory of his Father, and <f>ⓩ</f>then he will repay each person according to what he has done.</J>
Matthew 16-28 <J>Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not <f>ⓐ</f>taste death <f>ⓑ</f>until they see the Son of Man <f>ⓒ</f>coming in his kingdom.”</J>
