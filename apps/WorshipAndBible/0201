4-4 and <f>ⓕ</f>Penuel fathered <f>ⓖ</f>Gedor, and Ezer fathered Hushah. These were the sons of Hur, the firstborn of <f>ⓗ</f>Ephrathah, the father of Bethlehem.
4-5 <f>ⓘ</f> Ashhur, the father of Tekoa, had two wives, Helah and Naarah;

4-8 Koz fathered Anub, Zobebah, and the clans of Aharhel, the son of Harum.
4-9 Jabez was <f>ⓙ</f>more honorable than his brothers; and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, “Because I bore him in pain.” <f>[2]</f>
4-10 Jabez called upon the God of Israel, saying, “Oh that you would bless me and enlarge my border, and that your hand might be with me, and that you would keep me from harm <f>[3]</f> so that it might not bring me pain!” And God granted what he asked.
4-11 Chelub, the brother of Shuhah, fathered Mehir, who fathered Eshton.

4-18 And his Judahite wife bore <f>ⓝ</f>Jered the father of Gedor, Heber the father of Soco, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.
4-19 The sons of the wife of Hodiah, the sister of Naham, were the fathers of Keilah the Garmite and Eshtemoa the Maacathite.

4-22 and Jokim, and the men of Cozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who ruled in Moab and returned to Lehem <f>[9]</f> (now the records <f>[10]</f> are ancient).
4-23 These were the potters who were inhabitants of Netaim and Gederah. They lived there in the king's service.
4-24 <pb/><f>ⓟ</f> The sons of Simeon: Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, Shaul;
4-25 Shallum was his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son.
4-26 The sons of Mishma: Hammuel his son, Zaccur his son, Shimei his son.
4-27 Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brothers did not have many children, <f>ⓠ</f>nor did all their clan multiply <f>ⓡ</f>like the men of Judah.
4-28 <f>ⓢ</f> They lived in Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual,
4-29 <f>ⓣ</f> Bilhah, Ezem, <f>ⓤ</f>Tolad,
4-30 <f>ⓥ</f> Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,
4-31 Beth-marcaboth, <f>ⓦ</f>Hazar-susim, <f>ⓧ</f>Beth-biri, and <f>ⓨ</f>Shaaraim. These were their cities until David reigned.
4-32 And their villages were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan, five cities,
4-33 along with all their villages that were around these cities as far as <f>ⓩ</f>Baal. These were their settlements, and they kept a genealogical record.
4-34 <pb/>Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah the son of Amaziah,
4-35 Joel, Jehu the son of Joshibiah, son of Seraiah, son of Asiel,

4-37 Ziza the son of Shiphi, son of Allon, son of Jedaiah, son of Shimri, son of Shemaiah —
4-38 these mentioned by name were princes in their clans, <f>ⓐ</f>and their fathers' houses increased greatly.
4-39 They journeyed to the entrance of <f>ⓑ</f>Gedor, to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks,
4-40 where they found rich, good pasture, and the land was very broad, <f>ⓒ</f>quiet, and peaceful, for the former inhabitants there belonged to Ham.
4-41 <f>ⓓ</f> These, registered by name, came in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, and destroyed their tents and the Meunites who were found there, and marked them for destruction to this day, <f>ⓔ</f>and settled in their place, because there was pasture there for their flocks.
4-42 And some of them, five hundred men of the Simeonites, went to <f>ⓕ</f>Mount Seir, having as their leaders Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.
4-43 And they defeated <f>ⓖ</f>the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped, and they have lived there to this day.
28-1 <pb/><t>Ah, the proud crown of <f>ⓐ</f>the drunkards of Ephraim, </t><t>and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, </t><t>which is on the head of the rich valley of those overcome with wine!</t>
28-2 <t>Behold, the Lord has <f>ⓑ</f>one who is mighty and strong; </t><t>like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, </t><t>like <f>ⓒ</f>a storm of mighty, overflowing waters, </t><t>he casts down to the earth with his hand.</t>
28-3 <t><f>ⓓ</f> The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim </t><t>will be trodden underfoot;</t>
28-4 <t><f>ⓔ</f> and the fading flower of its glorious beauty, </t><t>which is on the head of the rich valley, </t><t>will be like <f>ⓕ</f>a first-ripe fig <f>[1]</f> before the summer: </t><t>when someone sees it, he swallows it </t><t>as soon as it is in his hand. </t>
28-5 <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f> In that day the LORD of hosts will be a crown of glory, <f>[2]</f> </t><t>and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people,</t>
28-6 <t>and <f>ⓗ</f>a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. </t>
28-7 <pb/><t><f>ⓙ</f> These also reel with wine </t><t>and <f>ⓚ</f>stagger with strong drink; </t><t>the priest and <f>ⓛ</f>the prophet reel with strong drink, </t><t>they are swallowed by <f>[3]</f> wine, </t><t>they stagger with strong drink, </t><t>they reel in vision, </t><t>they stumble in giving judgment.</t>
28-8 <t>For all tables are full of filthy vomit, </t><t>with no space left. </t>
28-9 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> “To whom will he teach knowledge, </t><t>and to whom will he explain the message? </t><t>Those who are weaned from the milk, </t><t>those taken from the breast?</t>
28-10 <t>For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, </t><t>line upon line, line upon line, </t><t>here a little, there a little.” </t>
28-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓝ</f> For by people of strange lips </t><t>and with a foreign tongue </t><t>the LORD will speak to this people,</t>
28-12 <t>to whom he has said, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>“This is rest; </t><t>give rest to the weary; </t><t>and this is repose”; </t><t>yet they would not hear.</t>
28-13 <t>And the word of the LORD will be to them </t><t>precept upon precept, precept upon precept, </t><t>line upon line, line upon line, </t><t>here a little, there a little, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>that they may go, and fall backward, </t><t>and be broken, and snared, and taken. </t>
28-14 <pb/><t>Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you <f>ⓠ</f>scoffers, </t><t>who rule this people in Jerusalem!</t>
28-15 <t>Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death, </t><t>and with Sheol we have an agreement, </t><t>when the <f>ⓡ</f>overwhelming whip passes through </t><t>it will not come to us, </t><t>for we have made <f>ⓢ</f>lies our refuge, </t><t>and in falsehood we have taken shelter”;</t>
28-16 <t>therefore thus says the Lord GOD, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>“Behold, I am the one who has laid <f>[4]</f> as a foundation <f>ⓤ</f>in Zion, </t><t>a stone, a tested stone, </t><t>a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation: </t><t>‘Whoever believes will not be in haste.’</t>
28-17 <t>And I will make justice <f>ⓥ</f>the line, </t><t>and righteousness <f>ⓦ</f>the plumb line; </t><t>and hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, </t><t>and waters will overwhelm the shelter.”</t>
28-18 <t>Then <f>ⓧ</f>your covenant with death will be annulled, </t><t>and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; </t><t>when the overwhelming scourge passes through, </t><t>you will be beaten down by it.</t>
28-19 <t>As often as it passes through it will take you; </t><t><f>ⓨ</f>for morning by morning it will pass through, </t><t>by day and by night; </t><t>and it will be <f>ⓩ</f>sheer terror to understand the message.</t>
28-20 <t>For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on, </t><t>and the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in.</t>
28-21 <t>For the LORD will rise up <f>ⓐ</f>as on Mount Perazim; </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>as in the Valley of <f>ⓒ</f>Gibeon he will be roused; </t><t>to do his deed — strange is his deed! </t><t>and to work his work — alien is his work!</t>
28-22 <t>Now therefore do not <f>ⓓ</f>scoff, </t><t>lest your bonds be made strong; </t><t>for I have heard <f>ⓔ</f>a decree of destruction </t><t>from the Lord GOD of hosts against the whole land. </t>
28-23 <pb/><t>Give ear, and hear my voice; </t><t>give attention, and hear my speech.</t>
28-24 <t>Does he who plows for sowing plow continually? </t><t>Does he continually open and harrow his ground?</t>
28-25 <t><f>ⓕ</f> When he has leveled its surface, </t><t>does he not scatter dill, sow cumin, </t><t>and put in wheat in rows </t><t>and barley in its proper place, </t><t>and emmer <f>[5]</f> as the border?</t>
28-26 <t><f>ⓖ</f> For he is rightly instructed; </t><t>his God teaches him. </t>
28-27 <pb/><t>Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, </t><t>nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin, </t><t>but dill is beaten out with a stick, </t><t>and cumin with a rod.</t>
28-28 <t>Does one crush grain for bread? </t><t>No, he does not thresh it forever; <f>[6]</f> </t><t>when he drives his cart wheel over it </t><t>with his horses, he does not crush it.</t>
28-29 <t>This also comes from the LORD of hosts; </t><t>he is <f>ⓗ</f>wonderful in counsel </t><t>and excellent in wisdom. </t>
10-1 <pb/>For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, <f>[1]</f> that our fathers were all under <f>ⓐ</f>the cloud, and all <f>ⓑ</f>passed through the sea,
10-2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
10-3 and <f>ⓒ</f>all ate the same <f>ⓓ</f>spiritual food,
10-4 and <f>ⓔ</f>all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.
10-5 Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for <f>ⓕ</f>they were overthrown <f>[2]</f> in the wilderness.
10-6 <pb/>Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as <f>ⓖ</f>they did.
10-7 <f>ⓗ</f> Do not be idolaters <f>ⓘ</f>as some of them were; as it is written, <f>ⓙ</f>“The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.”
10-8 <f>ⓚ</f> We must not indulge in sexual immorality <f>ⓛ</f>as some of them did, and <f>ⓜ</f>twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
10-9 We must not put Christ <f>[3]</f> to the test, <f>ⓝ</f>as some of them did and <f>ⓞ</f>were destroyed by serpents,
10-10 nor grumble, <f>ⓟ</f>as some of them did and <f>ⓠ</f>were destroyed by <f>ⓡ</f>the Destroyer.
10-11 Now these things happened to them as an example, but <f>ⓢ</f>they were written down for our instruction, <f>ⓣ</f>on whom the end of the ages has come.
10-12 Therefore <f>ⓤ</f>let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.
10-13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. <f>ⓥ</f>God is faithful, and <f>ⓦ</f>he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
10-14 <pb/>Therefore, my beloved, <f>ⓧ</f>flee from idolatry.
10-15 I speak <f>ⓨ</f>as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
10-16 <f>ⓩ</f> The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? <f>ⓐ</f>The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?
10-17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are <f>ⓑ</f>one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
10-18 Consider <f>ⓒ</f>the people of Israel: <f>[4]</f> <f>ⓓ</f>are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
10-19 What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that <f>ⓔ</f>an idol is anything?
10-20 No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice <f>ⓕ</f>they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons.
10-21 <f>ⓖ</f> You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and <f>ⓗ</f>the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and <f>ⓘ</f>the table of demons.
10-22 <f>ⓙ</f> Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? <f>ⓚ</f>Are we stronger than he?
10-23 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> “All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up.
10-24 <f>ⓜ</f> Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
10-25 <f>ⓝ</f> Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
10-26 For <f>ⓞ</f>“the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.”
10-27 If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, <f>ⓟ</f>eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
10-28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience —
10-29 I do not mean <f>ⓠ</f>your conscience, but his. For <f>ⓡ</f>why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?
10-30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that <f>ⓢ</f>for which I give thanks?
10-31 <pb/>So, whether you eat or drink, or <f>ⓣ</f>whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
10-32 <f>ⓤ</f> Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to <f>ⓥ</f>the church of God,
10-33 just as <f>ⓦ</f>I try to please everyone in everything I do, <f>ⓧ</f>not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
