Numbers 32-1 <pb/>Now the people of Reuben and the people of Gad had a very great number of livestock. And they saw the land of <f>ⓐ</f>Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for livestock.
Numbers 32-2 So the people of Gad and the people of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the chiefs of the congregation,
Numbers 32-3 <f>ⓑ</f> “Ataroth, <f>ⓒ</f>Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, <f>ⓓ</f>Nebo, and Beon,
Numbers 32-4 the land <f>ⓔ</f>that the LORD struck down before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.”
Numbers 32-5 And they said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Do not take us across the Jordan.”
Numbers 32-6 <pb/>But Moses said to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to the war while you sit here?
Numbers 32-7 Why will you discourage the heart of the people of Israel from going over into the land that the LORD has given them?
Numbers 32-8 Your fathers did this, <f>ⓕ</f>when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
Numbers 32-9 For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the people of Israel from going into the land that the LORD had given them.
Numbers 32-10 <f>ⓖ</f> And the LORD's anger was kindled on that day, and he swore, saying,
Numbers 32-11 ‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, <f>ⓗ</f>from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to give <f>ⓘ</f>to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me,
Numbers 32-12 none except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the <f>ⓙ</f>Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for <f>ⓚ</f>they have wholly followed the LORD.’
Numbers 32-13 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them <f>ⓛ</f>wander in the wilderness forty years, until <f>ⓜ</f>all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was gone.
Numbers 32-14 And behold, you have risen in your fathers' place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel!
Numbers 32-15 For if you <f>ⓝ</f>turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all this people.”
Numbers 32-16 <pb/>Then they came near to him and said, <f>ⓞ</f>“We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,
Numbers 32-17 but <f>ⓟ</f>we will take up arms, ready to go before the people of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
Numbers 32-18 <f>ⓠ</f> We will not return to our homes until each of the people of Israel has gained his inheritance.
Numbers 32-19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, <f>ⓡ</f>because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east.”
Numbers 32-20 So <f>ⓢ</f>Moses said to them, “If you will do this, if you will take up arms to go before the LORD for the war,
Numbers 32-21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the LORD, until he has <f>ⓣ</f>driven out his enemies from before him
Numbers 32-22 and the land is subdued before the LORD; then after that you shall return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel, and <f>ⓤ</f>this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
Numbers 32-23 But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD, and <f>ⓥ</f>be sure your sin will find you out.
Numbers 32-24 <f>ⓦ</f> Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what you have promised.”
Numbers 32-25 And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben said to Moses, “Your servants will do as my lord commands.
Numbers 32-26 <f>ⓧ</f> Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead,
Numbers 32-27 <f>ⓨ</f> but your servants will pass over, every man who is <f>ⓩ</f>armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord orders.”
Numbers 32-28 <pb/>So <f>ⓐ</f>Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to <f>ⓑ</f>Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel.
Numbers 32-29 And Moses said to them, “If the people of Gad and the people of Reuben, every man who is armed to battle before the LORD, will pass with you over the Jordan and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.
Numbers 32-30 However, if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”
Numbers 32-31 And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben answered, “What the LORD has said to your servants, we will do.
Numbers 32-32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.”
Numbers 32-33 <pb/>And <f>ⓒ</f>Moses gave to them, to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land and its cities with their territories, the cities of the land throughout the country.
Numbers 32-34 And the people of Gad built <f>ⓓ</f>Dibon, <f>ⓔ</f>Ataroth, <f>ⓕ</f>Aroer,
Numbers 32-35 Atroth-shophan, <f>ⓖ</f>Jazer, Jogbehah,
Numbers 32-36 <f>ⓗ</f> Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran, <f>ⓘ</f>fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
Numbers 32-37 And the people of Reuben built <f>ⓙ</f>Heshbon, <f>ⓚ</f>Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
Numbers 32-38 <f>ⓛ</f> Nebo, and <f>ⓜ</f>Baal-meon (<f>ⓝ</f>their names were changed), and <f>ⓞ</f>Sibmah. And they gave other names to the cities that they built.
Numbers 32-39 And the sons of <f>ⓟ</f>Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
Numbers 32-40 And Moses <f>ⓠ</f>gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he settled in it.
Numbers 32-41 And <f>ⓡ</f>Jair the son of Manasseh went and captured their villages, and called them Havvoth-jair. <f>[1]</f>
Numbers 32-42 And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

Joel 3-4 <pb/>“What are you to me, <f>ⓔ</f>O Tyre and Sidon, and all <f>ⓕ</f>the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, <f>ⓖ</f>I will return your payment on your own head swiftly and speedily.
