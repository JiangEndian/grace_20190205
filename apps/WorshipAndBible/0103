22-1 <pb/>For three years Syria and Israel continued without war.
22-2 <f>ⓐ</f> But in the third year <f>ⓑ</f>Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
22-3 And the king of Israel said to his servants, “Do you know that <f>ⓒ</f>Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?”
22-4 And he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?” And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, <f>ⓓ</f>“I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
22-5 <pb/>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
22-6 Then the king of Israel <f>ⓔ</f>gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.”
22-7 But <f>ⓕ</f>Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?”
22-8 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil.” And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say so.”
22-9 Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.”
22-10 Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor <f>ⓖ</f>at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
22-11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself <f>ⓗ</f>horns of iron and said, “Thus says the LORD, ‘With these <f>ⓘ</f>you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.’”
22-12 And all the prophets prophesied so and said, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”
22-13 <pb/>And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, “Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably.”
22-14 But Micaiah said, <f>ⓙ</f>“As the LORD lives, <f>ⓚ</f>what the LORD says to me, that I will speak.”
22-15 And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?” And he answered him, “Go up and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”
22-16 But the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
22-17 And he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, <f>ⓛ</f>as sheep that have no shepherd. And the LORD said, ‘These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.’”
22-18 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, <f>ⓜ</f>“Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”
22-19 And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: <f>ⓝ</f>I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, <f>ⓞ</f>and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left;
22-20 and the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said one thing, and another said another.
22-21 Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, ‘I will entice him.’
22-22 And the LORD said to him, ‘By what means?’ And he said, ‘I will go out, and will be <f>ⓟ</f>a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.’
22-23 Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the LORD has declared disaster for you.”
22-24 <pb/>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near <f>ⓠ</f>and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?”
22-25 And Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day when you go <f>ⓡ</f>into an inner chamber to hide yourself.”
22-26 And the king of Israel said, “Seize Micaiah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son,
22-27 and say, ‘Thus says the king, <f>ⓢ</f>“Put this fellow in prison and feed him meager rations of bread and water, <f>ⓣ</f>until I come in peace.”’”
22-28 And Micaiah said, “If you return in peace, <f>ⓤ</f>the LORD has not spoken by me.” And he said, <f>ⓥ</f>“Hear, all you peoples!”
22-29 <pb/>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
22-30 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, <f>ⓦ</f>“I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes.” And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
22-31 Now the king of Syria had commanded <f>ⓧ</f>the thirty-two captains of his chariots, “Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.”
22-32 And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is surely the king of Israel.” So they turned to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out.
22-33 And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
22-34 But a certain man drew his bow at random <f>[1]</f> and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and carry me out of the battle, <f>ⓨ</f>for I am wounded.”
22-35 And the battle continued that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died. And the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
22-36 And about sunset a cry went through the army, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!”
22-37 <pb/>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria.
22-38 And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the prostitutes washed themselves in it, <f>ⓩ</f>according to the word of the LORD that he had spoken.
22-39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and <f>ⓐ</f>the ivory house that he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
22-40 So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
22-41 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Jehoshaphat the son of <f>ⓒ</f>Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
22-42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
22-43 <f>ⓓ</f> He walked in all the way of Asa his father. He did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD. Yet <f>ⓔ</f>the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places.
22-44 <f>ⓕ</f> Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
22-45 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written <f>ⓖ</f>in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
22-46 And from the land he exterminated the remnant <f>ⓗ</f>of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa.
22-47 <pb/><f>ⓘ</f> There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.
22-48 Jehoshaphat made <f>ⓙ</f>ships of Tarshish to go to <f>ⓚ</f>Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at <f>ⓛ</f>Ezion-geber.
22-49 Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships,” but Jehoshaphat was not willing.
22-50 <f>ⓜ</f> And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place.
22-51 <pb/>Ahaziah the son of Ahab <f>ⓝ</f>began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
22-52 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD <f>ⓞ</f>and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
22-53 <f>ⓟ</f> He served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger <f>ⓠ</f>in every way that his father had done.
7-1 <pb/><t>How beautiful are your feet in sandals, </t><t>O <f>ⓐ</f>noble daughter! </t><t>Your rounded thighs are like <f>ⓑ</f>jewels, </t><t>the work of <f>ⓒ</f>a master hand.</t>
7-2 <t>Your navel is a rounded bowl </t><t>that never lacks mixed wine. </t><t>Your belly is a heap of wheat, </t><t>encircled with <f>ⓓ</f>lilies.</t>
7-3 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Your two breasts are like two fawns, </t><t>twins of a gazelle.</t>
7-4 <t>Your <f>ⓕ</f>neck is like an ivory tower. </t><t>Your <f>ⓖ</f>eyes are pools in <f>ⓗ</f>Heshbon, </t><t>by the gate of Bath-rabbim. </t><t>Your nose is like a tower of <f>ⓘ</f>Lebanon, </t><t>which looks toward <f>ⓙ</f>Damascus.</t>
7-5 <t>Your head crowns you like <f>ⓚ</f>Carmel, </t><t>and your <f>ⓛ</f>flowing locks are like purple; </t><t>a king is held captive in the tresses. </t>
7-6 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> How beautiful and <f>ⓝ</f>pleasant you are, </t><t>O loved one, with all your delights! <f>[1]</f></t>
7-7 <t>Your stature is like a palm tree, </t><t>and your breasts are like its clusters.</t>
7-8 <t>I say I will climb the palm tree </t><t>and lay hold of its fruit. </t><t>Oh may your breasts be like <f>ⓞ</f>clusters of the vine, </t><t>and the scent of your breath like apples,</t>
7-9 <t>and your <f>ⓟ</f>mouth <f>[2]</f> like the best wine. <pb/><e>She</e> </pb> </t> <pb/><t>It goes down smoothly for my beloved, </t><t>gliding over lips and teeth. <f>[3]</f> </t>
7-10 <pb/><t><f>ⓠ</f> I am my beloved's, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>and his desire is for me. </t>
7-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓢ</f> Come, my beloved, </t><t>let us go out into the fields </t><t>and lodge in the villages; <f>[4]</f></t>
7-12 <t>let us go out early to the vineyards </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>and see whether the vines have budded, </t><t>whether <f>ⓤ</f>the grape blossoms have opened </t><t>and the pomegranates are in bloom. </t><t>There I will give you my love.</t>
7-13 <t><f>ⓥ</f> The mandrakes give forth fragrance, </t><t>and beside our doors are all choice fruits, </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>new as well as old, </t><t>which I have laid up for you, O my beloved. </t>
25-1 <pb/>Now three days after Festus had arrived in <f>ⓐ</f>the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
25-2 And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews <f>ⓑ</f>laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him,
25-3 asking as a favor against Paul <f>[1]</f> that he summon him to Jerusalem — because <f>ⓒ</f>they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.
25-4 Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly.
25-5 “So,” said he, “let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him.”
25-6 <pb/>After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on <f>ⓓ</f>the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.
25-7 When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him <f>ⓔ</f>that they could not prove.
25-8 Paul argued in his defense, “Neither <f>ⓕ</f>against <f>ⓖ</f>the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor <f>ⓗ</f>against Caesar have I committed any offense.”
25-9 But Festus, <f>ⓘ</f>wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?”
25-10 But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar's <f>ⓙ</f>tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourself know very well.
25-11 If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. <f>ⓚ</f>I appeal to Caesar.”
25-12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, “To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.”
25-13 <pb/>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.
25-14 And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, <f>ⓛ</f>“There is a man left prisoner by Felix,
25-15 and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case <f>ⓜ</f>against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.
25-16 <f>ⓝ</f> I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone <f>ⓞ</f>before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him.
25-17 <f>ⓟ</f> So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on <f>ⓠ</f>the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought.
25-18 When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed.
25-19 Rather they <f>ⓡ</f>had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about <f>ⓢ</f>a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.
25-20 Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I <f>ⓣ</f>asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them.
25-21 But <f>ⓤ</f>when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of <f>ⓥ</f>the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.”
25-22 Then <f>ⓦ</f>Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” said he, “you will hear him.”
25-23 <pb/>So on the next day <f>ⓧ</f>Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
25-24 And Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom <f>ⓨ</f>the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, <f>ⓩ</f>shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
25-25 But I found that <f>ⓐ</f>he had done nothing deserving death. And <f>ⓑ</f>as he himself appealed to <f>ⓒ</f>the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him.
25-26 But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write.
25-27 For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.”
