20-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> In those days <f>ⓑ</f>Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, <f>ⓒ</f>‘Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover.’”
20-2 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, saying,
20-3 “Now, O LORD, <f>ⓓ</f>please remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and <f>ⓔ</f>with a whole heart, <f>ⓕ</f>and have done what is good in your sight.” <f>ⓖ</f>And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
20-4 And before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him:
20-5 “Turn back, and say to Hezekiah <f>ⓗ</f>the leader of my people, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: <f>ⓘ</f>I have heard your prayer; <f>ⓙ</f>I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD,
20-6 and I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, <f>ⓚ</f>and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake.”
20-7 And Isaiah said, “Bring a cake of figs. And let them take and lay it on the boil, that he may recover.”
20-8 <pb/>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD on the third day?”
20-9 And Isaiah said, “This shall be <f>ⓛ</f>the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has promised: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?”
20-10 And Hezekiah answered, “It is an easy thing for the shadow <f>ⓜ</f>to lengthen ten steps. Rather let the shadow go back ten steps.”
20-11 And Isaiah the prophet called to the LORD, <f>ⓝ</f>and he brought the shadow back ten steps, by which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz.
20-12 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> At that time <f>ⓟ</f>Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, <f>ⓠ</f>sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
20-13 And Hezekiah welcomed them, and he showed them <f>ⓡ</f>all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
20-14 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.”
20-15 He said, “What have they seen in your house?” And Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
20-16 <pb/>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the LORD:
20-17 Behold, the days are coming, when <f>ⓢ</f>all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the LORD.
20-18 <f>ⓣ</f> And some of your own sons, who will come from you, whom you will father, shall be taken away, <f>ⓤ</f>and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
20-19 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, <f>ⓥ</f>“The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Why not, if there will be peace and security in my days?”
20-20 <pb/><f>ⓦ</f> The rest of the deeds of Hezekiah and all his might and how he made <f>ⓧ</f>the pool and the conduit <f>ⓨ</f>and brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
20-21 <f>ⓩ</f> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
19-1 <pb/>An <f>ⓐ</f>oracle concerning <f>ⓑ</f>Egypt. <pb/><t>Behold, the LORD <f>ⓒ</f>is riding on a swift cloud </t><t>and comes to Egypt; </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence, </t><t>and the heart of the Egyptians will <f>ⓔ</f>melt within them.</t>
19-2 <t>And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>and they will fight, each against another </t><t>and each against his neighbor, </t><t>city against city, kingdom against kingdom;</t>
19-3 <t>and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out, </t><t>and I will confound <f>[1]</f> their <f>ⓖ</f>counsel; </t><t>and they will inquire of the idols and the sorcerers, </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>the mediums and the necromancers;</t>
19-4 <t>and I will give over the Egyptians </t><t>into the hand of <f>ⓘ</f>a hard master, </t><t>and a fierce king will rule over them, </t><t>declares the Lord GOD of hosts. </t>
19-5 <pb/><t>And the waters of the sea will be dried up, </t><t>and the river will be dry and parched,</t>
19-6 <t>and its canals will become foul, </t><t>and the branches of Egypt's Nile will diminish and dry up, </t><t>reeds and rushes will rot away.</t>
19-7 <t>There will be bare places by the Nile, </t><t>on the brink of the Nile, </t><t>and all that is sown by the Nile will be parched, </t><t>will be driven away, and will be no more.</t>
19-8 <t>The <f>ⓙ</f>fishermen will mourn and lament, </t><t>all who cast a hook in the Nile; </t><t>and they will languish </t><t>who spread nets on the water.</t>
19-9 <t>The workers in <f>ⓚ</f>combed flax will be in despair, </t><t>and the weavers of white cotton.</t>
19-10 <t>Those who are the <f>ⓛ</f>pillars of the land will be crushed, </t><t>and all who <f>ⓜ</f>work for pay will be grieved. </t>
19-11 <pb/><t>The princes of <f>ⓝ</f>Zoan are utterly foolish; </t><t>the wisest counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel. </t><t>How can you say to Pharaoh, </t><t>“I am a son of the wise, </t><t>a son of ancient kings”?</t>
19-12 <t>Where then are your <f>ⓞ</f>wise men? </t><t>Let them tell you </t><t>that they might know what the LORD of hosts has purposed against Egypt.</t>
19-13 <t>The princes of <f>ⓟ</f>Zoan have become fools, </t><t>and the princes of <f>ⓠ</f>Memphis are deluded; </t><t>those who are the <f>ⓡ</f>cornerstones of her tribes </t><t>have made Egypt stagger.</t>
19-14 <t>The LORD has mingled within her <f>ⓢ</f>a spirit of confusion, </t><t>and they will make Egypt stagger in all its deeds, </t><t><f>ⓣ</f>as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.</t>
19-15 <t>And there will be nothing for Egypt </t><t>that <f>ⓤ</f>head or tail, palm branch or reed, may do. </t>
19-16 <pb/>In that day the Egyptians will be <f>ⓥ</f>like women, and <f>ⓦ</f>tremble with fear before the hand that the LORD of hosts shakes over them.
19-17 And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians. Everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose that the LORD of hosts has purposed against them.
19-18 <pb/><f>ⓧ</f> In that day there will be <f>ⓨ</f>five cities in the land of Egypt that <f>ⓩ</f>speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts. One of these will be called the City of Destruction. <f>[2]</f>
19-19 <pb/>In that day there will be an <f>ⓐ</f>altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a <f>ⓑ</f>pillar to the LORD at its border.
19-20 <f>ⓒ</f> It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry to the LORD because of oppressors, <f>ⓓ</f>he will send them a savior and defender, and deliver them.
19-21 <f>ⓔ</f> And the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day <f>ⓕ</f>and worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows to the LORD and perform them.
19-22 <f>ⓖ</f> And the LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing, and they will return to the LORD, and he will listen to their pleas for mercy and heal them.
19-23 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, <f>ⓘ</f>and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
19-24 <pb/>In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, <f>ⓙ</f>a blessing in the midst of the earth,
19-25 whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, “Blessed be Egypt <f>ⓚ</f>my people, and Assyria <f>ⓛ</f>the work of my hands, and <f>ⓜ</f>Israel my inheritance.”
1-1 <pb/>Paul, <f>ⓐ</f>called <f>ⓑ</f>by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,
1-2 <pb/>To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those <f>ⓒ</f>sanctified in Christ Jesus, <f>ⓓ</f>called to be saints together with all those who in every place <f>ⓔ</f>call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:
1-3 <pb/><f>ⓕ</f> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1-4 <pb/>I <f>ⓖ</f>give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus,
1-5 that in every way <f>ⓗ</f>you were enriched in him in all <f>ⓘ</f>speech and all knowledge —
1-6 even as <f>ⓙ</f>the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you —
1-7 so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you <f>ⓚ</f>wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1-8 <f>ⓛ</f> who will sustain you to the end, <f>ⓜ</f>guiltless <f>ⓝ</f>in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1-9 <f>ⓞ</f> God is faithful, by whom you were called into the <f>ⓟ</f>fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
1-10 <pb/>I appeal to you, brothers, <f>[1]</f> by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no <f>ⓠ</f>divisions among you, but that you be united <f>ⓡ</f>in the same mind and the same judgment.
1-11 For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is <f>ⓢ</f>quarreling among you, my brothers.
1-12 What I mean is that <f>ⓣ</f>each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow <f>ⓤ</f>Apollos,” or “I follow <f>ⓥ</f>Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”
1-13 <f>ⓦ</f> Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you <f>ⓧ</f>baptized in the name of Paul?
1-14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except <f>ⓨ</f>Crispus and <f>ⓩ</f>Gaius,
1-15 so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name.
1-16 (I did baptize also <f>ⓐ</f>the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)
1-17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and <f>ⓑ</f>not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
1-18 <pb/>For the word of the cross is <f>ⓒ</f>folly to <f>ⓓ</f>those who are perishing, but to us <f>ⓔ</f>who are being saved it is <f>ⓕ</f>the power of God.
1-19 For it is written, <pb/><t><f>ⓖ</f>“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, </t><t>and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.” </t>
1-20 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? <f>ⓘ</f>Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
1-21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach <f>[2]</f> to save those who believe.
1-22 For <f>ⓙ</f>Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
1-23 but we preach Christ <f>ⓚ</f>crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,
1-24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ <f>ⓛ</f>the power of God and <f>ⓜ</f>the wisdom of God.
1-25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1-26 <pb/>For consider your calling, brothers: <f>ⓝ</f>not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, <f>[3]</f> not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
1-27 But <f>ⓞ</f>God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; <f>ⓟ</f>God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
1-28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even <f>ⓠ</f>things that are not, to <f>ⓡ</f>bring to nothing things that are,
1-29 so <f>ⓢ</f>that no human being <f>[4]</f> might boast in the presence of God.
1-30 And because of him <f>[5]</f> you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us <f>ⓣ</f>wisdom from God, <f>ⓤ</f>righteousness and <f>ⓥ</f>sanctification and <f>ⓦ</f>redemption,
1-31 so that, as it is written, <f>ⓧ</f>“Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
