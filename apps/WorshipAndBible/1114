27-1 <pb/>Then David said in his heart, “Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand.”
27-2 So David arose and went over, he and <f>ⓐ</f>the six hundred men who were with him, <f>ⓑ</f>to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
27-3 And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with <f>ⓒ</f>his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow.
27-4 And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought him.
27-5 <pb/>Then David said to Achish, “If <f>ⓓ</f>I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given me in one of the country towns, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?”
27-6 So that day Achish gave him <f>ⓔ</f>Ziklag. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
27-7 <f>ⓕ</f> And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.
27-8 <pb/>Now David <f>ⓖ</f>and his men went up and made raids against <f>ⓗ</f>the Geshurites, <f>ⓘ</f>the Girzites, and <f>ⓙ</f>the Amalekites, for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old, <f>ⓚ</f>as far as Shur, to the land of Egypt.
27-9 And David would strike the land and would leave neither man nor woman alive, but would take away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the garments, and come back to Achish.
27-10 When Achish asked, “Where have you <f>ⓛ</f>made a raid today?” David would say, “Against the Negeb of Judah,” or, “Against the Negeb of <f>ⓜ</f>the Jerahmeelites,” or, “Against the Negeb of <f>ⓝ</f>the Kenites.”
27-11 And David would leave neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath, thinking, “lest they should tell about us and say, ‘So David has done.’” Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines.
27-12 And Achish trusted David, thinking, “He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel; therefore he shall always be my servant.”
150-1 <pb/><t><f>ⓐ</f> Praise the LORD! </t><t>Praise God in his <f>ⓑ</f>sanctuary; </t><t>praise him in <f>ⓒ</f>his mighty heavens! <f>[1]</f></t>
150-2 <t>Praise him for his <f>ⓓ</f>mighty deeds; </t><t>praise him according to his excellent <f>ⓔ</f>greatness! </t>
150-3 <pb/><t>Praise him with <f>ⓕ</f>trumpet sound; </t><t>praise him with <f>ⓖ</f>lute and <f>ⓗ</f>harp!</t>
150-4 <t>Praise him with <f>ⓘ</f>tambourine and <f>ⓙ</f>dance; </t><t>praise him with <f>ⓚ</f>strings and <f>ⓛ</f>pipe!</t>
150-5 <t>Praise him with sounding <f>ⓜ</f>cymbals; </t><t>praise him with loud clashing cymbals!</t>
150-6 <t>Let <f>ⓝ</f>everything that has breath praise the LORD! </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>Praise the LORD! </t>
20-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> One day, <f>ⓑ</f>as Jesus <f>[1]</f> was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, <f>ⓒ</f>the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up
20-2 and said to him, “Tell us <f>ⓓ</f>by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority.”
20-3 He answered them, <J>“I also will ask you a question. Now tell me,</J>
20-4 <J>was the baptism of John <f>ⓔ</f>from heaven or from man?”</J>
20-5 And they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, <f>ⓕ</f>‘Why did you not believe him?’
20-6 But if we say, ‘From man,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was <f>ⓖ</f>a prophet.”
20-7 So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
20-8 And Jesus said to them, <J>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</J>
20-9 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> And he began to tell the people this parable: <J>“A man planted <f>ⓘ</f>a vineyard and <f>ⓙ</f>let it out to tenants and <f>ⓚ</f>went into another country for a long while.</J>
20-10 <J>When the time came, he sent a servant <f>[2]</f> to the tenants, so that <f>ⓛ</f>they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. <f>ⓜ</f>But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</J>
20-11 <J><f>ⓝ</f> And <f>ⓞ</f>he sent another servant. But they also beat and <f>ⓟ</f>treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.</J>
20-12 <J><f>ⓠ</f> And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out.</J>
20-13 <J>Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my <f>ⓡ</f>beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’</J>
20-14 <J>But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, <f>ⓢ</f>‘This is the heir. <f>ⓣ</f>Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.’</J>
20-15 <J>And they <f>ⓤ</f>threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</J>
20-16 <J><f>ⓥ</f> He will <f>ⓦ</f>come and destroy those tenants and <f>ⓧ</f>give the vineyard to others.”</J> When they heard this, they said, “Surely not!”
20-17 But he <f>ⓨ</f>looked directly at them and said, <J>“What then is this that is written:</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓩ</f>“‘The stone that the builders rejected</J> </t><t><J>has become the cornerstone’? <f>[3]</f></J> </t>
20-18 <pb/><J><f>ⓐ</f> Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls <f>ⓑ</f>on anyone, it will crush him.”</J>
20-19 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people.
20-20 <f>ⓓ</f> So they <f>ⓔ</f>watched him and sent spies, who <f>ⓕ</f>pretended to be sincere, that they might <f>ⓖ</f>catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of <f>ⓗ</f>the governor.
20-21 So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and <f>ⓘ</f>show no partiality, <f>[4]</f> but truly teach <f>ⓙ</f>the way of God.
20-22 Is it lawful for us to give <f>ⓚ</f>tribute to <f>ⓛ</f>Caesar, or not?”
20-23 But he perceived their <f>ⓜ</f>craftiness, and said to them,
20-24 <J>“Show me <f>ⓝ</f>a denarius. <f>[5]</f> Whose likeness and inscription does it have?”</J> They said, “Caesar's.”
20-25 He said to them, <J>“Then <f>ⓞ</f>render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</J>
20-26 And they were not able in the presence of the people <f>ⓟ</f>to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.
20-27 <pb/>There came to him <f>ⓠ</f>some Sadducees, <f>ⓡ</f>those who deny that there is a resurrection,
20-28 and they asked him a question, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us <f>ⓢ</f>that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man <f>[6]</f> must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.
20-29 Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children.
20-30 And the second
20-31 and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died.
20-32 Afterward the woman also died.
20-33 In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.”
20-34 <pb/>And Jesus said to them, <J> <f>ⓣ</f>“The sons of this age <f>ⓤ</f>marry and <f>ⓥ</f>are given in marriage,</J>
20-35 <J>but those who are <f>ⓦ</f>considered worthy to attain to <f>ⓧ</f>that age and to the resurrection from the dead <f>ⓨ</f>neither marry <f>ⓩ</f>nor are given in marriage,</J>
20-36 <J>for <f>ⓐ</f>they cannot die anymore, because they are <f>ⓑ</f>equal to angels and <f>ⓒ</f>are <f>ⓓ</f>sons of God, being <f>ⓔ</f>sons <f>[7]</f> of the resurrection.</J>
20-37 <J>But that the dead are raised, <f>ⓕ</f>even Moses showed, in <f>ⓖ</f>the passage about the bush, where he calls <f>ⓗ</f>the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</J>
20-38 <J>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all <f>ⓘ</f>live to him.”</J>
20-39 Then some of the scribes <f>ⓙ</f>answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”
20-40 For <f>ⓚ</f>they no longer dared to ask him any question.
20-41 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> But he said to them, <J>“How can they say that <f>ⓜ</f>the Christ is <f>ⓝ</f>David's son?</J>
20-42 <J>For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,</J> <pb/><t><J> <f>ⓞ</f>“‘The Lord said to my Lord,</J> </t><t><J>“Sit at my right hand,</J></t>
20-43 <t><J>until I make your enemies <f>ⓟ</f>your footstool.”’</J> </t>
20-44 <pb/><J>David thus calls him Lord, so <f>ⓠ</f>how is he his son?”</J>
20-45 <pb/><f>ⓡ</f> And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,
20-46 <J>“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and <f>ⓢ</f>the places of honor at feasts,</J>
20-47 <J><f>ⓣ</f> who devour widows' houses and <f>ⓤ</f>for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”</J>
