3-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into <f>ⓑ</f>the city of David until he had finished <f>ⓒ</f>building his own house <f>ⓓ</f>and the house of the LORD <f>ⓔ</f>and the wall around Jerusalem.
3-2 <f>ⓕ</f> The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD.
3-3 <pb/>Solomon <f>ⓖ</f>loved the LORD, <f>ⓗ</f>walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places.
3-4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, <f>ⓘ</f>for that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
3-5 <f>ⓙ</f> At Gibeon <f>ⓚ</f>the LORD appeared to Solomon <f>ⓛ</f>in a dream by night, and God said, “Ask what I shall give you.”
3-6 And Solomon said, “You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father, because <f>ⓜ</f>he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and <f>ⓝ</f>have given him a son to sit on his throne this day.
3-7 And now, O LORD my God, <f>ⓞ</f>you have made your servant king in place of David my father, <f>ⓟ</f>although I am but a little child. I do not know <f>ⓠ</f>how to go out or come in.
3-8 <f>ⓡ</f> And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, <f>ⓢ</f>too many to be numbered or counted for multitude.
3-9 <f>ⓣ</f> Give your servant therefore an understanding mind <f>ⓤ</f>to govern your people, that I may <f>ⓥ</f>discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?”
3-10 <pb/>It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this.
3-11 And God said to him, “Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right,
3-12 behold, <f>ⓦ</f>I now do according to your word. Behold, <f>ⓧ</f>I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.
3-13 <f>ⓨ</f> I give you also what you have not asked, <f>ⓩ</f>both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days.
3-14 And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, <f>ⓐ</f>as your father David walked, then <f>ⓑ</f>I will lengthen your days.”
3-15 <pb/>And Solomon <f>ⓒ</f>awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.
3-16 <pb/>Then two prostitutes came to the king <f>ⓓ</f>and stood before him.
3-17 The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.
3-18 Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. And we were alone. There was no one else with us in the house; only we two were in the house.
3-19 And this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on him.
3-20 And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me, while your servant slept, and laid him at her breast, and laid her dead son at my breast.
3-21 When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning, behold, he was not the child that I had borne.”
3-22 But the other woman said, “No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours.” The first said, “No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine.” Thus they spoke before the king.
3-23 <pb/>Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead’; and the other says, ‘No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.’”
3-24 And the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So a sword was brought before the king.
3-25 And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.”
3-26 Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, because <f>ⓔ</f>her heart yearned for her son, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means put him to death.” But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him.”
3-27 Then the king answered and said, “Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means put him to death; she is his mother.”
3-28 And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that <f>ⓕ</f>the wisdom of God was in him to do justice.
31-1 <pb/>The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:
31-2 <pb/><t>What are you doing, my son? <f>[1]</f> What are you doing, <f>ⓐ</f>son of my womb? </t><t>What are you doing, <f>ⓑ</f>son of my vows?</t>
31-3 <t>Do <f>ⓒ</f>not give your strength to women, </t><t>your ways to those <f>ⓓ</f>who destroy kings.</t>
31-4 <t><f>ⓔ</f> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, </t><t>it is not for kings <f>ⓕ</f>to drink wine, </t><t>or for rulers to take <f>ⓖ</f>strong drink,</t>
31-5 <t>lest they drink and forget what has been decreed </t><t>and <f>ⓗ</f>pervert the rights of all the afflicted.</t>
31-6 <t>Give strong drink to the one who <f>ⓘ</f>is perishing, </t><t>and wine to <f>ⓙ</f>those in bitter distress; <f>[2]</f></t>
31-7 <t><f>ⓚ</f> let them drink and forget their poverty </t><t>and remember their misery no more.</t>
31-8 <t><f>ⓛ</f> Open your mouth for the mute, </t><t>for the rights of all who are destitute. <f>[3]</f></t>
31-9 <t>Open your mouth, <f>ⓜ</f>judge righteously, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>defend the rights of <f>ⓞ</f>the poor and needy. </t>
31-10 <pb/><t><f>[4]</f> <f>ⓟ</f>An excellent wife who can find? </t><t>She is far more precious than <f>ⓠ</f>jewels.</t>
31-11 <t>The heart of her husband trusts in her, </t><t>and he will have no lack of gain.</t>
31-12 <t>She does him good, and not harm, </t><t>all the days of her life.</t>
31-13 <t>She <f>ⓡ</f>seeks wool and flax, </t><t>and works with willing hands.</t>
31-14 <t>She is like the ships of the merchant; </t><t>she brings her food from afar.</t>
31-15 <t>She <f>ⓢ</f>rises while it is yet night </t><t>and <f>ⓣ</f>provides food for her household </t><t>and portions for her maidens.</t>
31-16 <t>She considers a field and buys it; </t><t>with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</t>
31-17 <t>She <f>ⓤ</f>dresses herself <f>[5]</f> with strength </t><t>and makes her arms strong.</t>
31-18 <t>She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. </t><t>Her lamp does not go out at night.</t>
31-19 <t>She puts her hands to the distaff, </t><t>and her hands hold the spindle.</t>
31-20 <t>She <f>ⓥ</f>opens her hand to <f>ⓦ</f>the poor </t><t>and reaches out her hands to <f>ⓧ</f>the needy.</t>
31-21 <t>She is not afraid of snow for her household, </t><t>for all her household are clothed in <f>ⓨ</f>scarlet. <f>[6]</f></t>
31-22 <t>She makes <f>ⓩ</f>bed coverings for herself; </t><t>her clothing is <f>ⓐ</f>fine linen and <f>ⓑ</f>purple.</t>
31-23 <t>Her husband is known in <f>ⓒ</f>the gates </t><t>when he sits among the elders of the land.</t>
31-24 <t>She makes <f>ⓓ</f>linen garments and sells them; </t><t>she delivers sashes to the merchant.</t>
31-25 <t><f>ⓔ</f> Strength and dignity are her clothing, </t><t>and she laughs at the time to come.</t>
31-26 <t>She opens her mouth with wisdom, </t><t>and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.</t>
31-27 <t>She looks well to the ways of her household </t><t>and does not eat the bread of idleness.</t>
31-28 <t>Her children rise up and call her blessed; </t><t>her husband also, and he praises her:</t>
31-29 <t>“Many <f>ⓕ</f>women have done <f>ⓖ</f>excellently, </t><t>but you surpass them all.”</t>
31-30 <t><f>ⓗ</f> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, </t><t>but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</t>
31-31 <t>Give her of the fruit of her hands, </t><t>and let her works praise her in the gates. </t>
6-1 <pb/>Now in these days <f>ⓐ</f>when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists <f>[1]</f> arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in <f>ⓑ</f>the daily distribution.
6-2 And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, “It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.
6-3 <f>ⓒ</f> Therefore, brothers, <f>[2]</f> pick out from among you seven men <f>ⓓ</f>of good repute, <f>ⓔ</f>full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty.
6-4 But <f>ⓕ</f>we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”
6-5 And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, <f>ⓖ</f>a man full of faith and <f>ⓗ</f>of the Holy Spirit, and <f>ⓘ</f>Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, <f>ⓙ</f>a proselyte of Antioch.
6-6 These they set before the apostles, and <f>ⓚ</f>they prayed and <f>ⓛ</f>laid their hands on them.
6-7 <pb/>And <f>ⓜ</f>the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests <f>ⓝ</f>became obedient to <f>ⓞ</f>the faith.
6-8 <pb/>And Stephen, full of grace and <f>ⓟ</f>power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.
6-9 Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen.
6-10 But <f>ⓠ</f>they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.
6-11 Then <f>ⓡ</f>they secretly instigated men who said, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”
6-12 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council,
6-13 and they <f>ⓢ</f>set up false <f>ⓣ</f>witnesses who said, “This man never ceases to speak words against <f>ⓤ</f>this holy place and the law,
6-14 for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth <f>ⓥ</f>will destroy this place and will <f>ⓦ</f>change <f>ⓧ</f>the customs that Moses delivered to us.”
6-15 And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face <f>ⓨ</f>was like the face of an angel.
