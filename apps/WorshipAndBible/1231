19-1 <pb/>Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how <f>ⓐ</f>he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
19-2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, <f>ⓑ</f>“So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.”
19-3 Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to <f>ⓒ</f>Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.
19-4 <pb/>But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. <f>ⓓ</f>And he asked that he might die, saying, “It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”
19-5 And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, “Arise and eat.”
19-6 And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again.
19-7 And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, “Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.”
19-8 And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food <f>ⓔ</f>forty days and forty nights to <f>ⓕ</f>Horeb, the mount of God.
19-9 <pb/>There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, <f>ⓖ</f>the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
19-10 He said, “I have been very <f>ⓗ</f>jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, <f>ⓘ</f>thrown down your altars, and <f>ⓙ</f>killed your prophets with the sword, <f>ⓚ</f>and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.”
19-11 And he said, “Go out and <f>ⓛ</f>stand on the mount before the LORD.” And behold, the LORD passed by, and <f>ⓜ</f>a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind <f>ⓝ</f>an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
19-12 And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper. <f>[1]</f>
19-13 And when Elijah heard it, <f>ⓞ</f>he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, <f>ⓟ</f>there came a voice to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
19-14 He said, <f>ⓠ</f>“I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, <f>ⓡ</f>thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.”
19-15 And the LORD said to him, “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.
19-16 <f>ⓢ</f> And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and <f>ⓣ</f>Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.
19-17 And the one who escapes from <f>ⓤ</f>the sword of Hazael <f>ⓥ</f>shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu <f>ⓦ</f>shall Elisha put to death.
19-18 <f>ⓧ</f> Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not <f>ⓨ</f>kissed him.”
19-19 <pb/>So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast <f>ⓩ</f>his cloak upon him.
19-20 And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, <f>ⓐ</f>“Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?”
19-21 And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh <f>ⓑ</f>with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.
4-1 <pb/><t>Behold, <f>ⓐ</f>you are beautiful, my love, </t><t>behold, you are beautiful! </t><t><f>ⓑ</f>Your eyes are doves </t><t><f>ⓒ</f>behind your veil. </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>Your hair is like a flock of goats </t><t>leaping down <f>ⓔ</f>the slopes of Gilead.</t>

4-6 <t><f>ⓡ</f> Until the day breathes </t><t>and the shadows flee, </t><t>I will go away to the mountain of <f>ⓢ</f>myrrh </t><t>and the hill of <f>ⓣ</f>frankincense.</t>

4-9 <pb/><t>You have captivated my heart, my <f>ⓒ</f>sister, my bride; </t><t>you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, </t><t>with one <f>ⓓ</f>jewel of your necklace.</t>

22-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> “Brothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you.”
22-2 <pb/>And when they heard that he was addressing them in <f>ⓑ</f>the Hebrew language, <f>[1]</f> they became even more quiet. And he said:
22-3 <pb/><f>ⓒ</f> “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated <f>ⓓ</f>at the feet of <f>ⓔ</f>Gamaliel <f>[2]</f> <f>ⓕ</f>according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, <f>ⓖ</f>being zealous for God <f>ⓗ</f>as all of you are this day.
22-4 <f>ⓘ</f> I persecuted <f>ⓙ</f>this Way <f>ⓚ</f>to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,
22-5 as <f>ⓛ</f>the high priest and <f>ⓜ</f>the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to <f>ⓝ</f>the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.
22-6 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> “As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me.
22-7 And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <J>‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’</J>
22-8 And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, <J>‘I am <f>ⓟ</f>Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.’</J>
22-9 <f>ⓠ</f> Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand <f>[3]</f> the voice of the one who was speaking to me.
22-10 And I said, <f>ⓡ</f>‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, <J>‘Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.’</J>
22-11 And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.
22-12 <pb/>“And <f>ⓢ</f>one Ananias, a devout man <f>ⓣ</f>according to the law, <f>ⓤ</f>well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
22-13 <f>ⓥ</f> came to me, and standing by me said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.’ And <f>ⓦ</f>at that very hour I received my sight and saw him.
22-14 And he said, <f>ⓧ</f>‘The God of our fathers <f>ⓨ</f>appointed you to know his will, <f>ⓩ</f>to see <f>ⓐ</f>the Righteous One and <f>ⓑ</f>to hear a voice from his mouth;
22-15 for <f>ⓒ</f>you will be a witness for him to everyone of what <f>ⓓ</f>you have seen and heard.
22-16 And now why do you wait? <f>ⓔ</f>Rise and be baptized and <f>ⓕ</f>wash away your sins, <f>ⓖ</f>calling on his name.’
22-17 <pb/><f>ⓗ</f> “When I had returned to Jerusalem and <f>ⓘ</f>was praying in the temple, I fell into <f>ⓙ</f>a trance
22-18 and saw him saying to me, <J> <f>ⓚ</f>‘Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’</J>
22-19 And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another <f>ⓛ</f>I imprisoned and <f>ⓜ</f>beat those who believed in you.
22-20 And when the blood of Stephen <f>ⓝ</f>your witness was being shed, <f>ⓞ</f>I myself was standing by and <f>ⓟ</f>approving and <f>ⓠ</f>watching over the garments of those who killed him.’
22-21 And he said to me, <J>‘Go, for I will send you <f>ⓡ</f>far away to the Gentiles.’</J>”
22-22 <pb/>Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, <f>ⓢ</f>“Away with such a fellow from the earth! For <f>ⓣ</f>he should not be allowed to live.”
22-23 And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
22-24 the tribune ordered him to be brought into <f>ⓤ</f>the barracks, saying that he should be <f>ⓥ</f>examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.
22-25 But when they had stretched him out for the whips, <f>[4]</f> Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it lawful for you to flog <f>ⓦ</f>a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?”
22-26 When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.”
22-27 So the tribune came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.”
22-28 The tribune answered, “I bought this citizenship for a large sum.” Paul said, “But I am a citizen by birth.”
22-29 So those who were about <f>ⓧ</f>to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also <f>ⓨ</f>was afraid, <f>ⓩ</f>for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that <f>ⓐ</f>he had bound him.
22-30 <pb/>But on the next day, <f>ⓑ</f>desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.
