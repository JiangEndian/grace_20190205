Genesis 21-1 <pb/>The LORD <f>ⓐ</f>visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah <f>ⓑ</f>as he had promised.
Genesis 21-2 And Sarah <f>ⓒ</f>conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age <f>ⓓ</f>at the time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis 21-3 Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, <f>ⓔ</f>Isaac. <f>[1]</f>
Genesis 21-4 And Abraham <f>ⓕ</f>circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, <f>ⓖ</f>as God had commanded him.
Genesis 21-5 <f>ⓗ</f> Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis 21-6 And Sarah said, <f>ⓘ</f>“God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.”
Genesis 21-7 And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? <f>ⓙ</f>Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
Genesis 21-8 <pb/>And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis 21-9 But Sarah <f>ⓚ</f>saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, <f>ⓛ</f>laughing. <f>[2]</f>
Genesis 21-10 So she said to Abraham, <f>ⓜ</f>“Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.”
Genesis 21-11 And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
Genesis 21-12 But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for <f>ⓝ</f>through Isaac shall your offspring be named.
Genesis 21-13 And I will make <f>ⓞ</f>a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.”
Genesis 21-14 So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of <f>ⓟ</f>Beersheba.
Genesis 21-15 <pb/>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes.
Genesis 21-16 Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, “Let me not look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.
Genesis 21-17 And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
Genesis 21-18 Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”
Genesis 21-19 Then <f>ⓠ</f>God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
Genesis 21-20 And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness <f>ⓡ</f>and became an expert with the bow.
Genesis 21-21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
Genesis 21-22 <pb/>At that time <f>ⓢ</f>Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, <f>ⓣ</f>“God is with you in all that you do.
Genesis 21-23 Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but <f>ⓤ</f>as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.”
Genesis 21-24 And Abraham said, “I will swear.”
Genesis 21-25 <pb/>When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants <f>ⓥ</f>had seized,
Genesis 21-26 Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.”
Genesis 21-27 So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men <f>ⓦ</f>made a covenant.
Genesis 21-28 Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.
Genesis 21-29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?”
Genesis 21-30 He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this <f>[3]</f> may be a witness for me that I dug this well.”
Genesis 21-31 Therefore <f>ⓧ</f>that place was called Beersheba, <f>[4]</f> because there both of them swore an oath.
Genesis 21-32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
Genesis 21-33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and <f>ⓨ</f>called there on the name of the LORD, <f>ⓩ</f>the Everlasting God.
Genesis 21-34 And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.
2 Chronicles 19-1 <pb/>Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in safety to his house in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 19-2 But <f>ⓐ</f>Jehu the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Hanani <f>ⓒ</f>the seer went out to meet him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you <f>ⓓ</f>help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, <f>ⓔ</f>wrath has gone out against you from the LORD.
2 Chronicles 19-3 Nevertheless, <f>ⓕ</f>some good is found in you, for <f>ⓖ</f>you destroyed the Asheroth out of the land, and have <f>ⓗ</f>set your heart to seek God.”
2 Chronicles 19-4 <pb/>Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem. And he went out again among the people, from Beersheba to <f>ⓘ</f>the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 19-5 He appointed <f>ⓙ</f>judges in the land in all <f>ⓚ</f>the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
2 Chronicles 19-6 and said to the judges, “Consider what you do, <f>ⓛ</f>for you judge not for man but for the LORD. He is with you in giving judgment.
2 Chronicles 19-7 Now then, let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Be careful what you do, for <f>ⓜ</f>there is no injustice with the LORD our God, <f>ⓝ</f>or partiality or taking bribes.”
2 Chronicles 19-8 <pb/>Moreover, in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat <f>ⓞ</f>appointed certain Levites and priests and heads of families of Israel, <f>ⓟ</f>to give judgment for the LORD and to decide disputed cases. They had their seat at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 19-9 And he charged them: <f>ⓠ</f>“Thus you shall do in the fear of the LORD, in faithfulness, <f>ⓡ</f>and with your whole heart:
2 Chronicles 19-10 <f>ⓢ</f> whenever a case comes to you from your brothers who live in their cities, concerning bloodshed, law or commandment, statutes or rules, then you shall warn them, that they may not incur guilt before the LORD and <f>ⓣ</f>wrath may not come upon you and your brothers. Thus you shall do, and you will not incur guilt.
2 Chronicles 19-11 And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you <f>ⓤ</f>in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the governor of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters, and the Levites will serve you as officers. <f>ⓥ</f>Deal courageously, and may the LORD be with the upright!” <f>[1]</f>
Jeremiah 6-1 <pb/><t>Flee for safety, <f>ⓐ</f>O people of Benjamin, </t><t>from the midst of Jerusalem! </t><t>Blow the trumpet in <f>ⓑ</f>Tekoa, </t><t>and raise a signal on <f>ⓒ</f>Beth-haccherem, </t><t>for disaster looms <f>ⓓ</f>out of the north, </t><t>and great destruction.</t>

Jeremiah 6-6 <pb/><t>For thus says the LORD of hosts: </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>“Cut down her trees; </t><t><f>ⓚ</f>cast up a siege mound against Jerusalem. </t><t>This is the city that must be <f>ⓛ</f>punished; </t><t>there is nothing but oppression within her.</t>
Jeremiah 6-7 <t><f>ⓜ</f> As a well keeps its water fresh, </t><t>so she keeps fresh her evil; </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>violence and destruction are heard within her; </t><t>sickness and wounds are ever before me.</t>
Jeremiah 6-8 <t>Be warned, O Jerusalem, </t><t><f>ⓞ</f>lest I turn from you in disgust, </t><t>lest I make you <f>ⓟ</f>a desolation, </t><t>an uninhabited land.” </t>
Jeremiah 6-9 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD of hosts: </t><t><f>ⓠ</f>“They shall glean thoroughly as a vine </t><t>the remnant of Israel; </t><t>like a grape gatherer pass your hand again </t><t>over its branches.”</t>

Jeremiah 6-11 <t>Therefore I am full of the wrath of the LORD; </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>I am weary of holding it in. </t><t><f>ⓦ</f>“Pour it out upon the children in the street, </t><t>and upon the gatherings of young men, also; </t><t><f>ⓧ</f>both husband and wife <f>ⓨ</f>shall be taken, </t><t>the elderly and the very aged.</t>
Jeremiah 6-12 <t><f>ⓩ</f> Their houses shall be turned over to others, </t><t>their fields and wives together, </t><t>for I will stretch out my hand </t><t>against the inhabitants of the land,” <pb/>declares the LORD.</t>
Jeremiah 6-13 <t><f>ⓐ</f> “For from the least to the greatest of them, </t><t>everyone <f>ⓑ</f>is greedy for unjust gain; </t><t>and from <f>ⓒ</f>prophet to priest, </t><t>everyone deals falsely.</t>

Jeremiah 6-16 <pb/><t>Thus says the LORD: </t><t>“Stand by the roads, and look, </t><t>and ask for <f>ⓗ</f>the ancient paths, </t><t>where the good way is; and walk in it, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>and find rest for your souls. </t><t>But they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’</t>

Jeremiah 6-19 <t>Hear, O earth; behold, I am bringing disaster upon this people, </t><t><f>ⓜ</f>the fruit of their devices, </t><t>because they have not paid attention to my words; </t><t>and as for my law, they have rejected it.</t>

2 Thessalonians 1-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, <pb/>To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Thessalonians 1-2 <pb/>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians 1-3 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, <f>[1]</f> as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.
2 Thessalonians 1-4 Therefore <f>ⓒ</f>we ourselves boast about you <f>ⓓ</f>in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith <f>ⓔ</f>in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring.
2 Thessalonians 1-5 <pb/>This is <f>ⓕ</f>evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be <f>ⓖ</f>considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering —
2 Thessalonians 1-6 since indeed God considers it <f>ⓗ</f>just <f>ⓘ</f>to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
2 Thessalonians 1-7 and to grant <f>ⓙ</f>relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when <f>ⓚ</f>the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven <f>ⓛ</f>with his mighty angels
2 Thessalonians 1-8 <f>ⓜ</f> in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those <f>ⓝ</f>who do not know God and on those who <f>ⓞ</f>do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
2 Thessalonians 1-9 They will suffer the punishment of <f>ⓟ</f>eternal destruction, <f>ⓠ</f>away from <f>[2]</f> the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
2 Thessalonians 1-10 <f>ⓡ</f> when he comes on <f>ⓢ</f>that day <f>ⓣ</f>to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our <f>ⓤ</f>testimony to you <f>ⓥ</f>was believed.
2 Thessalonians 1-11 To this end we <f>ⓦ</f>always pray for you, that our God may <f>ⓧ</f>make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every <f>ⓨ</f>work of faith by his power,
2 Thessalonians 1-12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus <f>ⓩ</f>may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
