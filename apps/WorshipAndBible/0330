34-1 <pb/>Now <f>ⓐ</f>Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land.
34-2 And when Shechem the son of <f>ⓑ</f>Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her.
34-3 And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.
34-4 So Shechem <f>ⓒ</f>spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this girl for my wife.”
34-5 <pb/>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came.
34-6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
34-7 The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and <f>ⓓ</f>very angry, because he <f>ⓔ</f>had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, <f>ⓕ</f>for such a thing must not be done.
34-8 <pb/>But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your <f>[1]</f> daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife.
34-9 Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.
34-10 You shall dwell with us, and <f>ⓖ</f>the land shall be open to you. Dwell and <f>ⓗ</f>trade in it, and <f>ⓘ</f>get property in it.”
34-11 Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, <f>ⓙ</f>“Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.
34-12 Ask me for as great a <f>ⓚ</f>bride-price <f>[2]</f> and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.”
34-13 <pb/>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.
34-14 They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for <f>ⓛ</f>that would be a disgrace to us.
34-15 Only on this condition will we agree with you — that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised.
34-16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people.
34-17 But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.”
34-18 <pb/>Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.
34-19 And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now <f>ⓜ</f>he was the most honored of all his father's house.
34-20 So Hamor and his son Shechem <f>ⓝ</f>came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,
34-21 “These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and <f>ⓞ</f>trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters.
34-22 Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people — when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.
34-23 Will not their livestock, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us.”
34-24 And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who <f>ⓟ</f>went out of the gate of his city.
34-25 <pb/>On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, <f>ⓠ</f>Simeon and Levi, <f>ⓡ</f>Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males.
34-26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went away.
34-27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
34-28 They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.
34-29 All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered.
34-30 <pb/>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, <f>ⓢ</f>“You have brought trouble on me <f>ⓣ</f>by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, <f>ⓤ</f>the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <f>ⓥ</f>My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.”
34-31 But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”
32-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> After these things and these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah and encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them for himself.
32-2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to fight against Jerusalem,
32-3 he planned with his officers and his mighty men to stop the water of the springs that were outside the city; and they helped him.
32-4 A great many people were gathered, and they stopped all the springs and <f>ⓑ</f>the brook that flowed through the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?”
32-5 He set to work resolutely and built up <f>ⓒ</f>all the wall that was broken down and raised towers upon it, <f>[1]</f> and outside it he built another wall, and he strengthened the <f>ⓓ</f>Millo in the city of David. He also made weapons and shields in abundance.
32-6 And he set combat commanders over the people and gathered them together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke <f>ⓔ</f>encouragingly to them, saying,
32-7 <f>ⓕ</f> “Be strong and courageous. <f>ⓖ</f>Do not be afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him, <f>ⓗ</f>for there are more with us than with him.
32-8 With him is <f>ⓘ</f>an arm of flesh, <f>ⓙ</f>but with us is the LORD our God, to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people took confidence from the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
32-9 <pb/>After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria, who was besieging Lachish with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezekiah king of Judah and to all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,
32-10 “Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, ‘On what are you trusting, that you endure the siege in Jerusalem?
32-11 Is not Hezekiah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, “The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria”?
32-12 <f>ⓚ</f> Has not this same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, “Before one altar you shall worship, and on it you shall burn your sacrifices”?
32-13 Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
32-14 Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers devoted to destruction was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my hand?
32-15 Now, therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!’”
32-16 <pb/>And his servants said still more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.
32-17 And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the LORD, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, “Like the gods of the nations of the lands who have not delivered their people from my hands, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver his people from my hand.”
32-18 And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, in order that they might take the city.
32-19 And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.
32-20 <pb/>Then Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this and cried to heaven.
32-21 And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with <f>ⓛ</f>shame of face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god, some of his own sons struck him down there with the sword.
32-22 So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies, and he provided for them on every side.
32-23 And many <f>ⓜ</f>brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time onward.
32-24 <pb/><f>ⓝ</f> In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death, and he prayed to the LORD, and he answered him and gave him a sign.
32-25 But Hezekiah <f>ⓞ</f>did not make return according to the benefit done to him, for <f>ⓟ</f>his heart was proud. Therefore <f>ⓠ</f>wrath came upon him and Judah and Jerusalem.
32-26 But Hezekiah <f>ⓡ</f>humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
32-27 <pb/>And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of <f>ⓢ</f>costly vessels;
32-28 storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds.
32-29 He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great possessions.
32-30 This same Hezekiah <f>ⓣ</f>closed the upper outlet of the waters of <f>ⓤ</f>Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
32-31 And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, <f>ⓥ</f>who had been sent to him to inquire about <f>ⓦ</f>the sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, <f>ⓧ</f>in order to test him and to know all that was in his heart.
32-32 <pb/>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written <f>ⓨ</f>in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, <f>ⓩ</f>in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
32-33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the <f>ⓐ</f>upper part of the tombs of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
19-1 <pb/>Thus says the LORD, “Go, buy <f>ⓐ</f>a potter's earthenware <f>ⓑ</f>flask, and take some of <f>ⓒ</f>the elders of the people and some of <f>ⓓ</f>the elders of the priests,
19-2 and go out <f>ⓔ</f>to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the words that I tell you.
19-3 You shall say, <f>ⓕ</f>‘Hear the word of the LORD, <f>ⓖ</f>O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such disaster upon this place that <f>ⓗ</f>the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
19-4 <f>ⓘ</f> Because the people have forsaken me and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known; <f>ⓙ</f>and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
19-5 <f>ⓚ</f> and have built the high places of Baal <f>ⓛ</f>to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, <f>ⓜ</f>which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind —
19-6 therefore, <f>ⓝ</f>behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place shall no more be called Topheth, or <f>ⓞ</f>the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
19-7 And in this place <f>ⓟ</f>I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, <f>ⓠ</f>and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. <f>ⓡ</f>I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth.
19-8 And I will make this city <f>ⓢ</f>a horror, <f>ⓣ</f>a thing to be hissed at. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its wounds.
19-9 <f>ⓤ</f> And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and everyone shall eat the flesh of his neighbor <f>ⓥ</f>in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.’
19-10 <pb/>“Then <f>ⓦ</f>you shall break <f>ⓧ</f>the flask in the sight of the men who go with you,
19-11 and shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, <f>ⓨ</f>as one breaks a potter's vessel, <f>ⓩ</f>so that it can never be mended. <f>ⓐ</f>Men shall bury in Topheth because there will be no place else to bury.
19-12 Thus will I do to this place, declares the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city <f>ⓑ</f>like Topheth.
19-13 The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah — <f>ⓒ</f>all the houses on whose <f>ⓓ</f>roofs offerings have been offered <f>ⓔ</f>to all the host of heaven, and <f>ⓕ</f>drink offerings have been poured out to other gods — shall be defiled <f>ⓖ</f>like the place of Topheth.’”
19-14 <pb/>Then Jeremiah came from <f>ⓗ</f>Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, <f>ⓘ</f>and he stood in the court of the LORD's house and said to all the people:
19-15 “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, behold, I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, <f>ⓙ</f>because they have stiffened their neck, <f>ⓚ</f>refusing to hear my words.”
1-1 <pb/>Paul, a servant <f>[1]</f> of God and <f>ⓐ</f>an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and <f>ⓑ</f>their knowledge of the truth, <f>ⓒ</f>which accords with godliness,
1-2 <f>ⓓ</f> in hope of eternal life, which God, <f>ⓔ</f>who never lies, <f>ⓕ</f>promised <f>ⓖ</f>before the ages began <f>[2]</f>
1-3 and <f>ⓗ</f>at the proper time manifested in his word <f>[3]</f> <f>ⓘ</f>through the preaching <f>ⓙ</f>with which I have been entrusted <f>ⓚ</f>by the command of God our Savior;
1-4 <pb/>To Titus, <f>ⓛ</f>my true child in <f>ⓜ</f>a common faith: <pb/><f>ⓝ</f>Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
1-5 <pb/><f>ⓞ</f> This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and <f>ⓟ</f>appoint elders in every town as I directed you —
1-6 <f>ⓠ</f> if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, <f>[4]</f> and his children are believers <f>[5]</f> and not open to the charge of <f>ⓡ</f>debauchery or insubordination.
1-7 For an overseer, <f>[6]</f> <f>ⓢ</f>as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not <f>ⓣ</f>be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent <f>ⓤ</f>or greedy for gain,
1-8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, <f>ⓥ</f>and disciplined.
1-9 He must <f>ⓦ</f>hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in <f>ⓧ</f>sound <f>[7]</f> doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.
1-10 <pb/>For there are many who are insubordinate, <f>ⓨ</f>empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of <f>ⓩ</f>the circumcision party. <f>[8]</f>
1-11 They must be silenced, since <f>ⓐ</f>they are upsetting whole families by teaching <f>ⓑ</f>for shameful gain what they ought not to teach.
1-12 <f>ⓒ</f> One of the Cretans, <f>[9]</f> a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” <f>[10]</f>
1-13 This testimony is true. Therefore <f>ⓓ</f>rebuke them <f>ⓔ</f>sharply, that they <f>ⓕ</f>may be sound in the faith,
1-14 <f>ⓖ</f> not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and <f>ⓗ</f>the commands of people <f>ⓘ</f>who turn away from the truth.
1-15 <f>ⓙ</f> To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and <f>ⓚ</f>unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both <f>ⓛ</f>their minds and their consciences are defiled.
1-16 <f>ⓜ</f> They profess to know God, but they <f>ⓝ</f>deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, <f>ⓞ</f>unfit for any good work.
