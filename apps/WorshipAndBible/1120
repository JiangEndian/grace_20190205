2-1 <pb/>After this David <f>ⓐ</f>inquired of the LORD, “Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?” And the LORD said to him, “Go up.” David said, “To which shall I go up?” And he said, “To <f>ⓑ</f>Hebron.”
2-2 So David went up there, and <f>ⓒ</f>his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
2-3 And David brought up <f>ⓓ</f>his men who were with him, everyone with his household, and they lived in the towns of Hebron.
2-4 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David <f>ⓔ</f>king over the house of Judah. <pb/>When they told David, <f>ⓕ</f>“It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,”
2-5 David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, <f>ⓖ</f>“May you be blessed by the LORD, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him.
2-6 Now may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you. And I will do good to you because you have done this thing.
2-7 Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and <f>ⓗ</f>the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”
2-8 <pb/>But <f>ⓘ</f>Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to <f>ⓙ</f>Mahanaim,
2-9 and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel.
2-10 Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
2-11 <f>ⓚ</f> And the time that David was king in Hebron over <f>ⓛ</f>the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2-12 <pb/>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2-13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at <f>ⓜ</f>the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
2-14 And Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men arise and compete before us.” And Joab said, “Let them arise.”
2-15 Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
2-16 And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent's side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, <f>[1]</f> which is at Gibeon.
2-17 And the battle was very fierce that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.
2-18 <pb/>And the <f>ⓝ</f>three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was <f>ⓞ</f>as swift of foot as a wild gazelle.
2-19 And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
2-20 Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is it you, Asahel?” And he answered, “It is I.”
2-21 Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
2-22 And Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?”
2-23 But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him <f>ⓟ</f>in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.
2-24 <pb/>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
2-25 And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill.
2-26 Then Abner called to Joab, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?”
2-27 And Joab said, “As God lives, if <f>ⓠ</f>you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning.”
2-28 So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.
2-29 <pb/>And Abner and his men went all that night through <f>ⓡ</f>the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to <f>ⓢ</f>Mahanaim.
2-30 Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel.
2-31 But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner's men.
2-32 And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.
6-1 <pb/><t>My son, if you have put up <f>ⓐ</f>security for your neighbor, </t><t>have <f>ⓑ</f>given your pledge for a stranger,</t>

6-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> A little sleep, a little slumber, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>a little <f>ⓢ</f>folding of the hands to rest,</t>
6-11 <t><f>ⓣ</f> and poverty will come upon you like a robber, </t><t>and want like an armed man. </t>

6-15 <t>therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; </t><t><f>ⓐ</f>in a moment he will be broken <f>ⓑ</f>beyond healing. </t>
6-16 <pb/><t>There are <f>ⓒ</f>six things that the LORD hates, </t><t><f>ⓓ</f>seven that are an abomination to him:</t>
6-17 <t><f>ⓔ</f> haughty eyes, <f>ⓕ</f>a lying tongue, </t><t>and <f>ⓖ</f>hands that shed innocent blood,</t>
6-18 <t><f>ⓗ</f> a heart that devises wicked plans, </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>feet that make haste to run to evil,</t>
6-19 <t><f>ⓙ</f> a false witness who <f>ⓚ</f>breathes out lies, </t><t>and one who <f>ⓛ</f>sows discord among brothers. </t>
6-20 <pb/><t><f>ⓜ</f> My son, keep your father's commandment, </t><t><f>ⓝ</f>and forsake not your mother's teaching.</t>

6-22 <t><f>ⓠ</f> When you walk, they <f>[4]</f> will lead you; </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>when you lie down, they will <f>ⓢ</f>watch over you; </t><t>and when you awake, they will talk with you.</t>
6-23 <t>For the commandment is <f>ⓣ</f>a lamp and the teaching a light, </t><t>and the <f>ⓤ</f>reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</t>
6-24 <t>to preserve you from the evil woman, <f>[5]</f> </t><t>from the smooth tongue of <f>ⓥ</f>the adulteress. <f>[6]</f></t>
6-25 <t><f>ⓦ</f> Do not desire her beauty in your heart, </t><t>and do not let her capture you with her <f>ⓧ</f>eyelashes;</t>

6-27 <t>Can a man carry <f>ⓑ</f>fire next to his <f>ⓒ</f>chest </t><t>and his clothes not be burned?</t>

6-29 <t>So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; </t><t>none who touches her <f>ⓔ</f>will go unpunished.</t>
6-30 <t>People do not despise a thief if he steals </t><t>to <f>ⓕ</f>satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</t>

6-32 <t>He who commits adultery lacks sense; </t><t>he who does it destroys himself.</t>
6-33 <t>He will get wounds and dishonor, </t><t>and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</t>
6-34 <t>For <f>ⓘ</f>jealousy makes a man furious, </t><t>and he will not spare when <f>ⓙ</f>he takes revenge.</t>

2-1 <pb/>On <f>ⓐ</f>the third day there was a wedding at <f>ⓑ</f>Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
2-2 Jesus also was invited to the wedding with <f>ⓒ</f>his disciples.
2-3 When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.”
2-4 And Jesus said to her, <J> <f>ⓓ</f>“Woman, <f>ⓔ</f>what does this have to do with me? <f>ⓕ</f>My hour has not yet come.”</J>
2-5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
2-6 <pb/>Now there were six stone water jars there <f>ⓖ</f>for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty <f>ⓗ</f>gallons. <f>[1]</f>
2-7 Jesus said to the servants, <J>“Fill the jars with water.”</J> And they filled them up to the brim.
2-8 And he said to them, <J>“Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.”</J> So they took it.
2-9 When the master of the feast tasted <f>ⓘ</f>the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom
2-10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.”
2-11 This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested <f>ⓙ</f>his glory. And <f>ⓚ</f>his disciples believed in him.
2-12 <pb/>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and <f>ⓛ</f>his brothers <f>[2]</f> and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.
2-13 <pb/><f>ⓜ</f> The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus <f>ⓝ</f>went up to Jerusalem.
2-14 <f>ⓞ</f> In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.
2-15 And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.
2-16 And he told those who sold the pigeons, <J>“Take these things away; do not make <f>ⓟ</f>my Father's house a house of trade.”</J>
2-17 His disciples remembered that it was written, <f>ⓠ</f>“Zeal for your house will consume me.”
2-18 <pb/>So the Jews said to him, <f>ⓡ</f>“What sign do you show us for doing these things?”
2-19 Jesus answered them, <J> <f>ⓢ</f>“Destroy this temple, and in three days <f>ⓣ</f>I will raise it up.”</J>
2-20 The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, <f>[3]</f> and will you raise it up in three days?”
2-21 But he was speaking about <f>ⓤ</f>the temple of his body.
2-22 When therefore he was raised from the dead, <f>ⓥ</f>his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed <f>ⓦ</f>the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.
2-23 <pb/>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name <f>ⓧ</f>when they saw the signs that he was doing.
2-24 But Jesus <f>ⓨ</f>on his part did not entrust himself to them, because <f>ⓩ</f>he knew all people
2-25 and needed no one to bear witness about man, for <f>ⓐ</f>he himself knew what was in man.
