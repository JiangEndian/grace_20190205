16-1 <pb/>They <f>ⓐ</f>set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.
16-2 And the whole congregation of the people of Israel <f>ⓑ</f>grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,
16-3 and the people of Israel said to them, <f>ⓒ</f>“Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, <f>ⓓ</f>when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”
16-4 <pb/>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I am about to rain <f>ⓔ</f>bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may <f>ⓕ</f>test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.
16-5 On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, <f>ⓖ</f>it will be twice as much as they gather daily.”
16-6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, <f>ⓗ</f>“At evening <f>ⓘ</f>you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
16-7 and in the morning you shall see the <f>ⓙ</f>glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against the LORD. For <f>ⓚ</f>what are we, that you grumble against us?”
16-8 And Moses said, “When the LORD gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the LORD has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him — <f>ⓛ</f>what are we? Your grumbling is not <f>ⓜ</f>against us but against the LORD.”
16-9 <pb/>Then Moses <f>ⓝ</f>said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, <f>ⓞ</f>‘Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.’”
16-10 And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the <f>ⓟ</f>glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
16-11 And the LORD said to Moses,
16-12 “I <f>ⓠ</f>have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, ‘At <f>ⓡ</f>twilight you shall eat meat, and <f>ⓢ</f>in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’”
16-13 <pb/>In the evening <f>ⓣ</f>quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning <f>ⓤ</f>dew lay around the camp.
16-14 And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground.
16-15 When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, <f>ⓥ</f>“What is it?” <f>[1]</f> For they <f>ⓦ</f>did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, <f>ⓧ</f>“It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat.
16-16 This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an <f>ⓨ</f>omer, <f>[2]</f> according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.’”
16-17 And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less.
16-18 But when they measured it with an omer, <f>ⓩ</f>whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat.
16-19 And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it over till the morning.”
16-20 But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and <f>ⓐ</f>it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them.
16-21 Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.
16-22 <pb/>On <f>ⓑ</f>the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,
16-23 he said to them, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Tomorrow is a day of <f>ⓒ</f>solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.’”
16-24 So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and <f>ⓓ</f>it did not stink, and there were no worms in it.
16-25 Moses said, “Eat it today, for <f>ⓔ</f>today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field.
16-26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.”
16-27 <pb/>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.
16-28 And the LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓕ</f>“How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
16-29 See! The LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”
16-30 So the people <f>ⓖ</f>rested on the seventh day.
16-31 <pb/>Now the house of Israel called its name <f>ⓗ</f>manna. It was <f>ⓘ</f>like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
16-32 Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”
16-33 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a <f>ⓙ</f>jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.”
16-34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before <f>ⓚ</f>the testimony to be kept.
16-35 The people of Israel <f>ⓛ</f>ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till <f>ⓜ</f>they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
16-36 (An omer is <f>ⓝ</f>the tenth part of an ephah.) <f>[3]</f>
5-1 <pb/><f>ⓐ</f> On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in <f>ⓑ</f>the inner court of the king's palace, in front of the king's quarters, while the king was sitting on his royal throne inside the throne room opposite the entrance to the palace.
5-2 And when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, <f>ⓒ</f>she won favor in his sight, <f>ⓓ</f>and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
5-3 And the king said to her, “What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even <f>ⓔ</f>to the half of my kingdom.”
5-4 And Esther said, “If it please the king, <f>[1]</f> let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the king.”
5-5 Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has asked.” So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared.
5-6 <f>ⓕ</f> And as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king said to Esther, <f>ⓖ</f>“What is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? <f>ⓗ</f>Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.” <f>[2]</f>
5-7 Then Esther answered, “My wish and my request is:
5-8 <f>ⓘ</f> If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king <f>[3]</f> to grant my wish and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to <f>ⓙ</f>the feast that I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.”
5-9 <pb/>And Haman went out that day <f>ⓚ</f>joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai <f>ⓛ</f>in the king's gate, <f>ⓜ</f>that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
5-10 Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and brought his friends and <f>ⓝ</f>his wife Zeresh.
5-11 And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, <f>ⓞ</f>the number of his sons, all the promotions with which <f>ⓟ</f>the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king.
5-12 Then Haman said, “Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the feast she prepared. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.
5-13 Yet all this is worth nothing to me, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting <f>ⓠ</f>at the king's gate.”
5-14 Then <f>ⓡ</f>his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, <f>ⓢ</f>“Let a gallows <f>[4]</f> fifty cubits <f>[5]</f> high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it. Then go joyfully with the king to the feast.” This idea pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.

3-17 But <f>ⓘ</f>if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet <f>ⓙ</f>closes his heart against him, <f>ⓚ</f>how does God's love abide in him?
3-18 Little children, let us not <f>ⓛ</f>love in word or talk but in deed and <f>ⓜ</f>in truth.
3-19 <pb/>By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him;
3-20 for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything.
3-21 Beloved, <f>ⓝ</f>if our heart does not condemn us, <f>ⓞ</f>we have confidence before God;
3-22 and <f>ⓟ</f>whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and <f>ⓠ</f>do what pleases him.
3-23 And this is his commandment, <f>ⓡ</f>that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and <f>ⓢ</f>love one another, <f>ⓣ</f>just as he has commanded us.
3-24 <f>ⓤ</f> Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, <f>[4]</f> and God <f>[5]</f> in him. And <f>ⓥ</f>by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.
