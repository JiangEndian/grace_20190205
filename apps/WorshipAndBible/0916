17-1 <pb/>Then allotment was made to the people of Manasseh, for he was <f>ⓐ</f>the firstborn of Joseph. To <f>ⓑ</f>Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, <f>ⓒ</f>were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war.
17-2 And allotments were made <f>ⓓ</f>to the rest of the people of Manasseh by their clans, Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, by their clans.
17-3 <pb/>Now <f>ⓔ</f>Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters, and these are the names of his daughters: <f>ⓕ</f>Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
17-4 They approached <f>ⓖ</f>Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the leaders and said, <f>ⓗ</f>“The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance along with our brothers.” So according to the mouth of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.
17-5 Thus there fell to Manasseh ten portions, besides <f>ⓘ</f>the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan,
17-6 because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the people of Manasseh.
17-7 <pb/>The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to <f>ⓙ</f>Michmethath, which is east of Shechem. Then the boundary goes along southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
17-8 The land of <f>ⓚ</f>Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah on the boundary of Manasseh belonged to the people of Ephraim.
17-9 <f>ⓛ</f> Then the boundary went down to the brook Kanah. These cities, to the south of the brook, among the cities of Manasseh, belong to Ephraim. Then the boundary of Manasseh goes on the north side of the brook and ends at the sea,
17-10 the land to the south being Ephraim's and that to the north being Manasseh's, with the sea forming its boundary. On the north Asher is reached, and on the east Issachar.
17-11 Also in Issachar and in Asher <f>ⓜ</f>Manasseh had Beth-shean and its villages, and Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of <f>ⓝ</f>Dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of <f>ⓞ</f>Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of <f>ⓟ</f>Megiddo and its villages; <f>ⓠ</f>the third is Naphath. <f>[1]</f>
17-12 <f>ⓡ</f> Yet the people of Manasseh could not take possession of those cities, but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.
17-13 Now when the people of Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites <f>ⓢ</f>to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.
17-14 <pb/>Then <f>ⓣ</f>the people of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me but <f>ⓤ</f>one lot and one portion as an inheritance, although I am <f>ⓥ</f>a numerous people, since all along the LORD has blessed me?”
17-15 And Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up by yourselves to the forest, and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and <f>ⓦ</f>the Rephaim, since <f>ⓧ</f>the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”
17-16 The people of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us. Yet all the Canaanites who dwell in the plain have <f>ⓨ</f>chariots of iron, both those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in <f>ⓩ</f>the Valley of Jezreel.”
17-17 Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, “You are a numerous people and have great power. You shall not have one allotment only,
17-18 but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders. For you shall drive out the Canaanites, <f>ⓐ</f>though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.”
91-1 <pb/><t>He who dwells in <f>ⓐ</f>the shelter of the Most High </t><t>will abide in <f>ⓑ</f>the shadow of the Almighty.</t>
91-2 <t>I will say <f>[1]</f> to the LORD, “My <f>ⓒ</f>refuge and my <f>ⓓ</f>fortress, </t><t>my God, in whom I <f>ⓔ</f>trust.” </t>
91-3 <pb/><t>For he will deliver you from <f>ⓕ</f>the snare of the fowler </t><t>and from the deadly pestilence.</t>
91-4 <t>He will <f>ⓖ</f>cover you with his pinions, </t><t>and under his <f>ⓗ</f>wings you will <f>ⓘ</f>find refuge; </t><t>his <f>ⓙ</f>faithfulness is <f>ⓚ</f>a shield and buckler.</t>
91-5 <t><f>ⓛ</f> You will not fear <f>ⓜ</f>the terror of the night, </t><t>nor the arrow that flies by day,</t>
91-6 <t>nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, </t><t>nor the destruction that wastes at noonday. </t>
91-7 <pb/><t>A thousand may fall at your side, </t><t>ten thousand at your right hand, </t><t>but it will not come near you.</t>
91-8 <t>You will only look with your eyes </t><t>and <f>ⓝ</f>see the recompense of the wicked. </t>
91-9 <pb/><t>Because you have made the LORD your <f>ⓞ</f>dwelling place — </t><t>the Most High, who is my <f>ⓟ</f>refuge <f>[2]</f> — </t>
91-10 <t><f>ⓠ</f> no evil shall be allowed to befall you, </t><t><f>ⓡ</f>no plague come near your tent. </t>
91-11 <pb/><t><f>ⓢ</f> For he will command his <f>ⓣ</f>angels concerning you </t><t>to <f>ⓤ</f>guard you in all your ways.</t>
91-12 <t>On their hands they will bear you up, </t><t>lest you <f>ⓥ</f>strike your foot against a stone.</t>
91-13 <t>You will tread on <f>ⓦ</f>the lion and the <f>ⓧ</f>adder; </t><t>the young lion and <f>ⓨ</f>the serpent you will <f>ⓩ</f>trample underfoot. </t>
91-14 <pb/><t>“Because he <f>ⓐ</f>holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; </t><t>I will protect him, because he <f>ⓑ</f>knows my name.</t>
91-15 <t>When he <f>ⓒ</f>calls to me, I will answer him; </t><t>I will be with him in trouble; </t><t>I will rescue him and <f>ⓓ</f>honor him.</t>
91-16 <t>With <f>ⓔ</f>long life I will satisfy him </t><t>and <f>ⓕ</f>show him my salvation.” </t>
5-1 <pb/>Seeing the crowds, <f>ⓐ</f>he went up on the mountain, and when he <f>ⓑ</f>sat down, his disciples came to him.
5-2 <pb/>And <f>ⓒ</f>he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:
5-3 <pb/><J><f>ⓓ</f> “Blessed are <f>ⓔ</f>the poor in spirit, for <f>ⓕ</f>theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</J>
5-4 <pb/><J>“Blessed are <f>ⓖ</f>those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</J>
5-5 <pb/><J>“Blessed are the <f>ⓗ</f>meek, for they <f>ⓘ</f>shall inherit the earth.</J>
5-6 <pb/><J>“Blessed are those who hunger and <f>ⓙ</f>thirst <f>ⓚ</f>for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</J>
5-7 <pb/><J>“Blessed are <f>ⓛ</f>the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.</J>
5-8 <pb/><J>“Blessed are <f>ⓜ</f>the pure in heart, for <f>ⓝ</f>they shall see God.</J>
5-9 <pb/><J>“Blessed are <f>ⓞ</f>the peacemakers, for <f>ⓟ</f>they shall be called <f>ⓠ</f>sons <f>[1]</f> of God.</J>
5-10 <pb/><J><f>ⓡ</f> “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for <f>ⓢ</f>theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</J>
5-11 <pb/><J><f>ⓣ</f> “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely <f>ⓤ</f>on my account.</J>
5-12 <J><f>ⓥ</f> Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for <f>ⓦ</f>so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</J>
5-13 <pb/><J>“You are the salt of the earth, <f>ⓧ</f>but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.</J>
5-14 <pb/><J><f>ⓨ</f> “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.</J>
5-15 <J><f>ⓩ</f> Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.</J>
5-16 <J>In the same way, let your light shine before others, so <f>ⓐ</f>that <f>[2]</f> they may see your good works and <f>ⓑ</f>give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</J>
5-17 <pb/><J><f>ⓒ</f> “Do not think that I have come to abolish <f>ⓓ</f>the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but <f>ⓔ</f>to fulfill them.</J>
5-18 <J>For truly, I say to you, <f>ⓕ</f>until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</J>
5-19 <J><f>ⓖ</f> Therefore whoever relaxes <f>ⓗ</f>one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least <f>ⓘ</f>in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great <f>ⓙ</f>in the kingdom of heaven.</J>
5-20 <J>For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds <f>ⓚ</f>that of the scribes and Pharisees, you <f>ⓛ</f>will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</J>
5-21 <pb/><J><f>ⓜ</f> “You have heard that it was said to those of old, <f>ⓝ</f>‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable <f>ⓞ</f>to judgment.’</J>
5-22 <J>But I say to you that <f>ⓟ</f>everyone who is angry with his brother <f>[3]</f> will be liable <f>ⓠ</f>to judgment; whoever insults <f>[4]</f> his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to <f>ⓡ</f>the hell <f>[5]</f> of fire.</J>
5-23 <J><f>ⓢ</f> So if <f>ⓣ</f>you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</J>
5-24 <J>leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</J>
5-25 <J><f>ⓤ</f> Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison.</J>
5-26 <J>Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓥ</f>you will never get out until you have paid the last penny. <f>[6]</f></J>
5-27 <pb/><J><f>ⓦ</f> “You have heard that it was said, <f>ⓧ</f>‘You shall not commit adultery.’</J>
5-28 <J>But I say to you that <f>ⓨ</f>everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</J>
5-29 <J><f>ⓩ</f> If your right eye <f>ⓐ</f>causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into <f>ⓑ</f>hell.</J>
5-30 <J><f>ⓒ</f> And if your right hand <f>ⓓ</f>causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into <f>ⓔ</f>hell.</J>

5-36 <J>And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</J>
5-37 <J>Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; <f>ⓟ</f>anything more than this comes from evil. <f>[7]</f></J>
5-38 <pb/><J><f>ⓠ</f> “You have heard that it was said, <f>ⓡ</f>‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</J>
5-39 <J>But I say to you, <f>ⓢ</f>Do not resist the one who is evil. But <f>ⓣ</f>if anyone <f>ⓤ</f>slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.</J>
5-40 <J>And <f>ⓥ</f>if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, <f>[8]</f> let him have your cloak as well.</J>
5-41 <J>And if anyone <f>ⓦ</f>forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.</J>
5-42 <J><f>ⓧ</f> Give to the one who begs from you, and <f>ⓨ</f>do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.</J>

5-44 <J>But I say to you, <f>ⓑ</f>Love your enemies and <f>ⓒ</f>pray for those who persecute you,</J>
5-45 <J><f>ⓓ</f> so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and <f>ⓔ</f>sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</J>
5-46 <J><f>ⓕ</f> For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?</J>
5-47 <J>And if you greet only your brothers, <f>[9]</f> what more are you doing than others? Do not even <f>ⓖ</f>the Gentiles do the same?</J>
5-48 <J><f>ⓗ</f> You therefore must be <f>ⓘ</f>perfect, <f>ⓙ</f>as your heavenly Father is perfect.</J>
