Exodus 24-1 <pb/>Then he said to Moses, “Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, <f>ⓐ</f>Nadab, and Abihu, and <f>ⓑ</f>seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar.
Exodus 24-2 Moses <f>ⓒ</f>alone shall come near to the LORD, but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him.”
Exodus 24-3 <pb/>Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD and <f>ⓓ</f>all the rules. <f>[1]</f> And all the people answered with one voice and said, <f>ⓔ</f>“All the words that the LORD has spoken we will do.”
Exodus 24-4 And <f>ⓕ</f>Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve <f>ⓖ</f>pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
Exodus 24-5 And he sent young men of the people of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.
Exodus 24-6 And <f>ⓗ</f>Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar.
Exodus 24-7 Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, <f>ⓘ</f>“All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient.”
Exodus 24-8 <f>ⓙ</f> And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.”
Exodus 24-9 <pb/>Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and <f>ⓚ</f>seventy of the elders of Israel <f>ⓛ</f>went up,
Exodus 24-10 and they <f>ⓜ</f>saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of <f>ⓝ</f>sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness.
Exodus 24-11 And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and <f>ⓞ</f>ate and drank.
Exodus 24-12 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses, <f>ⓟ</f>“Come up to me on the mountain and wait there, that I may give you the <f>ⓠ</f>tablets of stone, with the law and the commandment, which I have written for their instruction.”
Exodus 24-13 So Moses rose with his assistant <f>ⓡ</f>Joshua, and Moses went up <f>ⓢ</f>into the mountain of God.
Exodus 24-14 And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and <f>ⓣ</f>Hur are with you. Whoever has a dispute, let him go to them.”
Exodus 24-15 <pb/>Then Moses went up on the mountain, and <f>ⓤ</f>the cloud covered the mountain.
Exodus 24-16 <f>ⓥ</f> The glory of the LORD dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
Exodus 24-17 Now the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a <f>ⓦ</f>devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the sight of the people of Israel.
Exodus 24-18 Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses <f>ⓧ</f>was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
Job 3-1 <pb/>After this Job <f>ⓐ</f>opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
Job 3-2 And Job said:
Job 3-3 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> “Let the day perish on which I was born, </t><t>and the night that said, </t><t>‘A man is conceived.’</t>
Job 3-4 <t>Let that day be darkness! </t><t>May God above not seek it, </t><t>nor light shine upon it.</t>
Job 3-5 <t>Let gloom and <f>ⓒ</f>deep darkness claim it. </t><t>Let clouds dwell upon it; </t><t>let the blackness of the day terrify it.</t>
Job 3-6 <t>That night — let thick darkness seize it! </t><t>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; </t><t>let it not come into the number of the months.</t>
Job 3-7 <t>Behold, let that night be barren; </t><t>let no joyful cry enter it.</t>
Job 3-8 <t>Let those curse it who curse the day, </t><t>who are ready to rouse up <f>ⓓ</f>Leviathan.</t>
Job 3-9 <t>Let the stars of its dawn be dark; </t><t>let it hope for light, but have none, </t><t>nor see <f>ⓔ</f>the eyelids of the morning,</t>
Job 3-10 <t>because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, </t><t>nor hide trouble from my eyes. </t>
Job 3-11 <pb/><t>“Why <f>ⓕ</f>did I not die at birth, </t><t>come out from the womb and expire?</t>
Job 3-12 <t>Why did <f>ⓖ</f>the knees receive me? </t><t>Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?</t>
Job 3-13 <t>For then I would have lain down and been quiet; </t><t>I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,</t>
Job 3-14 <t>with kings and counselors of the earth </t><t>who <f>ⓗ</f>rebuilt ruins for themselves,</t>
Job 3-15 <t>or with princes who had gold, </t><t>who filled their houses with silver.</t>
Job 3-16 <t>Or why was I not as a hidden <f>ⓘ</f>stillborn child, </t><t>as infants who never see the light?</t>
Job 3-17 <t>There the wicked cease from troubling, </t><t>and there the weary are at <f>ⓙ</f>rest.</t>
Job 3-18 <t>There the prisoners are at ease together; </t><t>they hear not the voice of <f>ⓚ</f>the taskmaster.</t>
Job 3-19 <t>The small and the great are there, </t><t>and the slave is free from his master. </t>
Job 3-20 <pb/><t>“Why is light given to him who is in misery, </t><t>and life to <f>ⓛ</f>the bitter in soul,</t>
Job 3-21 <t>who <f>ⓜ</f>long for death, but it comes not, </t><t>and dig for it more than for <f>ⓝ</f>hidden treasures,</t>
Job 3-22 <t>who rejoice exceedingly </t><t>and are glad when they find the grave?</t>
Job 3-23 <t>Why is light given to a man whose <f>ⓞ</f>way is hidden, </t><t>whom God has <f>ⓟ</f>hedged in?</t>
Job 3-24 <t>For my sighing comes <f>ⓠ</f>instead of <f>[1]</f> my bread, </t><t>and my <f>ⓡ</f>groanings are poured out like water.</t>
Job 3-25 <t><f>ⓢ</f> For the thing that I fear comes upon me, </t><t>and what I dread befalls me.</t>
Job 3-26 <t>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; </t><t>I have no rest, but trouble comes.” </t>
Ezekiel 2-1 <pb/>And he said to me, <f>ⓐ</f>“Son of man, <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓑ</f>stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”
Ezekiel 2-2 And as he spoke to me, <f>ⓒ</f>the Spirit entered into me and <f>ⓓ</f>set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
Ezekiel 2-3 And he said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to <f>ⓔ</f>nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. <f>ⓕ</f>They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.
Ezekiel 2-4 The descendants also are <f>ⓖ</f>impudent and stubborn: I send you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’
Ezekiel 2-5 And <f>ⓗ</f>whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are <f>ⓘ</f>a rebellious house) <f>ⓙ</f>they will know that a prophet has been among them.
Ezekiel 2-6 And you, son of man, <f>ⓚ</f>be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, <f>ⓛ</f>though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on <f>ⓜ</f>scorpions. <f>[2]</f> Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel 2-7 And you shall speak my words to them, <f>ⓝ</f>whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel 2-8 <pb/>“But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. <f>ⓞ</f>Be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and <f>ⓟ</f>eat what I give you.”
Ezekiel 2-9 And when I looked, behold, <f>ⓠ</f>a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, <f>ⓡ</f>a scroll of a book was in it.
Ezekiel 2-10 And he spread it before me. And it had writing <f>ⓢ</f>on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.
Revelation 3-1 <pb/><J>“And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: ‘The words of him <f>ⓐ</f>who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.</J> <pb/><J>“‘I know your works. You have the reputation <f>ⓑ</f>of being alive, <f>ⓒ</f>but you are dead.</J>

Revelation 3-3 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, <f>ⓕ</f>I will come <f>ⓖ</f>like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.</J>
Revelation 3-4 <J>Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not <f>ⓗ</f>soiled their garments, and they will walk with me <f>ⓘ</f>in white, for they are <f>ⓙ</f>worthy.</J>
