Job 22-1 <pb/>Then <f>ⓐ</f>Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job 22-2 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> “Can a man be profitable to God? </t><t>Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</t>
Job 22-3 <t>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right, </t><t>or is it gain to him if you <f>ⓒ</f>make your ways blameless?</t>
Job 22-4 <t>Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you </t><t>and <f>ⓓ</f>enters into judgment with you?</t>
Job 22-5 <t>Is not your evil abundant? </t><t>There is no end to your iniquities.</t>
Job 22-6 <t>For you have <f>ⓔ</f>exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing </t><t><f>ⓕ</f>and stripped the naked of their clothing.</t>
Job 22-7 <t>You have given no water to the weary to drink, </t><t>and you have <f>ⓖ</f>withheld bread from the hungry.</t>
Job 22-8 <t><f>ⓗ</f> The man with power possessed the land, </t><t>and <f>ⓘ</f>the favored man lived in it.</t>

Job 22-11 <t>or <f>ⓝ</f>darkness, so that you cannot see, </t><t>and a <f>ⓞ</f>flood of <f>ⓟ</f>water covers you. </t>
Job 22-12 <pb/><t>“Is not God high in the heavens? </t><t>See <f>ⓠ</f>the highest stars, how lofty they are!</t>

Job 22-15 <t>Will you keep to the old way </t><t>that wicked men have trod?</t>
Job 22-16 <t>They were snatched away <f>ⓤ</f>before their time; </t><t>their foundation was washed away. <f>[1]</f></t>
Job 22-17 <t>They said to God, <f>ⓥ</f>‘Depart from us,’ </t><t>and <f>ⓦ</f>‘What can the Almighty do to us?’ <f>[2]</f></t>
Job 22-18 <t>Yet he filled their houses with good things — </t><t>but <f>ⓧ</f>the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</t>
Job 22-19 <t><f>ⓨ</f> The righteous see it and are glad; </t><t>the innocent one <f>ⓩ</f>mocks at them,</t>

Job 22-30 <t>He <f>ⓠ</f>delivers even the one who is not innocent, </t><t>who will be delivered through <f>ⓡ</f>the cleanness of your hands.” </t>
Ezekiel 21-1 <pb/><f>[1]</f> The word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 21-2 <f>ⓐ</f> “Son of man, <f>ⓑ</f>set your face toward Jerusalem and <f>ⓒ</f>preach against the sanctuaries. <f>[2]</f> Prophesy against the land of Israel
Ezekiel 21-3 and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: <f>ⓓ</f>Behold, I am against you and will draw <f>ⓔ</f>my sword from its sheath and <f>ⓕ</f>will cut off from you both righteous and wicked.
Ezekiel 21-4 Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north.
Ezekiel 21-5 <f>ⓖ</f> And all flesh shall know that I am the LORD. I have drawn <f>ⓗ</f>my sword from its sheath; <f>ⓘ</f>it shall not be sheathed again.
Ezekiel 21-6 <pb/>“As for you, son of man, <f>ⓙ</f>groan; with breaking heart and bitter grief, <f>ⓚ</f>groan before their eyes.
Ezekiel 21-7 <f>ⓛ</f> And when they say to you, ‘Why do you groan?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the news <f>ⓜ</f>that it is coming. <f>ⓝ</f>Every heart will melt, and <f>ⓞ</f>all hands will be feeble; every spirit will faint, and <f>ⓟ</f>all knees will be weak as water. <f>ⓠ</f>Behold, it is <f>ⓡ</f>coming, and it will be fulfilled,’” declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 21-8 <pb/>And the word of the LORD came to me:
Ezekiel 21-9 <f>ⓢ</f> “Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, say: <pb/><t><f>ⓣ</f>“A sword, a sword is sharpened </t><t>and also polished,</t>
Ezekiel 21-10 <t><f>ⓤ</f> sharpened for slaughter, </t><t><f>ⓥ</f>polished to flash like lightning! </t> <pb/>(Or <f>ⓦ</f>shall we rejoice? You have despised the rod, my son, <f>ⓧ</f>with everything of wood.) <f>[3]</f>
Ezekiel 21-11 So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished <f>ⓨ</f>to be given into the hand of the slayer.
Ezekiel 21-12 <f>ⓩ</f> Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people. It is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. <f>ⓐ</f>Strike therefore upon your thigh.
Ezekiel 21-13 For it will not be a testing — what could it do if you despise <f>ⓑ</f>the rod?” <f>[4]</f> declares the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 21-14 <pb/>“As for you, <f>ⓒ</f>son of man, prophesy. <f>ⓓ</f>Clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, <f>ⓔ</f>yes, three times, <f>[5]</f> the sword for those to be slain. It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them,
Ezekiel 21-15 that their hearts may melt, and many stumble. <f>[6]</f> At all their gates I have given the glittering sword. Ah, it is made like lightning; <f>ⓕ</f>it is taken up <f>[7]</f> for slaughter.
Ezekiel 21-16 Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your face is directed.
Ezekiel 21-17 I also will <f>ⓖ</f>clap my hands, <f>ⓗ</f>and I will satisfy my fury; <f>ⓘ</f>I the LORD have spoken.”
Ezekiel 21-18 <pb/>The word of the LORD came to me again:
Ezekiel 21-19 “As for you, son of man, mark two ways for <f>ⓙ</f>the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same land. And make <f>ⓚ</f>a signpost; make it <f>ⓛ</f>at the head of the way to a city.
Ezekiel 21-20 Mark a way <f>ⓜ</f>for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, into Jerusalem the fortified.
Ezekiel 21-21 For the king of Babylon stands <f>ⓝ</f>at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows; he consults <f>ⓞ</f>the teraphim; <f>[8]</f> he looks at the liver.
Ezekiel 21-22 Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem, <f>ⓟ</f>to set battering rams, to open the mouth with murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, <f>ⓠ</f>to cast up mounds, to build siege towers.
Ezekiel 21-23 But to them it will seem like a false divination. <f>ⓡ</f>They have sworn solemn oaths, but he brings their guilt to remembrance, <f>ⓢ</f>that they may be taken.
Ezekiel 21-24 <pb/>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear — because you have come to remembrance, <f>ⓣ</f>you shall be taken in hand.
Ezekiel 21-25 And you, O profane <f>[9]</f> <f>ⓤ</f>wicked one, prince of Israel, <f>ⓥ</f>whose day has come, <f>ⓦ</f>the time of your final punishment,
Ezekiel 21-26 thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. <f>ⓧ</f>Exalt that which is low, and bring low that which is exalted.
Ezekiel 21-27 A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it. <f>ⓨ</f>This also shall not be, <f>ⓩ</f>until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him.
Ezekiel 21-28 <pb/>“And you, <f>ⓐ</f>son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD <f>ⓑ</f>concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; say, <f>ⓒ</f>A sword, a sword <f>ⓓ</f>is drawn for the slaughter. <f>ⓔ</f>It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning —
Ezekiel 21-29 while <f>ⓕ</f>they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you — to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, <f>ⓖ</f>whose day has come, the time of their final punishment.
Ezekiel 21-30 <f>ⓗ</f> Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, <f>ⓘ</f>I will judge you.
Ezekiel 21-31 And <f>ⓙ</f>I will pour out my indignation upon you; <f>ⓚ</f>I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of <f>ⓛ</f>brutish men, skillful to destroy.
Ezekiel 21-32 You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. <f>ⓜ</f>You shall be no more remembered, <f>ⓝ</f>for I the LORD have spoken.”
Revelation 22-1 <pb/>Then the angel <f>[1]</f> showed me <f>ⓐ</f>the river of <f>ⓑ</f>the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
Revelation 22-2 through the middle of <f>ⓒ</f>the street of the city; <f>ⓓ</f>also, on either side of the river, <f>ⓔ</f>the tree of life <f>[2]</f> with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were <f>ⓕ</f>for the healing of the nations.
Revelation 22-3 <f>ⓖ</f> No longer will there be anything accursed, but <f>ⓗ</f>the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and <f>ⓘ</f>his servants will worship him.
Revelation 22-4 <f>ⓙ</f> They will see his face, and <f>ⓚ</f>his name will be on their foreheads.
Revelation 22-5 And <f>ⓛ</f>night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp <f>ⓜ</f>or sun, for <f>ⓝ</f>the Lord God will be their light, and <f>ⓞ</f>they will reign forever and ever.
Revelation 22-6 <pb/>And he said to me, <f>ⓟ</f>“These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of <f>ⓠ</f>the spirits of the prophets, <f>ⓡ</f>has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place.”
Revelation 22-7 <pb/><J>“And behold, <f>ⓢ</f>I am coming soon. <f>ⓣ</f>Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”</J>
Revelation 22-8 <pb/>I, <f>ⓤ</f>John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, <f>ⓥ</f>I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me,
Revelation 22-9 <f>ⓦ</f> but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those <f>ⓧ</f>who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”
Revelation 22-10 <pb/>And he said to me, <f>ⓨ</f>“Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
Revelation 22-11 <f>ⓩ</f> Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.”
Revelation 22-12 <pb/><J>“Behold, <f>ⓐ</f>I am coming soon, <f>ⓑ</f>bringing my recompense with me, <f>ⓒ</f>to repay each one for what he has done.</J>
Revelation 22-13 <J><f>ⓓ</f> I am the Alpha and the Omega, <f>ⓔ</f>the first and the last, <f>ⓕ</f>the beginning and the end.”</J>
Revelation 22-14 <pb/>Blessed are those who <f>ⓖ</f>wash their robes, <f>[3]</f> so that they may have the right to <f>ⓗ</f>the tree of life and that <f>ⓘ</f>they may enter the city by the gates.
Revelation 22-15 <f>ⓙ</f> Outside are <f>ⓚ</f>the dogs <f>ⓛ</f>and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
Revelation 22-16 <pb/><J><f>ⓜ</f> “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things <f>ⓝ</f>for the churches. I am <f>ⓞ</f>the root and <f>ⓟ</f>the descendant of David, <f>ⓠ</f>the bright morning star.”</J>
Revelation 22-17 <pb/>The Spirit and <f>ⓡ</f>the Bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” And <f>ⓢ</f>let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the <f>ⓣ</f>water of life without price.
Revelation 22-18 <pb/>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: <f>ⓤ</f>if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book,
Revelation 22-19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in <f>ⓥ</f>the tree of life and in <f>ⓦ</f>the holy city, which are described in this book.
Revelation 22-20 <pb/>He who testifies to these things says, <J>“Surely <f>ⓧ</f>I am coming soon.”</J> Amen. <f>ⓨ</f>Come, Lord Jesus!
Revelation 22-21 <pb/>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. <f>[4]</f> Amen.
