31-1 <pb/>The LORD said to Moses,
31-2 “See, I have called by name <f>ⓐ</f>Bezalel the son of Uri, son of <f>ⓑ</f>Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
31-3 and I have <f>ⓒ</f>filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship,
31-4 to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze,
31-5 in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, to work in every craft.
31-6 And behold, I have appointed with him <f>ⓓ</f>Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And I have given to all able men <f>ⓔ</f>ability, that they may make all that I have commanded you:
31-7 <f>ⓕ</f> the tent of meeting, and <f>ⓖ</f>the ark of the testimony, and <f>ⓗ</f>the mercy seat that is on it, and all the furnishings of the tent,
31-8 <f>ⓘ</f> the table and its utensils, and <f>ⓙ</f>the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and <f>ⓚ</f>the altar of incense,
31-9 and <f>ⓛ</f>the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and <f>ⓜ</f>the basin and its stand,
31-10 and <f>ⓝ</f>the finely worked garments, <f>[1]</f> the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, for their service as priests,
31-11 and <f>ⓞ</f>the anointing oil and the fragrant <f>ⓟ</f>incense for the Holy Place. According to all that I have commanded you, they shall do.”
31-12 <pb/>And the LORD said to Moses,
31-13 “You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, ‘Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the LORD, sanctify you.
31-14 You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. <f>ⓠ</f>Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
31-15 <f>ⓡ</f> Six days shall work be done, but <f>ⓢ</f>the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. <f>ⓣ</f>Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.
31-16 Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a covenant forever.
31-17 <f>ⓤ</f> It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that <f>ⓥ</f>in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and <f>ⓦ</f>on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’”
31-18 <pb/>And he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the <f>ⓧ</f>two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with <f>ⓨ</f>the finger of God.
10-1 <pb/><t>“I <f>ⓐ</f>loathe my life; </t><t>I will give free utterance to my <f>ⓑ</f>complaint; </t><t>I will speak in <f>ⓒ</f>the bitterness of my soul.</t>
10-2 <t>I will say to God, Do not <f>ⓓ</f>condemn me; </t><t>let me know why you <f>ⓔ</f>contend against me.</t>
10-3 <t><f>ⓕ</f> Does it seem good to you to oppress, </t><t>to despise <f>ⓖ</f>the work of your hands </t><t><f>ⓗ</f>and favor the designs of the wicked?</t>
10-4 <t>Have you <f>ⓘ</f>eyes of flesh? </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>Do you see as man sees?</t>
10-5 <t>Are your days as the days of man, </t><t>or your <f>ⓚ</f>years as a man's years,</t>
10-6 <t>that you <f>ⓛ</f>seek out my iniquity </t><t>and search for my sin,</t>
10-7 <t>although you <f>ⓜ</f>know that I am not guilty, </t><t>and there is <f>ⓝ</f>none to deliver out of your hand?</t>
10-8 <t><f>ⓞ</f> Your hands fashioned and made me, </t><t>and now you have destroyed me altogether.</t>
10-9 <t>Remember that you have made me like <f>ⓟ</f>clay; </t><t>and will you return me to the <f>ⓠ</f>dust?</t>
10-10 <t>Did you not pour me out like milk </t><t>and curdle me like cheese?</t>
10-11 <t>You clothed me with skin and flesh, </t><t>and knit me together with bones and sinews.</t>
10-12 <t>You have granted me life and steadfast love, </t><t>and your care has preserved my spirit.</t>
10-13 <t>Yet these things you hid in your heart; </t><t>I know that <f>ⓡ</f>this was your purpose.</t>
10-14 <t>If I sin, you <f>ⓢ</f>watch me </t><t>and do not <f>ⓣ</f>acquit me of my iniquity.</t>
10-15 <t><f>ⓤ</f> If I am guilty, woe to me! </t><t>If I am <f>ⓥ</f>in the right, I cannot lift up my head, </t><t>for I am filled with disgrace </t><t>and <f>ⓦ</f>look on my affliction.</t>
10-16 <t>And were my head lifted up, <f>[1]</f> you would hunt me like <f>ⓧ</f>a lion </t><t>and again work <f>ⓨ</f>wonders against me.</t>
10-17 <t>You renew your <f>ⓩ</f>witnesses against me </t><t>and increase your vexation toward me; </t><t>you <f>ⓐ</f>bring fresh troops against me. </t>
10-18 <pb/><t><f>ⓑ</f> “Why did you bring me out from the womb? </t><t>Would that I had died before any eye had seen me</t>
10-19 <t><f>ⓒ</f> and were as though I had not been, </t><t>carried from the womb to the grave.</t>
10-20 <t><f>ⓓ</f> Are not my days few? </t><t><f>ⓔ</f>Then cease, and leave me alone, <f>ⓕ</f>that I may find a little cheer</t>
10-21 <t>before I go — and <f>ⓖ</f>I shall not return — </t><t>to the land of <f>ⓗ</f>darkness and <f>ⓘ</f>deep shadow,</t>
10-22 <t>the land of gloom like thick darkness, </t><t>like deep shadow without any order, </t><t>where light is as thick darkness.” </t>
9-1 <pb/>Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Bring near the executioners of the city, <f>ⓐ</f>each with his destroying weapon in his hand.”
9-2 And behold, six men came from the direction of <f>ⓑ</f>the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was <f>ⓒ</f>a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. And they went in and stood beside <f>ⓓ</f>the bronze altar.
9-3 <pb/>Now <f>ⓔ</f>the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to <f>ⓕ</f>the threshold of the house. And he called to <f>ⓖ</f>the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist.
9-4 And the LORD said to him, “Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and <f>ⓗ</f>put a mark on the foreheads of the men who <f>ⓘ</f>sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it.”
9-5 And to <f>ⓙ</f>the others he said in my hearing, “Pass through the city after him, and strike. <f>ⓚ</f>Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.
9-6 <f>ⓛ</f> Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but <f>ⓜ</f>touch no one on whom is the mark. And <f>ⓝ</f>begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the house.
9-7 Then he said to them, <f>ⓞ</f>“Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out.” So they went out and struck in the city.
9-8 And while they were striking, and I was left alone, <f>ⓟ</f>I fell upon my face, and cried, <f>ⓠ</f>“Ah, Lord GOD! <f>ⓡ</f>Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel <f>ⓢ</f>in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”
9-9 <pb/>Then he said to me, <f>ⓣ</f>“The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. <f>ⓤ</f>The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For <f>ⓥ</f>they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.’
9-10 As for me, <f>ⓦ</f>my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; <f>ⓧ</f>I will bring their deeds upon their heads.”
9-11 <pb/>And behold, <f>ⓨ</f>the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded me.”
10-1 <pb/>Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with <f>ⓐ</f>a rainbow over his head, and <f>ⓑ</f>his face was like the sun, and <f>ⓒ</f>his legs like pillars of fire.
10-2 <f>ⓓ</f> He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land,
10-3 and called out with a loud voice, <f>ⓔ</f>like a lion roaring. When he called out, the seven thunders sounded.
10-4 And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, <f>ⓕ</f>“Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.”
10-5 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land <f>ⓖ</f>raised his right hand to heaven
10-6 and swore by <f>ⓗ</f>him who lives forever and ever, <f>ⓘ</f>who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay,
10-7 but that <f>ⓙ</f>in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God would be fulfilled, <f>ⓚ</f>just as he announced to his servants the prophets.
10-8 <pb/>Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”
10-9 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, <f>ⓛ</f>“Take and <f>ⓜ</f>eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”
10-10 And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter.
10-11 And I was told, <f>ⓝ</f>“You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and languages and kings.”
