19-1 <pb/>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. <f>ⓐ</f>But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.
19-2 And Jonathan told David, “Saul my father seeks to kill you. Therefore be on your guard in the morning. Stay in a secret place and hide yourself.
19-3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you. And if I learn anything I will tell you.”
19-4 And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “Let not the king <f>ⓑ</f>sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have brought good to you.
19-5 For <f>ⓒ</f>he took his life in his hand <f>ⓓ</f>and he struck down the Philistine, <f>ⓔ</f>and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against <f>ⓕ</f>innocent blood by killing David without cause?”
19-6 And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan. Saul swore, <f>ⓖ</f>“As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.”
19-7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan reported to him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence <f>ⓗ</f>as before.
19-8 <pb/>And there was war again. And David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great blow, so that they fled before him.
19-9 <f>ⓘ</f> Then a harmful spirit from the LORD came upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. <f>ⓙ</f>And David was playing the lyre.
19-10 <f>ⓚ</f> And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.
19-11 <pb/><f>ⓛ</f> Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, “If you do not escape with your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.”
19-12 <f>ⓜ</f> So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled away and escaped.
19-13 Michal took <f>ⓝ</f>an image <f>[1]</f> and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats' hair at its head and covered it with the clothes.
19-14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”
19-15 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.”
19-16 And when the messengers came in, behold, <f>ⓞ</f>the image was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.
19-17 Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go. <f>ⓟ</f>Why should I kill you?’”
19-18 <pb/>Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at <f>ⓠ</f>Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth.
19-19 And it was told Saul, “Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.”
19-20 Then Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, <f>ⓡ</f>the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, <f>ⓢ</f>and they also prophesied.
19-21 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, <f>ⓣ</f>and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, <f>ⓤ</f>and they also prophesied.
19-22 Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” And one said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in <f>ⓥ</f>Ramah.”
19-23 And he went there to Naioth in Ramah. <f>ⓦ</f>And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
19-24 <f>ⓧ</f> And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night. Thus it is said, <f>ⓨ</f>“Is Saul also among the prophets?”
142-1 <f>[1]</f> <f>ⓐ</f> <pb/><t>With my voice I <f>ⓑ</f>cry out to the LORD; </t><t>with my voice I <f>ⓒ</f>plead for mercy to the LORD.</t>
142-2 <t>I <f>ⓓ</f>pour out my complaint before him; </t><t>I tell my trouble before him. </t>
142-3 <pb/><t>When my spirit <f>ⓔ</f>faints within me, </t><t>you know my way! </t><t>In the path where I walk </t><t>they have <f>ⓕ</f>hidden a trap for me.</t>
142-4 <t><f>ⓖ</f> Look to the <f>ⓗ</f>right and see: </t><t><f>ⓘ</f>there is none who takes notice of me; </t><t><f>ⓙ</f>no refuge remains to me; </t><t>no one cares for my soul. </t>
142-5 <pb/><t>I cry to you, O LORD; </t><t>I say, “You are my <f>ⓚ</f>refuge, </t><t>my <f>ⓛ</f>portion in <f>ⓜ</f>the land of the living.”</t>
142-6 <t><f>ⓝ</f> Attend to my cry, </t><t>for <f>ⓞ</f>I am brought very low! </t><t>Deliver me from my persecutors, </t><t><f>ⓟ</f>for they are too strong for me!</t>
142-7 <t><f>ⓠ</f> Bring me out of prison, </t><t>that I may give thanks to your name! </t><t>The righteous will surround me, </t><t>for you will <f>ⓡ</f>deal bountifully with me. </t>
12-1 <pb/>In the meantime, <f>ⓐ</f>when so many thousands of the people had gathered together that they were trampling one another, he began to say to his disciples first, <J> <f>ⓑ</f>“Beware of <f>ⓒ</f>the leaven of the Pharisees, <f>ⓓ</f>which is hypocrisy.</J>
12-2 <J><f>ⓔ</f> Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.</J>
12-3 <J>Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in <f>ⓕ</f>private rooms shall be proclaimed on <f>ⓖ</f>the housetops.</J>
12-4 <pb/><J>“I tell you, my friends, <f>ⓗ</f>do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do.</J>
12-5 <J>But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him <f>ⓘ</f>who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. <f>[1]</f> Yes, I tell you, fear him!</J>
12-6 <J>Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? <f>[2]</f> And <f>ⓙ</f>not one of them is forgotten before God.</J>
12-7 <J>Why, <f>ⓚ</f>even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; <f>ⓛ</f>you are of more value than many sparrows.</J>
12-8 <pb/><J>“And I tell you, <f>ⓜ</f>everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man also will acknowledge <f>ⓝ</f>before the angels of God,</J>
12-9 <J>but <f>ⓞ</f>the one who denies me before men <f>ⓟ</f>will be denied <f>ⓠ</f>before the angels of God.</J>
12-10 <J>And <f>ⓡ</f>everyone who speaks a word <f>ⓢ</f>against the Son of Man <f>ⓣ</f>will be forgiven, but the one who <f>ⓤ</f>blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</J>
12-11 <J><f>ⓥ</f> And when they <f>ⓦ</f>bring you before the synagogues and <f>ⓧ</f>the rulers and <f>ⓨ</f>the authorities, <f>ⓩ</f>do not be anxious about how you should defend yourself or what you should say,</J>
12-12 <J><f>ⓐ</f> for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.”</J>
12-13 <pb/><f>ⓑ</f> Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”
12-14 But he said to him, <J> <f>ⓒ</f>“Man, <f>ⓓ</f>who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?”</J>
12-15 And he said to them, <J> <f>ⓔ</f>“Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”</J>
12-16 And he told them a parable, saying, <J> <f>ⓕ</f>“The land of a rich man produced plentifully,</J>
12-17 <J>and he thought to himself, <f>ⓖ</f>‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’</J>
12-18 <J>And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my <f>ⓗ</f>barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</J>
12-19 <J>And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have ample goods laid up <f>ⓘ</f>for many years; relax, <f>ⓙ</f>eat, drink, be merry.”’</J>
12-20 <J>But God said to him, <f>ⓚ</f>‘Fool! <f>ⓛ</f>This night <f>ⓜ</f>your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, <f>ⓝ</f>whose will they be?’</J>
12-21 <J>So is the one <f>ⓞ</f>who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.”</J>
12-22 <pb/>And he said to his disciples, <J> <f>ⓟ</f>“Therefore I tell you, <f>ⓠ</f>do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on.</J>
12-23 <J>For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.</J>
12-24 <J><f>ⓡ</f> Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. <f>ⓢ</f>Of how much more value are you than the birds!</J>
12-25 <J>And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his <f>ⓣ</f>span of life? <f>[3]</f></J>
12-26 <J>If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest?</J>
12-27 <J>Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, <f>[4]</f> yet I tell you, <f>ⓤ</f>even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</J>
12-28 <J>But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, <f>ⓥ</f>O you of little faith!</J>
12-29 <J>And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor <f>ⓦ</f>be worried.</J>
12-30 <J>For <f>ⓧ</f>all the nations of the world seek after these things, and <f>ⓨ</f>your Father knows that you need them.</J>
12-31 <J>Instead, <f>ⓩ</f>seek <f>ⓐ</f>his <f>[5]</f> kingdom, <f>ⓑ</f>and these things will be added to you.</J>
12-32 <pb/><J><f>ⓒ</f> “Fear not, little <f>ⓓ</f>flock, for <f>ⓔ</f>it is your Father's good pleasure to give you <f>ⓕ</f>the kingdom.</J>
12-33 <J><f>ⓖ</f> Sell your possessions, and <f>ⓗ</f>give to the needy. <f>ⓘ</f>Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with <f>ⓙ</f>a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.</J>
12-34 <J><f>ⓚ</f> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</J>
12-35 <pb/><J><f>ⓛ</f> “Stay dressed for action <f>[6]</f> and <f>ⓜ</f>keep your lamps burning,</J>
12-36 <J>and be like men who are <f>ⓝ</f>waiting for their master to come home from the wedding feast, so that they may open the door to him at once when he comes and <f>ⓞ</f>knocks.</J>
12-37 <J><f>ⓟ</f> Blessed are those servants <f>[7]</f> whom the master finds <f>ⓠ</f>awake when he comes. Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓡ</f>he will dress himself for service and <f>ⓢ</f>have them recline at table, and he will come and serve them.</J>
12-38 <J>If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them awake, blessed are those servants!</J>
12-39 <J><f>ⓣ</f> But know this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour <f>ⓤ</f>the thief was coming, he <f>[8]</f> would not have left his house to be broken into.</J>
12-40 <J>You also must be <f>ⓥ</f>ready, for <f>ⓦ</f>the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”</J>
12-41 <pb/>Peter said, “Lord, <f>ⓧ</f>are you telling this parable for us or for all?”
12-42 And the Lord said, <J>“Who then is <f>ⓨ</f>the faithful and <f>ⓩ</f>wise <f>ⓐ</f>manager, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?</J>
12-43 <J><f>ⓑ</f> Blessed is that servant <f>[9]</f> whom his master will find so doing when he comes.</J>
12-44 <J>Truly, I say to you, <f>ⓒ</f>he will set him over all his possessions.</J>
12-45 <J>But if that servant says to himself, ‘My master <f>ⓓ</f>is delayed in coming,’ and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and <f>ⓔ</f>get drunk,</J>
12-46 <J>the master of that servant will come <f>ⓕ</f>on a day when he does not expect him and <f>ⓖ</f>at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful.</J>
12-47 <J><f>ⓗ</f> And that servant who <f>ⓘ</f>knew his master's will but <f>ⓙ</f>did not get ready <f>ⓚ</f>or act according to his will, will receive a <f>ⓛ</f>severe beating.</J>
12-48 <J><f>ⓜ</f> But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, <f>ⓝ</f>will receive a light beating. <f>ⓞ</f>Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more.</J>
12-49 <pb/><J><f>ⓟ</f> “I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled!</J>

12-51 <J><f>ⓢ</f> Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? <f>ⓣ</f>No, I tell you, but rather division.</J>

12-54 <pb/>He also said to the crowds, <J> <f>ⓥ</f>“When you see <f>ⓦ</f>a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, ‘A shower is coming.’ And so it happens.</J>
