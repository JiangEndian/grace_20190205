I want to go to Israel to study the HOLY language of Hebrew, and do a research about the effective method of teaching Hebrew to Chinese. I want to study Hebrew first, and then compare the difference of words and grammars between Hebrew and Chinese, so I can find an effective way to teach Hebrew by Chinese. 

One thing inspired me to study Hebrew I must mentioned is that the calling of Paul by Jesus from heaven. Paul heard the voice saying to him in the Hebrew language, and there are some versions of Bible translated this verse saying it's in Aramaic. But in Chinese versions of Bible, it's Hebrew language. Maybe it means in the kingdom of heaven, we will speak Hebrew I think. It's a little kidding, but indeed inspired me somehow. 

Another reason is the Holy Scripture, which written by Hebrew originally. God loves Israel, and gave his words to Israel by the Hebrew language. I think all nations will come to you for the name of God. According the saying of Ruth, 
"your God my God (וַאלֹחַיִךְ אֱלֹהָי)". 

And for better studying effect, can I get a full scholarship? I think it can help me to concentrate on the study and research. 

不用写这些金钱申请. 能给的就会给. 不能给的,那我去不了啊. 哈利路亚, 神拦阻了我. 

还是得要奖学金。否则我能抱怨他说我又没要。我个没良心的。如果知道他要给我又怕我收了反而抱怨，那我就开口要。现在，主啊，求你给我90分托福成绩。。。我前两天想着你给80的，但现在我要90了。。。求你养育我。给我250%学费的奖学金像我看到的那样好。如果更好，我要。我要。我的主。我要，我的神。我要。Feb 26, 2021 9:47:42 AM，昨天兄弟让我买米。我才买了。其实早就想买了。怕他觉得我是傻子。唉呀。初中我不就不知感恩，就是因为我没要，所以给我我也不感恩，反而侮辱对方，极其丑陋。我是说我。现在，主啊，我求你的恩典。我要你的恩典。
