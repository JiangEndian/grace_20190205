I want to go to Israel to study the HOLY language of Hebrew, and do a research about the effective method of teaching Hebrew to Chinese. I want to study Hebrew, and then compare the difference of words and grammars between Hebrew and Chinese, so I can find an effective way to teach Hebrew by Chinese. 

One thing inspired me to study Hebrew I must mentioned is that the calling of Paul by Jesus from heaven. Paul heard the voice saying to him in the Hebrew language, and there are some versions of Bible translated this verse saying it's in Aramaic. But in Chinese versions of Bible, it's Hebrew language. Maybe it means in the kingdom of heaven, we will speak Hebrew I think. It's a little kidding, but indeed inspired me somehow. 

Another reason is the Holy Scripture, which written by Hebrew originally. God loves Israel, and gave his words to Israel by the Hebrew language. I think all nations will come to you for the name of your God. According the saying of Ruth, 
"your God my God (וַאלֹחַיִךְ אֱלֹהָי)". 


不用写这些金钱申请. 能给的就会给. 不能给的,那我去不了啊. 哈利路亚, 神拦阻了我. 
And for better studying effect, I ask for a full scholarship in my study time.
