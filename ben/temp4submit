梦见，20210327,0632,梦见自己在睡着，然后梦到自己睡着做梦起不来，然后妈妈来了，我就起来抱着会，然后想着梦中看不见颜色，于是就对妈妈说，然后一起看地板，咦，没有颜色，我还在梦中，然后梦就破碎了，就想醒来又开始晃晃晃，然后醒了，就特别高兴，就上去找妈妈去，跟她讲你猜我做了什么梦，梦到抱着你结果是在做梦，然后感觉耳朵上塞着东西，不对啊，我应该拿下来了啊，我还在梦中。然后又晃头晃晃晃，又醒了，想着这下醒了吧，就想着休息下，结果又睡过去了。又想起来，又晃晃晃，这下终于醒来了。

她不愿意和“普通的我和骄傲的我”说话。两个你，一个是普通和自卑的你，一个是普通和这个不自卑的你。就不想和这个普通的骄傲的你说话。Fri 02 Apr 2021 08:33:02 PM KST ，梦见和麻姑娘聊天，弹了几下棉花，开始骄傲，然后麻姑娘梦中如此说。嗯。。。

能给人搞食物的，才能成为带领人的领导。Fri 02 Apr 2021 07:03:54 AM KST ，想到昨天会长大人做的食物，真是愿意跟着这样的人。想到金妈妈也是，所以大家都愿意和她接近。然后想到摩西也是，给以色列人吗哪40年。想到耶稣也是，直接喂养大群人。甚至耶稣明说他吸引世人的地方：约翰福音 6-26 耶稣回答说：“我实实在在地告诉你们：你们找我，并不是因见了神迹，乃是因吃饼得饱。
约翰福音 6-27 不要为那必坏的食物劳力，要为那存到永生的食物劳力，就是人子要赐给你们的，因为人子是父　神所印证的。”    （我能像摩西或耶稣那样供应食物吗？甚至使徒们一开始也都是搞食物的。。。后来，发现没时间了得专注于神的话了。嗯。好吧。有些人能搞食物也同时专注神的话。厉害的人。。。但这些专注于神的话的人，他们不搞食物，不是不能，只是不如此而已。他们能。而且，他们能供应大批人食物。他们有如此能力。）
不要接触这些污秽的东西。会把我也变得污秽。Fri 02 Apr 2021 08:40:17 AM KST ，看到个关于猪的，真是，脏，乱。唉呀。然后评论里有人讲本子，唉呀，接触了这污秽的信息，瞬间我的大脑就同污秽了。。。我的大脑不要接触这些污秽的信息。我要去接触神的话。我要思想神的话。昼夜思想。我不要接触污秽的东西。我要圣洁。因为我的神是圣洁的。
诗篇 1-2 惟喜爱耶和华的律法，昼夜思想，这人便为有福。    （我要昼夜接触/昼夜认识神的话语。我完全的属于我的神的。我的灵，完全的属于我的神。合而为一。在他里面成为一。我爱他，所以这是何等的美好啊～～～何等美好的事情，被外人看为可怕。唉。天堂，只有对其百姓来说是天堂啊。对外人来说，是可怕的地方，地狱，唉，才是地狱人向往之地。）
神的咒诅，对地狱人来说是祝福，神的厌恶，对地狱人来说是喜爱。但圣经只是站在神的角度说那是咒诅说那是厌恶吧，并不站地狱人的地狱说是祝福说是喜爱。不对，有这样的角度过。。。
... 你们“喜爱”虚妄、寻找虚假要到几时呢？（细拉）... 好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人有智慧... 示剑的心系恋雅各的女儿底拿，喜爱这女子... 参孙在梭烈谷喜爱一个妇人...惟有恶人和喜爱强暴的人，他心里恨恶...求你救我脱离作孽的人和喜爱流人血的人...（还真的很多这种站在地狱人角度看神所厌恶的为喜爱的事情的记录呢。唉呀。啊。。。他们喜爱。这真没办法。神的厌恶，他们的喜爱，神的咒诅，他们的祝福。唉。。。）
那也都是 delusion. 都是激素的虚假。真实者，只有一。他的话语永远立定。Fri 02 Apr 2021 09:31:41 AM KST ，翻移动硬盘想找写真的，结果找到个真实女友。没错，是虚拟女友。哈哈哈哈。。。真实，虚假，唉。。。然后想到那个喜爱虚假的，我这样算是吗？就把这个放在层层的文件夹里，各种语言的“虚假虚妄”。
然后刚刚想到，人的各样也都是，激素的虚假。甚至，从激素的层面，delusion 还是一样的有真实的激素呢。。。相应的激素倒是真的产生了。。。虚假的，真的。。。真的，虚假的。。。唉呀。。。我要追求神的话语。我要追求真实者。追求他的话语。那立定到永远的真实，一。
我的洞洞鞋，会渗水。我必须得谨慎。不能进入那样的环境。我要活在光明洁净中。Fri 02 Apr 2021 09:56:40 AM KST ，去上厕所，有个小便池有点漏好像。然后我穿的洞洞鞋，看着，就不敢在那尿。换到个相对干净的地方。唉呀。。。我要谨慎。我要活在光明洁净中。避开阴暗污秽的地方。
主啊，求你保守我。保守我。在你的话语中。你是我的避难所，我的安息之处。
不过还是，穿个正常的保护好的鞋好。我干嘛要对抗那样，输了就损失但赢了没收益的事情。。。我的注意力需要更多的投入到我神的话语里面。那是我的生命。永远的生命。Fri 02 Apr 2021 03:12:26 PM KST ，下午回来上厕所刷牙撒尿，找位置时，感觉真是，唉呀，浪费我注意力。我要更多关注我的神的话语。耶稣基督。

我一直记得，你是神的王子。我最近在学一首歌，我们的父我们的王。我们的父是我们的王啊，我们是王子啊。王子收贡品不是理所当然的嘛。Fri 02 Apr 2021 06:31:10 PM KST ，下午遇见蒙恩，蒙恩说收的太多了不好意思了，我就这样说。确实。我得记得，他是神的王子。我要好好对待神的王子。我的王的儿子。我的王都看着呢，我对他儿子的态度。我不要轻视我的王。（而且，一切都是我们的父的啊。他要的，可不是一羊胖死一羊瘦死。这样他要审判肥羊的。）
不敢轻视身为王他。不愿无视他-天地之主的富有啊。害怕有能力完全杀灭我的他。想尊敬并服侍爱到为我受难受死的他。
刚分开的两三天特别想。然后也想不着嘛，慢慢的，可能大脑也保护他自己，就不想了。我是想这一学期得有点时间准备下托福，等7月份考完了再去看你的。平时也少联系，免得太想念。Apr 1, 2021 11:49:11 PM，想到之前的对话。嗯。
又说想念一个人不是好滋味。还是不要的好。这样不要让我知道不要让我看到，就好多了。嗯。。。
换耳机的连接，和换耳朵的连接相比，是不行的。耳朵随时可转到另一个声音，但耳机得操作下。可是这个操作，并不比戴上的操作更复杂多少。而且，就算有常连接，常连接的多个设备的充电也是复杂的操作。Apr 1, 2021 11:52:24 PM，想着以前觉得把耳机换设备连接太繁琐。最近只有一个耳机没办法了，发现也没啥。挺简单快速的。
所以除非是那种频繁繁琐复杂的，就要长久连接。否则，这即不频繁也不繁琐也不复杂，长久连接还会有新的复杂，这样子的情况一段段的短暂合作比较合适。反正长连接也是一段段的合作。。。毕竟量子力学。。。
主啊，求你赐福于houl兄和他的家庭。求你成为他们家庭最重的一个。Apr 2, 2021 12:18:22 AM，祷告时，想到重，与荣耀。求神借着他们家庭，荣耀神。

不应该在听不懂的人面前说他坏话。【利19:14】不可咒骂聋子，也不可将绊脚石放在瞎子面前，只要敬畏你的　神。我是耶和华。Apr 2, 2021 12:32:13 AM，想到刚刚之前当着师母面说不喜欢他。不好。要害怕神。神在看着。不好。只要害怕我的神。敬畏。圣洁。

量子合作。不喜欢也可以在某些量子方面合作嘛。Apr 2, 2021 2:12:56 AM，室友开始活动了，唱歌弹琴，然后我起来上个厕所，想着他不半夜叫朋友在宿舍开party，真的是不错。嗯。虽然是不喜欢，但真的是不错。我跟谁住一起都是不喜欢。那这样的，是挺好的了。。。因为我的自私。。。啊。因为我们的自私，导致我们只顾自己。连喜好都是。。。
他半夜活动吵我睡觉我不喜欢他。我早晨活动吵他睡觉，他又岂能喜欢我呢。。。没法合作。因为是两种人。但也是能的。量子力学嘛。有点就是了。嗯。不错不错。神是好的。（而且，他是弹唱赞美歌，我也是唱赞美歌读圣经。。。啊。。。两个打扰别人的都圣洁无比还。。。还觉得自己特别忍耐了对方给予对方恩典了还。。。）
你也许不知道这对于一个并不觉得自己优秀的人来说意味着什么。
但在当时，无异于一个陌生人用一把刀子深深的扎进你的心窝里，搅了一搅。（说话比实体更有威力啊。也确实，话说造就的实体。。。）【箴12:18】说话浮躁的，如刀刺人，智慧人的舌头，却为医人的良药。
再高明的理论，再严密的逻辑，恐怕也推导不出来人情冷暖，世态炎凉。
（是的。【耶17:9】人心比万物都诡诈，坏到极处，谁能识透呢？    先知预知未来，却无法识透人心。啊。。。坏到极处。）
老想去看妈妈了。但神是嫉妒的神。我不敢过分。Apr 2, 2021 12:34:02 PM，想着弄个卡，这样随时有网可以联上云端，去看妈妈也不耽误学习。然后想到，这样太依赖妈妈，上帝会嫉妒吧，然后我俩就完蛋了。。。偶像和崇拜者都得打碎。这是被动的。
主动的就是，人心比万物都诡诈。看看自己的心不就知道了嘛。她的心也是如此。比万物都诡诈。一切都是神保守着，才有点可看的样子。唉。勉强维持点可看的样子。全是神恩典的样子。确实美好。神恩典的样子。那还不追求神啊？你以为你是被人吸引了？屁。是被其身上的一点点神恩典的样子吸引了。去追求神啊！我要追求神。完全的神恩典的样子。
人呐，都是嘴上叫的再响亮，一旦用脚投票的时候，跑得比谁都快的人。

可怜他吗？亚伯拉罕为什么不可怜大财主，没有良心吗？亚伯拉罕看到的，是他现在的苦难，也是他曾经的享福。他看到全部了，在他的话里，一切都很合适。公义，与怜悯。怜悯，与公义。Apr 2, 2021 12:56:02 PM，看到有个前期为了钱，后期受苦的。唉呀。得看到全部才行。公义先行筛选，怜悯随后恩典。是吗？大卫呢？也是先心。嗯。公义审判他。怜悯恩待他。大卫的后裔，多大的恩典。对大卫的。

主耶稣没有犯过罪，却为我们经历十字架的痛苦。
耶稣在十字架上最痛苦的就是他说这句话的时候。他因我们的罪恶被抛弃了。
因着耶稣的十字架，我们得与神关系和好。我们的荣耀是什么呢。我们夸奖的是什么呢。是我们自己吗？是耶稣的十字架。

福音的核心是十字架的救恩。这是我们信仰的实质。不是十字架的装饰，乃是耶稣基督的救赎。

我们最美的盼望是他为我们升天还要为我们再来接我们与他永远同住。

真正的信仰，必然有内在的更新带来外在的改变。

十字架是我们的荣耀。我们因此有平安有盼望。

我们在神面前，我们所有能拿的出来的，都一文不值。我们都需要神的怜悯。

既然是领受者，我们所能夸的，是赐给我们这一切的那一位。这是我们最感恩的事情。

能考好吗？考不好也无所谓了。反正我已经能读圣经了。够用了够用了。够到永永远远的。赚大了。不对，恩典大上天了～～～Apr 2, 2021 8:24:35 PM，听道中，想到要申请以色列或天安，想到我英语能考好吗？然后想到我能读圣经听圣经，那托福考好考不好无所谓了。大不了回去读圣经。啊。期待。我期待读圣经。每天读，还是每天期待～～～

我的alt3的自己写的长篇，为什么看的也是和听到的不一样呢？因为我知道，我看到的是修正前的。我听到的是修正后的。所以让我知道我哪里错了，根据我听到的，下次写的时候就知道了。Fri 02 Apr 2021 09:27:57 PM KST ，正在修正自己写的东西中。唉呀。语法错误词汇错误真多。然后用修正后的录音，用修正前的作为文本。这样的来使我看到错的，我就学习了。当然也可以把修正后的放上作为文本看，但，不就不能知道哪里错了嘛。。。这样，看到的和听到的不一样，根据哪个是修正后的，来对比，来学习，来使自己再次写的时候，警戒，改正。从而正确的去写。嗯。。。
但那错的，也不算大事。只是会稍微扣点分。生活中嘛，大家都明白意思。啊～～～主啊，求你救我。

아들이 엄마 아빠의 사랑을 간증했어요. 꿈에서 하는 것이지만...

아빠는 아들때문에 엄마에게 관심을 더 많이 주고, 엄마는 아들때문에 아빠의 사랑을 더 많이 생각하는 것은, 바로 아들의 쓸모라고 생각한다.

전화번호는 필요없어요. 내가 갈 수 있으니까.

필요할 때, 불러주세요. 내가 성천교회에서 은혜를 많이 받거든요.

3년동안 엠마오에 있어서 돈 안내고 공부하고 자고 먹고 하는 것은 큰 은혜에요.

이제 수업을 받아야 돼요. 필요하면 이번주 금요일에 또 갈게요. 아무튼 내가 은혜를 너무 많이 받아서요.

오후에 내가 마트에 가서 먹을 것 좀 사야 돼요. 금요일에 가면 내일 모래의 것 사면 돼요. 아니면 이번주 먹을 것 사요. 그래서 엄마가 결정하세요.

아니요, 선교사님께서 결정하세요.

네. 알겠습니다. 다음주 금요일에 만나자.

우리 엄마, 이제 제가 나가서 마트에 갈래요. 교실에 지나고 아이패드를 교실에 놔둘래요.

네. 다음주 금요일까지 먹을 수 있는 것 사왔어요.

교실에 왔어 아이패드로 메모해야 돼서 아이패드를 켤 수 있어요.

그리고 내 고향집 하고 자주 연락하지 마세요. 나 자신도 자주 연락하지 않는데요.

지금 엄청 졸려요. 수업 빨리 끝나면 좋겠어요.

내일 엄마의 시무일이니까 오늘 잘 쉬세요.

내 아들.수업중에 졸리다고 카톡하고 수업에 집중하지 않구나.

엄마는 어제 목사님들 모임에 참석하고 주방 봉사는 면했다

오늘은 새벽기도 끝나고 실컷 잤다

지금은 빨래하고 부엌에 설거지를 하려한다

교수님이 말씀하신 것 재미없어서 엄마의 생각을 좀 해야 돼요.

내일 기대되네요. 우리 엄마 하나님 아버지의 일에 참여하는 것은 영광입니다.

특별한것 없다. 그냥 평상시와 같이 하면 돼.

응. 우리 엄마의 평상시라도 하나님 아버지를 위해 살아있는 삶입니다.

목사님 밭에 왔다.엄마도 나가 본다.(미소)

이제 수업끝나고 돌아가야 돼요. 아이패드를 교실에 놔둬요. 낮에만 엄마와 연락해요. 밤에는 우리 주님안에서 안식해야 돼요.









오늘 점심 우리가 김밥을 만들고 먹었어요. 그리고 내가 밥솥 없기 때문에 남은 두개 김밥과 쌀밥을 조금 담아갔어요. 

쌀밥을 담은 봉지없어서 그래서 냄비로 담고 나갔어요. 엘리베이터앞에 누나들을 만났어요. 거지와 같다고 했어요. 내가 휴지로 냄비를 덮으려고 해서 화장실에 갔어요. 나와서 엘리베이터로 가고 엘리베이터 앞에 가게 될 때, 엘리베이터의 문의 틈이 천천히 닫히고 내려갔어요. 

처음 당한 일이 아니라서 그래서 그저 친구의 냉담함으로 생각해요. 좀 이따가 "거지와 같다"는 말이 생각났어요. "나와 같이 있으면 그들의 체면을 깎을 수 있다"는 생각이 들어왔어요. 그러군요. 
자세히 생각해 보니까, 우리 엄마도 내 너덜너덜하는 가방이나 신발을 안 좋아요. 엄마의 체면을 깎을 수 있어요. 이렇게 창피한 나를 누구든지 혐오해요. 

나를 혐오하는 것은 같지만 창피한 내게 대한 반응이 완전히 달라요. 
그들이 창피한 나를 버리고 우리 엄마는 내 창피한 것을 바꿔주셨어요. 

이 돈이 주장하는 세상에서 누구나 돈을 따라가요. 돈이 없는 자는 예수님이라도 그들이 혐오해요. 
마태복음서 25-40 ... 내 형제 중에 지극히 작은 자 하나에게 한 것이 곧 내게 한 것이니라
마태복음서 25-45 ... 이 지극히 작은 자 하나에게 하지 아니한 것이 곧 내게 하지 아니한 것이니라

메시아를 기다리는 이스라엘 사람들이 그들이 기대하는 메시아를 죽일 수 있는 것 같이, 오늘도 예수님을 사랑하는 자들이 그들이 믿고 사랑하는 예수님을 혐오할 수 있는 것이에요. 
아마 예수님을 믿는 부한 그들의 생각에는 예수님이 주릴 수 없고, 목마를 수 없으며, 벗을 수 없고 병들 수 없으며, 옥에 갇힐 수도 없는 것 같아요. 그들이 이렇게 잘 사는데 그들이 믿는 예수님이 당연히 그들보다 더 잘 살아야 돼요. 예수님이 저렇게 처참하게 지낼 리가 없어요. 

예수님이 우리를 위해 고난을 당해서야 우리가 오늘처럼 행복하게 살 수 있어요. 
그리고 우리가 고난 당한 예수님을 혐오해요. 왜 이렇게 창피하냐고 싫어해요. 우리는 볼 수 없는 고난 당하고 창피한 주님을 "주여 주여" 힘세게 외쳐요. 볼 수 있는 창피한 자를 싫어해요. 우리에게 있는 행복함은 다 주님의 고난이에요. 고난 당하신 주님께 감사해요. 고난주간 우리가 주님의 고난을 기억해요. 

우리가 믿고 또 사랑하는 메시아는 바로 이스라엘 사람들이 기대하는 메시아에요. 우리가 기대하는 메시아를 만날 때도 이스라엘 백성처럼 반응해요. 
우리의 도움이 필요하는 예수님을 우리가 어떻게 사랑해요? 우리보다 더 못한 예수님을 우리가 어떻게 사랑할 수 있어요? 예수님이 일단 재물의 힘을 빌리고 재물로 자기를 치장한 후에야 우리가 그분을 사랑할 수 있어요. 

누가 화려한 성전을 안 좋아해요? 누가 초라한 구유를 좋아할 수 있어요? 생색을 낼 수 있는 화려한 성전이 당연히 창피한 구유보다 더 좋아요. 
구유에 누워있는 구주님이 진짜로 창피해요. 우리의 체면을 깎을 수 밖에 없어요. 그분이 그의 왕위에 올라간 후 우리가 그분을 사랑해요. 다행이 오늘날에 예수님이 이미 그의 왕위에 올라갔어요. 우리가 우리 왕이신 예수님을 사랑해요. 

왕위 아닌 구유에 누워있는 예수님이 누가 좋아요? 영광아닌 너덜너덜한 옷을, 아니, 강보를 입은 예수님이 누가 좋아요? 우리가 왜 외모적으로 예수님을 판단해요? 심지어 우리가 그분을 십자가위에 죽였어요. 우리의 체면을 깎는 예수. 
예수님과 동행하는 것은 우리의 체면을 깎을 수 있으면 우리가 예수님을 피할 수 밖에 없어요. 우리가 보기에 아주 못된 예수님을 사랑할 수 있는 자가 어디 있겠어요? 

요한계시록 1-7 볼찌어다 구름을 타고 오시리라 각인의 눈이 그를 보겠고 그를 찌른 자들도 볼터이요 
이 예언이 오늘날까지 이루어지지 않아요. 예수님이 죽으신지 거의 2000년이 되어지만 이 영광스러운 강림이 아직도 없어요. 

창피한 자를 혐오하는 사람은 두가지 반응이 있어요. 피하는 것과 도와주는 것. 
내가는 창피한 자와 같이 창피한 자가 되기를 원해요. 내가 예수님이 창피한 자가 아닌 것을 믿어요. 아무리 창피해 보여도. 

로마서 9-33 ... 저를 믿는 자는 부끄러움을 당치 아니하리라 ...
내가 그의 말을 믿습니다. 그분이 내 부끄러움을 벗어주실 그 날이 오시길 원해요. 

그분의 부끄러움에 참여하는 자들이 그분이 영광중에 강림하시는 날을 소망해요. 
창피한 그분이 영광스러운 하나님의 아들이라는 것을 내가 믿어요. 지금 창피한 내 주님이 빨리 영광스러운 자가 되기를 원해요. 

창피한 요셉이 영광스러운 자 된 것 같이 창피한 내 주님이 영광스러운 자가 될 수 있는 줄 믿어요. 
내가 원하는 것은 그저 그 날이 빨리 오신 것이에요. 빨리하는 것은 없어요. 다행히 더디하는 것도 없어요. 

이 세상에서 사는 동안 주님의 날을 소망하면서 살아갈 수 있기를 원해요. 주님의 날이 오시길 기대해요. 








Summary of chapter four: WenZhou, walk through the churches' remains in China mainland's Jerusalem. 

WenZhou is a special city which was specialized with Christianity culture. The first missionary of WenZhou was Josiah Alexander Jackson and George Stott, they came to WenZhou and started their missions in November, 1867. Stott became a Protestant believer when he was in a hospital, because of his maimed left leg. He decided to become a missionary of China when he got to know the necessity of preaching the gospel in China. Stott built the first Christian church of WenZhou on April 1, 1877, moreover Stott and his wife built the first women's school in WenZhou. 

The first Methodist Church of WenZhou was built by pastor R. Inkermann Exly in 1878. After pastor Inkermann, William Edward Soothill and his wife came to WenZhou in November, 1883, and did great things for WenZhou, even for China. 

Soothill played a great role in the process of making WenZhou to be China's Jerusalem. Soothill arrived at WenZhou when he was 22 years old, with his flancee Lucy Farrar Soothill, after they came into WenZhou, they studied WenZhou language for 6 months, and then they preached the Gospel. Soothill and his wife had done many things for WenZhou, but they were attacked in a anti-Christianity movement on October 4, 1884. When he and his 30 believers were worshiping, a part of mobs intruded into his worship place and started to throw stones, the mobs destroyed his house, his school, and his churches. 

To restore his hospital Soothill invited many physicians, a man named John Ding Ley came to WenZhou and built the DingLey Hospital. DingLey Hospital was the first western hospital, and the name was changed to BaiLeiDe Hospital in 1906, and the name was changed again in 1949 to WenZhou Second Hospital. 

In 1893, Soothill translated the New Testament with WenZhou language, he built the first high school in the autumn of the same year, his wife built a woman's high school in 1905. In 1911, Soothill asked for support to build a college when he went back to England, but his plan was broken due to the first world war from 1914 to 1918. But his wife built a woman's middle school in Beijing. Soothill became a professor of Chinese Culture in Oxford in 1920, and wrote many books about Chinese culture. Soothill died on May 14, 1935, in Oxford, and was buried in Oxford, he had lived in WenZhou for 25 years, and built more than 150 churches, and preached Jesus to more than 10,000 people. His life was devoted to WenZhou and China thoroughly. 

After Soothill finished his work in 1911 and returned to England, J. W. Heywood pastor continued his work. He proclaimed that the Chinese Church should support itself, and he got much support from the immediate areas. He encouraged believers to have their religious life, furthermore, he stressed the financial foundation and worker cultivation. In this period, WenZhou's churches grew quickly. 

After pastor Soothill and Heywood, the head pastor of ChongXiTang is the missionary Scott, and after Scott went back to England, Pastor W. B. Ayoltt continued their work. In August, 1936, "Christianity κοινωνια", also called "Oxford κοινωνια" , started in ChongXiTang. Moreover, they started religious education for believers. But in 1958, the China government decided to expand the Three-self patriotic movement and want to make all China churches to be the same one under the same rule, same system, and same institution. 

With the Great Cultural Revolution, ChongXiTang was destroyed, and the leaders of churches were criticized, the activities of churches were forbidden. However, after the Great Culture Revolution, the number of Christian in WenZhou recovered to an amazing size. Although WenZhou churches have their own problems such as they are a small part just for WenZhou people, the effect of WenZhou churches affected the whole China mainland. As WenZhou was called China's Jerusalem, the people of WenZhou were called China's Jews. The mode of WenZhou churches were studied throughout the China mainland. 

I have gone to WenZhou twice before I came to Korea, what I have seen in WenZhou churches made me amazed when I first went to WenZhou. Different from my hometown's church, WenZhou's church is more shining, and their sermon talked about money offering openly. I think that's the secret of WenZhou churches' success. As their nickname, "China's Jews", they grasp God and money together, they serve God more by their money, and they get more money by their religion. I have to mention that when I went to WenZhou to study there for 2 weeks, I paid nothing even a penny. 

The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard, it grows and it will be greater than the herbs. All things of this world are counted as nothing but refuse, however, the tree of the Kingdom of Heaven needs the garbage to grow. Our purpose is not the garbage, however our purpose, the tree of the Kingdom of Heaven needs to grow. I don't know WenZhou believers' attitude about money and God, but I know that God doesn't see our outside, but our inside, our heart. Serving God by money, or serving money by God, one hand grasp money, another hand grasp God, are the same things from outside, but only God knows our hearts. There must be enough garbage for the tree of the Heavenly Kingdom, but our purpose is not garbage but the Kingdom of Heaven. All of the world will pass away, but our God lives forever and ever.

With the Great Cultural Revolution, ChongXiTang was destroyed, and the leaders of churches were criticized, the activities of churches were forbidden. However, after the Great Culture Revelution, the number of Christian in WenZhou recovered to an amazing size. Although WenZhou churches have their own problems such as they are small part just for WenZhou people, the effect of WenZhou churches affected the whole China mainland. As WenZhou was called China's Jerusalem, the people of WenZhou were called China's Jews. The mode of WenZhou churches were studied through out the China mainland. 

I have had went to WenZhou twice before I came to Korea, what I have seen in WenZhou churches made me amazed when I first went to WenZhou. Different with my hometown's church, WenZhou's church is more shining, and their sermon talked about money offering openly. I think that's the secret of WenZhou churches' success. As their nickname, "China's Jews", they grasp God and money together, they serve God more by their money, and they get more money by their religion. I have to mentioned that when I went to WenZhou to study there for 2 weeks, I payed nothing even a penny. 

The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard, it grows and it will be greater than the herbs. All things of this world is counted as nothing but refuse, however, the tree of the Kingdom of Heaven need refuse to grow. Our purpose is not the refuse, however our purpose, the tree of the Kingdom of Heaven need to grow. I don't know what's WenZhou believers' attitude about money and God, but I know that God doesn't see our outside, but our inside, our heart. Serving God by money, or serving money by God, one hand grasp money, another hand grasp God, are the same things in outside, but only God know our hearts. There must be enough refuse for the tree of Heavenly Kingdom, but our purpose is not refuse but the Kingdom of Heaven. All of the world will pass away, but our God lives forever and ever.

Revised:___________________

Today is Friday, the class is professor Chon’s. Our professor came a little late, so I contacted my mom before the class started. I wanted to go to the place where my mom lives, and she replied to me a little late, so I worried about this for a while.

When we were waiting for our professor, my mom replied and let me go to her place, I said nothing but YES, I will go. My mom asked me whether I have enough money to see her, and I told her that I have money to go. When we were talking, our professor came into our class room, to avoid strange facial expressions. I said to mom to have a video talking after our class finished.

The Holy spirit is called cleaning spirit, who is cleaning our spirit.

The word of the Lord can remove weeds of our heartland. We need to repent and remember the word of God in our heart.

But we don’t like to receive the word of God because of our evil things in heart, which will be attacked by the word of God, and let our heart become a battlefield, which makes us suffer. However our Father is our King, he must rule over our heart, he will kill all enemies in our heart. He reigns forever and ever, he is our King, our Father.

The changing of our heart will lead us to a new life.

Some of us tug at the rules so hard that we never soar to reach the heights we might have obtained. It’s not our will, like the walls of the kingdom of heaven is not built by us, that the grace of God, we live in there not by ourselves but by the irresistible power of God. Moreover, we are willing to live there, it’s limited, but we live in the light of God freely. Thank you for keeping us by your irresistible rules when we are deceived to destroy ourselves. Thank you, tug at the rules, to give me freedom in your limitations. The limitation of your kingdom of heaven is my keeper, keep me safe in your home.

Sacred and Secular, the theory of Augustine.

I want to go to the toilet, to get happy from my body pressure, however it’s not the time for my body to be happy, but it’s the time for the class. God will give me the time for the toilet, for he is mercy, even to a cattle.

God’s Sovereignty and God’s Glory are two important points that we shall remember.

The Christian View of God and the World, is the book of James Orr.

Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should meet Jesus Christ tomorrow.





The contradiction between God and his agent, first is that there are contradictions between them, second is that although there are contradictions between them we shall respect God’s agents as God, God’s agents only be judged by God, third is two attitudes to face God’s agents, obey like the widow, or escape like David.

We discussed above mentioned questions from the problem of  offering gifts to God in the Sunday morning, March 28, 2021, I cited the window who obeyed God’s agents and offered her all money, the King David who escaped from God’s agents who wanted to kill him, the son of Samuel who were rejected by Israelites, however God thinks not his agents but himself was rejected by Israelites.

After that I fetched all of my money from my purse, all of these are small money, maybe all of these can become a big money, and said “I will give out all of I have, obeyed the agent’s of God.” Then my mom said, “Who covet your small money?” I replied, “The money of the widow was just two very small brass coins, who covet her money? But Jesus said those scribes devour widow’s houses. Are they robbers? No, they are agents of God, the scribes, the leaders of religion.” And I counted those small money in the offering envelope just now, and I found that it is exactly one big money.

How can those scribes devour the widow’s houses? By which way they can devour the widow’s houses? From the context we can only find that the widow offered all that she  had to live on. God devoured her house? Jesus admired her because of her offering, and who will receive those offerings? Not Jesus, and Jesus rebuked those scribes, saying they devour widows’ houses. The widow was taught by the agents of God, and offered all of her to God, but must through the agent’s of God, God admired the widow, but rebuked his agents. There are contradictions between God and his agents, from the Old Testament until the New Testament, and there is no one can be a perfect agent of God, so God gave us his only one Son, only on him can we rely.








Today is Tuesday, our professor came late, and before class my sister asked me about Hebrew participle, I found the summary of our Hebrew class, and showed her the summary and tried to interpret it, then our professor came into our class room, we have not finished our interpretation yet. However God is good. 

The five blessings of Abraham, Nation, Name, Land, Relation, and Blessing. 

God’s names are revelation. Accommodation of God, God in the form of human, the word is “Anthropomorphism.” 

The description of God includes the aspects of human, such as body, emotion, actions, professions, and some things, such as some animals, and stone. 

We call God our Father, but the word “Father” can’t describe the whole God, we can use many things to describe God, but there is no one who can describe the whole God, this is the difference between God and his creation. Thus, the thesis of “Anthropomorphism” has it’s limitations. 

Pantheism said God is the world, but the Bible said that God surpasses the whole world. 

The four points of Glory, first is essence, “glory” in Hebrew means heavy; second is radiant; third is salvation, all of his creation express his glory, but they were crusted because of sins, and salvation is the way to glorify God;  fourth is imitation, we are the image of God, if we imitate God, we glorify God. 

I shouldn’t ask “Do we have meat” because there is a verse said about such people as a bad friend to associate with. Proverbs 23-20 Don’t be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge themselves on meat. 

Gorge means overeat or eat immodestly; make a pig of oneself. Immodestly means not modest. Modest means having a humble opinion of yourself. 

Ectypal theology, first means our knowledge of God comes from God; second means God’s accommodation; third means similitude, similitude means similarity in appearance or character or nature between persons or things; fourth means believable of God, God let person become believer. 

Divine repentance is the repentance of God, different from the repentance of humans. 

The names of God express his essence and attributes. 

Divine simplicity, means God’s being, God’s essence, God’s attributes, are the same, because God is Spirit. 

The professor is telling the story of a “blind touch elephant,” and this makes me think of the first year of my Kosin life, I said the same thing, but they disdained me. Maybe they don’t agree with the professor, like they don't agree with me, but because of his status or position, they can’t disdain him but just listen or agree. Maybe they agreed with me in 2019 when I was saying the same thing, but they must disdain me, because of my status and position. We don’t disdain things or words, but disdain the one who said it or made it. Things can’t receive any disdain. 

When Israelites were rejecting the sons of Samuel, God thinks they rejected him. Disdaining someone’s words or things, it’s not disdaining the words or things, but the one. 

Israel is the nation of God, Israelites are the people of God, and especially, those who rejected the sons of Samuel are the elders of Israel. The conclusion is: “If someone disdains me, it’s disdaining me, if someone doesn’t disdain me, he is superior over me, he has such a qualification to disdain me.” 






Hebrews 1-11 They will perish, but you continue. They all will grow old like a garment does.

Today is Wednesday,  the class is professor Kim’s, when I was watching our professor, I thought of a word, “The warrior killed the dragon and became the new dragon”. And then I think of the above one verse, we are a new religion, but we have grown old now. Not only religion, but everything, even the whole world, they all will grow old like a garment does. But our Lord will continue forever and ever. 

The impending judgment in the book of Amos,  and the synthetic chart of Amos. 

Prosecution of the nations. The prosecutor is the chief legal representative of the prosecution in countries with either the common law adversarial system, or the civil law inquisitorial system. The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case in a criminal trial against an individual accused of breaking the law.

Three judgment speeches and two woe Oracles. Woe means misery resulting from affliction. Oracle means an authoritative person who divines the future, a prophecy, usually obscure or allegorical, revealed by a priest or priestess; believed to be infallible. 

Amos 3-3 Do two walk together, unless they have agreed? The Chinese version of this verse is “They can’t walk together, unless they have the same heart”. 

Amos 3-7 Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing, unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets. This verse reminds me of the way of God’s working. The agent of God has more meanings for me than before. 

Three messages of accusation and judgement. A clean conscience fears not false accusations.

Amos 6-5 who strum on the strings of a harp; who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David; I should watch my heart carefully, although there are instruments like David’s, but the heart of David is different with them. 

Vision of Plumb Line, Plumb means to measure the depth of something, as a noun means the metal bob of a plumb line. Bob means the former monetary unit in Great Britain. 

Not suppression but Freedom, Not Scapegoating but Responsibility, Not Ignoring but Advocacy, Not Stinginess but Generosity. 

Amos 7-3 Yahweh relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” says Yahweh. The repentance of God means he is mercy and doesn't give us the disasters that we deserve. 

Amos 5-4 For Yahweh says to the house of Israel: “Seek me, and you will live; Amos 5-24 But let justice roll on like rivers, and righteousness like a mighty stream. The Key Verses of Amos. 

Leviticus 16-8 Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats; one lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for the scapegoat. 

The word responsibility starts with the word response, someone responding quickly has a strong responsibility, says our professor. 

Our professor asked me a Hebrew word, and I answered it, then I got to be proud, I’m so small, so light, so I can’t bear any glory now. Thank God not giving me any glory, because I can’t bear it, but maybe hurt by it. Until I have the life of an elder, who knows to give glory to God. 

Our professor asked me another Hebrew word, and I don’t know it, thank God let me know how ignorant I am. Only God gives me some knowledge, can I have some knowledge. Gloria in excelsis Deo. 

In 1517, the religion reformation started from Luther. 

Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. 

What religious denomination does he belong to?

Quaker means a member of the Religious Society of Friends founded by George Fox, the Friends have never called themselves Quakers. Or means one who quakes and trembles with fear. The word Earthquake, the earth is quaking.
