脱光衣服的不知道什么玩意的怪物掌控的时候真是危险啊。如果二者都是，那真是，数次在地狱悬崖的边缘游荡啊。差点就完蛋了。安全的活在天堂不好吗。不要刺激不要刺激。要平安安息平安安息。2021/04/23 00:36，想到去看望妈妈隔离时最后半天出来的时候啊，真是，神真的大大的保守了啊。从一开始的动机开始了保守：只是要皮肤接触下增进亲情要素。定了个点。但还是，太危险了。
其实这样的有数次，一次在学校二楼，一次在小姨家，唉呀，简直太危险了。神啊，天父啊，太感谢你了。你怜悯了我。没有让恶玩意得逞，不然，呵，她只是失去了个小负担，我可失去了个教养者妈妈啊。再造之恩啊。谢谢天父怜悯了我。主啊，往后，我要住在你的永恒不变的天国的平安之中。天堂，天堂。平安，安息。我要昼夜祷告侍奉你。哈利路亚～～～穿着衣服，早祷回来的，妈妈，儿子，太好了～～～永永远远，在你家里。感谢你。
世越号，沉了很多旅行的学生。唉。主啊，我抱怨我不能像他们一样有资源享受，但，啊，我怎么能知道你的保守的恩典啊。我是那样的愚昧无知。但你是爱，谢谢你的保守。我要住在你的保守之中。永永远远。2021/04/23 13:53，上课听到关于7年前世越号沉沦的话题。主啊，求你怜悯你的儿女。耶稣救我。

你打一首歌吧。傻逼的我。。。2021/04/23 14:19，看 infinity of sound ，有打鼓的嘛，想到一开始我的傻逼。唉呀。我也是这么傻逼过来的，算了。。。我在耶稣面前不说话了，仰望耶稣。

感谢天父，赐给我肚子疼保护我不顺从肉体的情欲而行。2021/04/24 04:52，在成天教会宣教馆，醒来了想着去找妈妈，因为肚子疼，没有多少想法，想休息。。。感谢神。
我要安息。在我主里面。
孩子一般吃饱了就睡的。嗯。这就去睡觉去。0600，睡了一会，想着还是得接触下，想着亲情的皮肤接触，还有奶。嗯。有奶可吃会满足。就去了。亲切会，吃个奶，就满足了，不再不满了。然后如此对话。真好～～～（不过谨慎，连恶姿势都不要有。谨慎。害怕。敬畏。姿态表现内心啊。不要向恶。要向好的
愿她的养育，再造我，成为王子。我要纪念我所受到的王子的养育。
就算喜欢我，爱我，也不能把我的丢人常常的提啊。2021/04/24 23:27，今天妈妈给我洗澡，我不小心出来了一截屎。如果对方经常提，就算她爱我喜爱我，我也不高兴。不要这样提。不要提了。有很多好的可以提。嗯。
就提那些喜爱我爱我的，就够了。提不完的。真好。神啊，耶稣救我。
随着我对弟兄，对辛苦劳作的弟兄，有调侃的时候，神的使者就生气愤怒了。2021/04/25 08:29，早上调侃喷药的弟兄说女士就是好，他都不来二楼了。
我得意？的丑态却自以为帅啊，神的宣教士就开始教训我了。说教会各人有各人的岗位，大家站好自己的岗位，就能把教会运作起来。嗯。然后又告诉我察颜观色。（我这偶尔来一次，宣教士说别人会不满，其实别人没表现。只是你而已。其实人又能对谁满意呢。）（我起晚了。错了。来这儿，错了。早上讲那个梦刺激到你了让你觉得自己是为了钱来这里的？）（你早起就来我这磨磨唧唧的早起有用吗。我这说你你就这样带着刺。你这样不和人接触能怎样。我这带着你，如果你这样，以后就什么都不说了。）（我先记下来。太多了，我得记下来，慢慢的消化的说。）（确实。我应该学习怎样下跪。因为神没有把我弄成高富帅，那我应该学习下跪的姿势。除非，我不想和他们玩了。就是，不和人接触了。否则，我需要学习下跪的姿势，和神所设立的王和王子们一起玩。其实对我有好处，就是将来，这样会下跪，还会永远下跪的人，跪在神面前的人，才能永永远远的侍奉他。永永远远的敬拜他。伏俯敬拜独一真神。）
面对人的时候，要予以能给予的热情。2021/04/25 08:52，出去本堂楼下上厕所，门口遇见正上楼的宣教士，就热情招呼，请进宣教士。然后后面跟着上来的拿着周报分发的人，我就那样不说话了。唉呀。我能同样的给予热情的啊。我这。唉。。。
耶稣救我。因我在这地上，甚是茫然。求你引导我。（后续：08:56，上完厕所上楼了，正好分发周报的弟兄在周报旁边，周报一个个叠的整齐，付出的弟兄太让人感动了。拿了个周报，从心里到口里说出热情的 감사합니다. 对方也是，立刻笑脸绽放。啊。神啊，那是你的光，在他的脸上，照亮。）
她对他热情过。转为了冷漠。她对我热情过，转为了冷漠，加上控告。我得断奶了。下一个她热情的对象是谁呢？但愿她回到她起初的热情。2021/04/25 09:06，想到今天早上的冷漠控告的对话，嗯，她对他那么冷漠对我如此热情或者对我如此冷漠对他如此热情，唉，人心比万物都诡诈。人的热情比粪土，不是，是和粪土一个价值的'热'情。。。我的下一个热情的对象是谁呢？我的热情的对象的热情的对象又是谁呢？
今天得回去了。最近吃的太多，消化不好。得回去慢慢的消化消化才行。
我果然还是适合跪着。上帝啊，你怎么对待我都行了。2021/04/25 09:15，看着高富帅，想着我这不是，就得学习怎么跪着，心里难受，对神的教会亦有不满，想着拆毁重建，为什么不立刻马上？为什么不顺应我心里的怒气？啊。。。想想我得跪着了。我这样应该跪着的人，不跪着，那是，不会有跪着的心态。。。明明是要跪着的现实，我却姿态心态都不跪着，是会产生冲突的。
然后一跪下，啊，心里的不满，怒气，全都没有了。主啊，你怎么对待我都行。嗯。乞丐也罢，打压也罢，剥削也罢，都行。你随意。愿你旨意成就。至于别人，主啊，我跪着呢，你想怎样都行。主啊，我跪着呢。我要永永远远，在你面前，跪着。
我跪着呢。神啊，求你救我。2021/04/25 09:20，又跪着祷告了一会，感觉好无奈，神啊，我跪着呢，你却放了个金佛像在我面前的感觉。神啊，我跪着呢，求你救我。
我们都跪着呢。忽然明白了。有两个相反的方向，神和吗们，而我们人，都跪着呢。我们都跪着呢。神怎样对我们都行的。有的人，神任吗们吸引他们。有的人，神让吗门拒绝他们排斥他们。神啊，求你吸引我，拯救我。求你在我身上放上吗门排斥的东西。求你吸引我，拯救我。求你使我跪着的方向朝向你。神啊，我主啊，耶稣基督啊，我跪着呢。求你救我。耶稣救我。
下午礼拜完就出发，牧师让我去世界路教会呢。我不一定去那个教会。但牧师对我来他们教会的态度也是可想而知的。我也体验过她的冷漠了，而且，她对我冷漠，能加上控告。没错，在神面前。确实是。还好，神确实保守了我，她控告也控告不了太多。只能一点点。（那我不要她的教导了吗？那可能让我做点事有功。但她一个控告，我所有的功，全都归于空。并且，还要被定罪，甚至下监狱。她和我合作些能控告我的事情，反正她没有损失。但我和她合作这些事情，是没有收获的除了欺骗，可是，反手她就可以控告我让我下监狱。啊。洁身自好，是个保命的好习惯啊。神啊，谢谢你救了我的生命。）2021/04/25 09:38，想着下午走的逻辑。
那么以后，想来这教会的时候，就去世界路教会吧。啊。功劳已经足够大。看神给你的奖赏吧。
神救了我，从我那张狂的罪恶之中。神拯救了我。2021/04/25 09:53，圣歌中呢，想到昨天一起洗澡时我充血张狂的罪恶，啊。神拯救了我。而且这样看，她控告我是合适的。因为确实，我张狂的罪恶，怎么控告都是合适的。
但感谢神。神拯救了我脱离了罪恶。通过他的使者。而且，神拯救了我脱离了审判。借着他的使者，怜悯了我。主啊，谢谢你我的神。我要归向你我的神。
维基词典真好看。看了之后，缓解了我站久了被强迫跪下的怨气。。。2021/04/25 10:27，聚会中，有个孩子不喜欢听牧师讲道，开始自己的活动，我也是，一直在自己的活动。但大孩子了，就注意了下不打扰别人。嗯。。。然后看维基字典，wiktionary，啊，各样的知识，都是我不懂的啊。真多啊。各种的语源学知识，相关的知识，从古至今啊。遍历历史啊。我的怨气也没了。想着在妈妈这儿呆到明天也行吧。嗯。。。
想想那个孩子，不喜欢听，就开始自己的活动就得了。干嘛要表现出敌意的离开呢。。。那个孩子开始着自己的活动，仍然呆在教会中，呆在妈妈身边，愿意和人一起呆的。啊。。。可以进行着自己的活动嘛。。。
所有的准备工作，都是他干的。为了省钱连人都不雇都自己干自己辛苦，还没有啥奖励。他不仅找人发免费员工，他连自己都当成免费员工，更狠的那种。2021/04/25 10:50，看着院长在台上，想到昨天，嗯，一直是他自己在准备宣教的工作，各种奔跑，各种劳碌，啊，没有人帮他。其他人都是来讲个义就行了。他自己辛苦奔跑劳碌。啊。为了给教会省钱，他是各样的劳碌啊。明明雇人报销就行的。为了教会啊。。。教会不知道神下一任要交给谁的说。。。
【传2:18】我恨恶一切的劳碌，就是我在日光之下的劳碌，因为我得来的必留给我以后的人。【传2:19】那人是智慧，是愚昧，谁能知道？他竟要管理我劳碌所得的，就是我在日光之下用智慧所得的。这也是虚空。
男人是打怪的，打怪得经验和装备，然后都给了女人，让女人参加pvp活动。。。2021/04/25 11:08，小崔和她丈夫来了，然后妈妈和小崔聊天。两个男的一个沉默，一个打字。。。唉。。。pvp无能者。。。啊。。。

金宣教士和沈牧师，是一样的人啊。就是，把自己当成免费员工为他人服务的人。2021/04/25 12:45，中午一起吃饭，金宣教士买的食材，金宣教士处理的，给大家一起吃。啊。。。
想到了沈院长昨天干活，也是，沈院长自己买的设备，好吧，教会，但他完全可以通过各种方法给自己，而且按公司看，都是他的。他的教会买的设备，他处理的，给大家一起用。啊。。。（我能参与其中，真是神的恩典啊。）（不过他们都是把自己当免费员工来使的。我也要注意啊。有这心态才行啊。为神的百姓服务。）（得什么？神永生之道，还满足不了你吗？再说了，你，又是什么呢？神造的，为神而用，为神而存在，神也是把自己当成免费的员工啊。造出我们又能得什么回报呢。我们的存在，是神多么大的工作的恩典啊。）
好像自己真的多单纯一样。2021/04/25 13:00，想到包饺子的时候。我的饺子包的。唉呀。。。我真是常常自义啊。感谢神的使者。
我已经过了单纯的年龄了。仍然保持单纯的心，假装自己没有老，唉呀，主啊救我。（还好，主使我遇到一个单纯的人。妈妈是个单纯的，遵守规则，持守信仰，单纯规矩的人。）
不要快速判断。不要判断。因为，神要做最后的判断。2021/04/25 13:47，下午去教堂，然后出去遇见个车停在正中间，想着是谁呢。然后看见一个拄着双拐的姊妹慢慢的移动着。主啊，求你赦免我无知而起的恶意。主啊，求你可怜我的无知。主啊，求你拯救我们。拯救我们肉体的疾病，拯救我们属灵的无知。主啊，求你拯救我们。

他的尴尬他都知道。唉。。。他也。不说免得自己尴尬。2021/04/25 14:37，牧师讲到我说他都自己干吗得大家一起干啊。讲到电脑店老板让他带个年轻人他就心里寻思大家都忙着上班哪有年轻人有时间啊，但没好意思说出口。所以我这不上班陪他，就尴尬了吧。。。唉。。。
但也是，如果我也是上班，好吧，专注于世上的事，在玛门的评价里能被高看。但在神的评价里呢。唉。。。主里的人有时会用玛门评判。好吧，从初代教会开始如此。。。
他想让崔执事和其丈夫出席自己教会，就夸奖了崔执事怎样怎样的，又说有了她多好多好的。啊。厉害的人。。。2021/04/25 15:11，听牧师夸来教会看金宣教士的崔执事。。。
渣男。老婆就是这样被骗来成了个廉价雇员感觉。。。但大卫不也是嘛感觉。。。不懂了。。。好吧。我这个泡屎里28年的污秽的衣服嘲笑他个泡屎里79年的污秽的衣服。。。我之所以泡的少，是因为我活的少。我也是活少不折腾。不然，呵。唉。。。耶稣，救主。唯一。
不干，等一起干。2021/04/25 15:19，看到楼上中午吃的没收拾的。想着得收拾下去。想想，不干。我要等妈妈过来一起收拾。嗯。。。想到牧师讲的，我说他啥事都自己干。。。得合作才比较好啊。嗯。主啊，帮助我。好吧，我在这里，请差遣我。

其实我说的时候就感觉不对劲了。但没有人拦阻我，我就没法悔改。你能拦阻我，实在太感谢你了。我知道不对劲，但就是停不了啊。谢谢你。神的使者，神拯救了我。2021/04/25 21:16，和妈妈讲到早上的对话，她责备了我。说有时会宠着我，但有时我得要注意环境，不要过分。
其实她一点也不宠着我最好了。这样我就可以随时都可有不对就悔改了。但可能这样就没意思了吧。可能有时等我自己悔改父亲特别有喜乐？耶稣，我主耶稣基督，求你赐给我你的心。耶稣救我。
假冒为善的人。2021/04/26 09:15，早上要出发去学校了，去找院长告别，院长还想让我再留回搞这搞那，就说宣教士会搞。然后就走了。他开始'关怀'的问车费，又质问没有便宜的吗。呵。我走着去便宜啊。我给他免费干活便宜啊。我买车票又不用他出钱已经便宜到他了啊。对，他只是想再多占个嘴上的道德便宜，彰显他的'为善'。啊。。。
这假冒为善的人。。。（但天父将圣殿交给他们运营啊。耶稣也认可他们的地位。一边批评他们一边让百姓听从他们的教导只是不要效法其行为。因为，其没有。。。耶稣救我。）
金宣教士不来的话，我也不会来，其实他也就不会有那么多事。他那些事都是不必要的说。但我想了想，就说有啥事是需要的呢。嗯。需要都是被创造出来的嘛。。。我来了，自然他需要的就多了。不然他就不需要那么多。这个嘛，就像苹果手机。不创造出来，人就不需要。创造出来了，人就需要了。。。2021/04/26 09:21，想到最后离开前的关于院长的许多事情的对话，及对'需要'一词的思考。。。
（不过面对宗教领袖，我说什么话不合适。还是让耶稣来说吧。。。你看耶稣说的吧。嗯。。。这样回答才对。百姓可以不效法其行为，但耶稣也教导百姓要听从其教导。我作为百姓，听从耶稣的话，不是说像耶稣一样批评宗教领袖，而是听从耶稣的话，不效法宗教领袖的行为，但，按着耶稣的话，听从宗教领袖的教导。）
我很期待他不给你开支。这样会有什么变化呢。2021/04/26 09:29，想到之前的对话，是的了。如果世界爱，自然，我们是被动的。所以，这世界的苦难与逼迫对于天堂人来说及其关键的必要。

牧师也有沉睡暴露羞耻之时，我要小心了，不要被义人挪亚给咒诅了。2021/04/26 11:08，想着早祷的事情，想着开始时的热情现在就到点了去，因为牧师没起来开门啊，早去也没用。甚至有时，大家都到了在大门口靠着，然后师母来了用她的卡刷开。。。简直了。。。
然后想着说的时候，想到了挪亚也曾沉睡暴露过羞耻。。。嗯。。。我要给神的使者遮上羞耻而不是暴露，那是会激怒神的使者导致其咒诅我的。然后我就完蛋了。。。我要害怕神，害怕神的使者。同时，给神的使者遮盖上羞耻，神的使者会祝福的。我就有福了。。。我要尊敬神，尊敬神的使者。
别人给予人帮助人只是给点物质。但金宣教是把慈爱都给我了。。。2021/04/26 13:40，想着上帝给予我的，金钱是大块，但真的是小事，尤其是对于富人，金钱只是小事，神给我的真正难得的，有钱也难得的，是一个有爱的人啊。满满的慈爱。
神的形象。感谢神，赐下他自己的形象。满满的，慈爱，忍耐。又教导，温柔。当然，也有严厉的使者，拦阻我作恶。感谢神。被动主动，阻挡吸引，全面的，拯救了我。耶稣基督，我的救主。
信神的权威。不管合理不合理。如果合理，他总能成。如果不合理，他必不至失败。他总能弄得更好。2021/04/26 14:07，想着信神 可信的神。如果他不合理，他会处理的。甚至最后结果更加美好。因为超出了我的理解嘛。。。

父亲离开自己住自然是好。如果不能，那就自己也得离开住的。只留下象征。2021/04/26 14:10，想着院长老了糊涂了，挪亚醉酒了，也不讲理明明是自己的错，但神选择他作为代理人。不能得罪的。但平常生活自己不糊涂总会偶尔不经意和其糊涂产生冲动，这时处理不好就完蛋了，就算是对方糊涂，但神的权力选择他，我冲突了，就是我的错，就算他醉酒般糊涂了。
有闪和雅弗的敬畏与智慧自然能处理好。但以实玛利和以撒是和父亲分开住的。雅各和以扫也是离开父亲。雅各的众儿子则是父亲快死了去看下准备埋葬。
一切都刚刚好。2021/04/26 14:23，想着妈妈受的苦难与委屈，对于欺负她的人很生气，但想想，如若不然，我又能如何得到她的爱呢。她受的委屈和苦难，她得的福气与恩典，一切都是神在掌控火候，一切都刚刚好，打造出了我的这个亲爱的妈妈。
我总是觉得越多越好，这是魔鬼的贪婪了吧。神的艺术，一切，刚刚好。不多，不少。
种啥收啥。收啥种啥。我们的人生，无能自救。2021/04/26 15:26，想到我和院长的合作，种下不合作，收到更多不合作，然后，种下更多不合作。。。
没有金光亮在中间种下点合作，我们两个是不会有一点点合作的收成的。。。
可能那会养成他的恶劣的性格，并且，神经网络再得不到训练吧。Mon 26 Apr 2021 02:47:20 PM KST ，想着圣经中神的使者的儿女都得远离神的使者直到病了快死才来看看的事情，这样的话，他多孤独啊。然后想想，如果他一切得意，还有人天天伺候着天天问安着，是看着挺好。但，他怎么会去反思什么呢。啊。。。
那样的孤独，可能是好的吧。不知道呢。但知，神一切所做的，都刚刚好。让爱他的人，尽是益处。
我跟牧师对话练习韩语，宣教士总是阻止我不让我说话。。。Mon 26 Apr 2021 02:52:34 PM KST ，想起最后走之前的，和牧师对话，宣教士妈妈就不让我说。。。其实就算是吵架，也能，我觉得更能练习韩语。因为要更快更流利更响亮嘛。要不假思索的一下子就说出来。
毕竟吵架就是看谁说的快说的多说的声音大。。。
我这嫌弃着午餐肉。但有的人，没有肉。还有的人，没有午餐。Mon 26 Apr 2021 04:08:57 PM KST ，离开妈妈吃饭了，想着我的生活，其实应该非常满意才对。感谢神的恩典。一切，都恰到好处。

只说感受，不要抱怨。找不到人就惩罚人，这可连猫咪的黏人都不如。。。Mon 26 Apr 2021 05:01:16 PM KST ，和妈妈聊天，又是没有回复了。。。想着得怎样做怎样做的时候，想想，就只说了前半部分。就是感受。。。离开妈妈就像丢了妈妈一样。。。
啊。还好妈妈是一个成熟的人。不然，我就惨了。。。哈哈哈哈～～～
说了英语之后，院长听不懂也不爆炸了，电脑店店员更热情了，理发店老板剪的更仔细了，出租车司机给送到门前了，甚至连越南的小妹妹都更加热情了～～～Mon 26 Apr 2021 06:27:05 PM KST ，从院长那回来，然后下午休息一会，刚刚又出去剪头购物，这一圈下来啊，发现英语的世界，真是，流畅。。。
感谢神。借着金妈妈给我爱，让我有勇气面对英语。。。

The great majority of Anglicans are members of churches which are part of the international Anglican Communion. There are, however, a number of churches that are not within the Anglican Communion which also consider themselves to be Anglican, most notably those referred to as Continuing Anglican churches, and those which are part of the Anglican realignment movement.

Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the Catholic Church launched the Protestant Reformation in the German-speaking territories of the Holy Roman Empire. Beginning with the Ninety-Five Theses, first published in 1517, Luther's writings were disseminated internationally, spreading the early ideas of the Reformation beyond the influence and control of the Roman Curia and the Holy Roman Emperor.

Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th-century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary activity, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States, and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide.

Chapter 7, ZhengJiang, the miracles of Taylor and the patriots. 

The most famous figure of those missionaries in China may be James Hudson Taylor, who loves China and devoted himself to the mission of China. 

Taylor was born in 1832, and before he was born, his mother decided to offer him as God's servant of Chinese mission. After he grew up, he met some friends and got to know the information about Chinese mission, and waited for a chance to go to preach the Gospel to 400 millions Chinese. 

Like Peter or Paul or Saint Augustine, Taylor had lost his belief in God, but like Augustine, he returned to God again because of the prayer of his mother, and his older sister Amelia. To do the work of Chinese mission, he had done many preparations, such as Chinese study, medicine study, body exercise, and other preparations. 

Because he decided to go to China to preach the Gospel, he lost his betrothed girl, his father-in-law refused to give out his daughter to him, a man who decided to go to a poor, undeveloped land. After that, in 1853, Taylor joined "The China Evangelisation Society", and became the first missionary to be sent to China on September, 19. 

On March 1st, 1854, Taylor arrived at Shanghai, China, when he was 22 years old. In November of the same year, he met Dr. William Parker and his wife with his children, then they worked together. To be close to Chinese, Taylor wears Chinese clothes and Chinese hair style, he is the first one missionary who became the same with Chinese. Because of his endeavors, his work had a wonderful effect. 

In October 1856, Taylor left Shanghai and arrived at Ningbo, he lived with John Jones and worked together with him, but because of the different viewpoints about Chinese mission and the deficit problem, Taylor exited from John Jones' Chinese Mission Committee and organized an independent committee called "Ningbo Mission Committee". Thus, the verse of "Yahweh-Jireh" and "Ebenezer" became his slogan, which means "Yahweh will prepare" and "Yahweh helped us until now". As his slogan, Taylor relied on nothing but Yahweh. 

In many difficulties there are some joyful things for Taylor, one important is that he met Maria Dyer and fell in love with her. Maria came to Ningbo in 1853, and as a teacher of one church female school which was built by Mary Ann Aldersey. On January 20, 1858, when Maria was 22 years old she married Taylor and both of them were dressing Chinese clothes, in next year, July, they had their first daughter, Grace Dyer Taylor. 

Taylor managed almost everything of his church and hospital that made Taylor be sickened, and must return to his hometown England to get treatment On July 19, 1860. When he was in England to get treatment for his illness, he sent 5 missionaries to China including James J. Meadows. 

One important thing he had done when he was in London was the organization called "China Inland Mission". He opened an account as a foundation for this committee, and started to find funds. After he recovered from illness, Taylor went to China again with 16 missionaries on May 26, 1866. Although there were storms in his way, he arrived at Shanghai safely. 

When he was in China to do the holy work, there were many evil things that fell upon him from around Chinese, but the love of Christ in the heart of Taylor, made him show love instead of hate those Chinese. One most sad event was that he lost his children and his wife when he was in China. He buried his wife in ZhenJiang and returned to England to marry Jennie Faulding, who was one member of "China Inland Mission". 

There are five principles of "China Inland Mission": first is the member acceptance without distinction, whoever believes in Jesus and met the conditions can join in; Second is the objective of mission restricted in one reign; Third is the requirement that let them behave like Chinese; Fourth is not join into other movements such as the Boxer movement; Fifth is the more important thing, that is the enthusiasm of preaching gospel instead of his education; Sixth is the point of view about money, rely on willing support only; Seventh is the main purpose of their mission, that is to preach Gospel. 

The reasons made "China Inland Mission" success first is the freedom when Taylor was preaching gospel in China. Missionaries can go around China without restriction. The excellent ability in management of Taylor contributed to the success of his committee too. Moreover, although Taylor is an excellent man he is still humble before God and relies on nothing but the believing in God to overcome all difficulties. Taylor was called "the benefactor of China Inland" and was loved by many Chinese. 

Taylor had said, "If I had a thousand pounds China should have it- if I had a thousand lives, China should have them. No! Not China, but Christ. Can we do too much for Him? Can we do enough for such a precious Saviour?" This became his most famous quote in his quotes. Taylor practiced his quote, not him, but his whole family, his son Frederick Howard Taylor, his grandson James II, and his third generation James III, fourth generation James IV, all of them devoted themselves to the mission of China. He likes a grain of wheat, he died, but he bore many fruits. 

Through the history of Taylor's mission in China, we must agree that China owes him a lot. He suffered so many difficulties, not only by nature, but also by the Chinese. Although he suffered so much, he still loves China, and devoted himself, not only himself, but his family to China, not to China, according to his quote, that's to Christ. Maybe this is the reason for his great love, although he was hurt by Chinese. 

The love of Christ helped Taylor to love Chinese, those unloveliness ones, those who are unworthy to be loved. But is this not the love of Christ? Yes, this is the love of Christ, who love those sinners, those worthless ones. Moreover, he gave us worth, that's his flesh and his blood, give out to us, that's our values. We have nothing beside this value from Christ, maybe we have money, we have cars, we have houses, we have many precious things of this world, but all of those are worthless, and will be destroyed at once. Only the word of God will endure forever, his word, incarnated in this world, became flesh, that Jesus Christ. Like Taylor who devoted his life to China, but not for China, it's for Jesus Christ. Only in this way, can we become worthy men, and endure forever because of Him, Jesus Christ, the Word of God.
