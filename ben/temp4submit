我害怕享受，或者得到什么好东西。因为耶稣啊，和他的兄弟们，好像都是穷人出身，都有点仇富。。。我害怕他们。他们写的话，好可怕啊。就没有一点对享受的富人有善意的几乎。。。什么时候有过吗？保罗写的应该有，保罗稍微富有点可能对富人没那么大敌意，嗯。Tue 13 Apr 2021 09:11:33 AM KST ，想到我昨天把那么好吃的食物，按照耶稣和宣教士的指示，分享了出去。自己都没得吃了。想着如果妈妈有工资了可以买个新锅，是不是用新锅换兄弟的旧锅呢？因为我实在是不敢享受什么好东西。。。
无论是耶稣，是耶稣的兄弟教会柱石雅各，还是耶稣的其他的兄弟们，在他们的书信中，几乎看不到对富人的一点善意。。。他们都仇富。。。保罗应该有点对富人的善意吧？
因为神要怜悯人。贫穷则是一个非常好的角色来使人产生怜悯之心。
至于富人解释的不是肉体贫穷而是心灵贫穷的。这样的人嘛，雅各就直接咒诅了好像。。。（不过马太福音确实是讲灵里贫穷。不过有个结论是怎么也得不出来的，就是富有的人有福了，这样的结论是如何也得不出的。既然富有怎么也不有福，呵。）
但以前是穷人向富人传福音的，今天完全反过来了，是富人以金钱为宣教费而向穷人传福音。嗯。。。
圣经无论何时，是由传达者解释的。以前是穷人写下，穷人传达，也是偏向穷人的。现在则是，虽然穷人写下，但由富人传达，而写下的穷人已死，解释权完全在于传达者富人的嘴里。。。
不过富人不认为其是富人吧。。。如果真认为自己富有，可能不会那样的一点不给拉撒路。他只有认为自己也不足——不足以永永远远的享受，这样自己也并不富足啊，怎么能分给拉撒路呢。看享受的吧：谁得到了好东西呢？得到了好东西的那个人不对。嗯。
天国是比惨的吗？看耶稣的“配得”：启示录 5-12 大声说：“曾被杀的羔羊是配得权柄、丰富、智慧、能力、尊贵、荣耀、颂赞的。”    就是看他的苦难。或者说，惨。天国难道是靠谁在地上财富多享受多来荣耀的吗？是在地上为主受的苦难。也就是，惨。天国就是个比惨的地方。
其实我也是富有的，但真是，如果排列100名，最富的1,最穷的100,这样，我就算在90,也不会去看那剩下的10比我更穷的觉得富有，而是看别的更富有的觉得自己穷。唉。。。
我要悔改。害怕着过生活。我的喜乐，不敢再来自于物质享受-玛门的福。而是来自于神的话语-可喜爱可昼夜思想的神的福。
3모르겠다. Tue 13 Apr 2021 09:50:06 AM KST ，问至圣父和圣灵可以像圣子成肉身吗？1可以2不可以。我写了个3不知道。我是无知的。在神面前，我承认自己的无知。啊。。。想到了院长让搞直播的，我不懂。我是无知的在专家面前。
我要谦卑在神面前。神造我为餐巾纸大脑，我还想自大，过分了。。。我要谦卑在神面前。神造我为不可骄傲的人。神要我谦卑。我要谦卑。主啊，帮助我。
你逻辑链对了 屁股错了 又能得出什么有人支持的结论[捂嘴]
逻辑对什么，除非美元等于废纸，否则免谈（λογος，逻辑，免谈，不要逻辑。。。）（哦。在我看来，金宣教和沈院长的没用谈话，原来是极其有用的逻辑打磨啊。。。）
오후에 나가서 만나를 거둘 때, 아이패드를 교실에 놔둘 것이에요. Tue 13 Apr 2021 10:42:19 AM KST ,昨天妈妈给的美味食物，一下子就分完了。然后今天得出去买点我的吗哪级食物了。。。嗯。吗哪的特征：1没有别的可吃的。2不能存放。3会让人极其想念埃及的肉。
其实能这样做，也是性格如此吧。神就这样造成了。就像，如果他要我便宜旧平板，我就把珍贵新平板给他自己用旧的。如果他要我奉献一点，我就把大部分给他自己用一点。如果他要我分享食物，我就把食物留一顿剩下的全分出去。可能和他想要的不一样吧。。。但这样的做法，耶稣应该喜悦吧。毕竟他这样的教导，又这样的造成了我。。。没办法。。。我就适合这样的生活。。。这没办法的。。。感谢神。我满足于我的神而不是我自己。食物不是我的福分，可喜爱的可昼夜思想的神的话语才是我的福分。
首先是东京电力公司在得知2号机组的冷却系统失效后，在所有的内部科学家都建议立刻向反应堆注入海水冷却的时候，犹豫了。
注入海水就是彻底报废，而东京电力公司高层担心让自己几个亿美元的投资泡汤，所以拖延了整整20个小时。
其次是在事后处理上，切尔诺贝利是全国总动员，切尔诺贝利冲在最前面的，是皮卡洛夫 (Vladimir Pikalov) 大将，独自一个人驾驶配备了仪器的卡车，撞开大门冲入现场，获得了准确的辐射数据。尼可莱塔拉可诺夫将军负责指挥整个行动，自己是第一个登上屋顶的，比所有士兵都爬在最前面。
而日本首相菅直人在福岛核电站泄露以后要求自卫队出动直升机参加福岛核电厂的灭火工作，却遭到自卫队的拒绝，因为自卫队认为，这会有辐射污染的危险。东京电力公司给福岛核电站是留下了50名所谓的「福岛死士」。结果后面这50人被曝光，是东京电力公司通过黑社会拉来的临时工，大部分是欠高利贷的人，甚至还有一部分残障人士。这些人根本不具备修复核电站的能力和知识，仅仅是为了显示东京电力公司还在坚守；而东京电力公司的正式员工，如果出现了伤亡，东京电力公司需要全额赔付，所以全部撤走。
在这样贪生畏死的神仙操作下，福岛核电站作为放射源的堆芯依然没有拆除，还在不断的污染着用来降温的海水。
日本修建了137万吨的大桶来储存这些被污染的核废水，但是到去年9月的时候已经装了123万吨了，而且以每天140吨增加，现在，装不下了。
其实要解决核废水问题，很简单，现在核废水的半衰期是30年，如果日本愿意把核废水继续储藏一百年后再释放进海洋稀释，基本就不会对生态环境和人类造成危害了。
但是日本不愿意这样做，因为他们不想花钱。但是在花钱删帖上，日本政府日本政府非常豪横。日本外务省掏了24亿，内阁府掏了100亿，厚劳省掏了35亿，全都是为了海外舆论。钱不用在解决问题，而用在封别人的嘴。
想要开口向别人传福音时，想到了妈妈对我将她给的美味分享给别人的事情好像不太满意。嗯。是她让我分享的。我分享的极其热情，她又不太高兴。那么传福音呢？这样的极其热情，会让福音显得掉价吗？耶稣对犹太人跨洋越海宣教的热情是嘲讽的好像？吃完饭好好思考下。Tue 13 Apr 2021 05:30:03 PM KST ，去购物，打车回来了。想着老套路在车上传福音的时候，因我把宣教士妈妈给我的食物分享给别人，她的不满意，批评我没有智慧，而纠结了。最终没有多说话。唉。。。
我该如何做啊，我的主啊。不顺从你的话，肯定不对。但顺从你的话，你也不满意。我到底怎么做啊？哦对，你的心。这样按照字面顺从你的话，可能会最终把你定在十字架上，顺着你的话按照你的话把你给定罪了。这太搞笑了。。。我现在就是这样，按着金宣教的话，顺从着金宣教的话，把金宣教给定在错误的一方。。。
好处之一，就是不用再操心关于金钱的事情了。不用再服侍金钱了。因为金宣教知道了我这样的行为，她觉得不智慧，她就不能再将更多的金钱交给我管理了。就像那些变卖家产跟随耶稣的一样，他们这样做了，就不用再处理金钱的事情了。也就不用再管理金钱的事情了。没了嘛。Tue 13 Apr 2021 05:35:13 PM KST ，想到这样的话，金宣教下次就知道了，不能按着她原想的给我更多了。因为她已经知道了，给我再多，我也不会自己用更多，而是分给别人。。。哈哈哈哈。。。
然后想到了那些变卖家产的人，也是一样的啊。神给他们家产，他们不好好用，变卖了分给别人。然后去一无所有的跟随耶稣。但这正是神要的啊。因为耶稣也是一无所有啊。。。一无所有的天堂。只有一。没有别的。而地狱，则是无尽啊，无尽。天堂只有一个神，地狱里，每个都是神。
是她让我分享的。我分享的极其热情，她又不太高兴。那么传福音呢？这样的极其热情，会让福音显得掉价吗？耶稣对犹太人跨洋越海宣教的热情是嘲讽的好像？吃完饭好好思考下：经文：马太福音 23-15 “你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！因为你们走遍洋海陆地，勾引一个人入教，既入了教，却使他作地狱之子，比你们还加倍。
分析：耶稣的责备，是责备后面的，但耶稣的态度是夸奖前面的吗？换位思考下：你到处搜集资料，收集了，却用这资料攻击神的百姓。嗯。讲我吗？嗯。。。从前面开始就责备了。因为其心。神是看内心的。这是本质。但耶稣也让我们传道。马太福音 28-19 所以，你们要去使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗（或作“给他们施洗，归于父、子、圣灵的名”）。马太福音 28-20 凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守，我就常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。”
法利赛人传道使人作地狱之子，到底指什么呢？难道他们不也是传的独一真神吗？前面是讲侵吞寡妇的家产和假意做很长的祷告。哦。想起院长让我们祷告了。。。尴尬。。。也确实侵吞过我的家产。这过分了啊我。。。不过他也吞了金光亮的家产。嗯。能吐出来分她点不？应该能吧。毕竟，金宣教士的存在，能给他一个正当的侵吞别人的家产的理由。
可是，奉献呢？在让人奉献，和侵吞别人家产之间，嗯，我没有智慧了。按照金宣教士的说法。。。我路走窄了。。。算了。走窄路吧。。。唉。。。
如果他把吞我的给吐出来，还把吞别人的吐给我一点，我是会支持他的可能。。。主啊，如果可以，让他不要把吞金宣教的吐出来。。。让他继续的侵吞金宣教的家产，直到金宣教受不了侵吞而像我一样逃跑。。。主啊，求你封住他的口，让他不要吐出来所吞的金宣教的家产。就像过去的36天一样。只吞不吐。这样持续到70天就好了。。。让金宣教也和我站同一边：只被侵吞的一边。。。
但其实他吐出来了一点给我。只是我知道他要侵吞，就全部又主动献上任其侵吞了。。。金宣教如果有这态度，就算他吐出来一点给她，她也不可能在那里呆下去的。。。
现在她应该能理解那些变卖家产跟随耶稣的人了吧。Tue 13 Apr 2021 17：42,忽然想到她现在该知道了，如果她把她家产留给我，我也是卖了分给别人。。。
现在她应该能理解那些变卖家产跟随耶稣的人了吧。她现在就见到了她儿子把她给的“家产”分给了别人。。。（主啊，谢谢你，打造我成如此的人。我非常喜欢你造我如此。或者，你造我喜欢你造我如此。。。反正都是你。你是作者。你是一。唯有你。יהוה אלהינו יהיה אדח ）
路走窄了。嗯。其实耶稣正是要我们走窄路。。。Tue 13 Apr 2021 06:57:44 PM KST ，看着个“路走的宽宽的”的评论讲到人会做人会做事的。嗯。想着我许多事情做的啊，是路走窄了。。。嗯。。。

家在农村，早十几年，农村尚且热闹，多数青壮年还在农村。很多家庭会养猪，一为怕浪费饭后粮食，二可年底杀了备货过年。
（养猪的人怕浪费而养猪，吃的时候也怕浪费就把猪全吃。所以我们这些节俭的人，不如人家欧美人浪费，最后，也确实是不如人家能浪费。唉。。。真希望自己也能像他们一样的浪费。。。）
要宰的猪，前一晚好吃好喝招待好，不能做饿猪。
（感觉这个时代是最后一晚了。。。不然怎么突然物质这么丰富了起来。。。）
萧熏儿为什么非要嫁给萧炎？    建议女读者尽量不要读男频小说，这是写给男人看的    就跟你们女频小说七八个总裁爱上你一个道理    你为什么不问问那些女主凭什么有那么多总裁喜欢？
（幻想嘛。。。事实上是，量子生活。。。有爱，有恨。人心比万物都诡诈。但神总有恩典保护他的形象。啊～～～）
更大的风险对应更大的收益。就像天使长对抗上帝，有着无限大的风险，也有着可能的无限大的收益。如果没有冒险，就没有收获。但我不要这样的收获。除了神给的，我都不要。不需要。本来就没有的嘛。Tue 13 Apr 2021 03:56:55 PM KST ，听alt3听到相应的一句话，开始想到那个对抗上帝的天使长。嗯。想到我的 life_code 的开头，不要不满。否则最终就是天使长的命运。嗯。我很满足于神给的。我没有“不满”“要”的心。我满足于神给的。享受于其中。他的话语，可喜爱，又可昼夜思想。

我的大平板有两个操作系统，平时用的是 Android，刷alt1234等。还有个是win10,但我平时不用，因为太重。但如果要搞 delusions 就要换操作系统了。嗯。Android 是轻的，用来刷alt1234还有worshipAndBible的。Tue 13 Apr 2021 03:59:47 PM KST ，想着晚上我得切换到win系统来拤一波的时候，想到我这大平板有两个操作系统。一个就是可以拤一波的。一个是没法的。真好。不应该的，就没法。实在是如同天国城墙一样的恩典。感谢神。不应该的，没法的，完全没想法的。嗯。感谢神。
还好还可以有另一个放这样的 delusions 的地方。嗯。切换过去就可以了。等会即可。大概纯粹的 Android 刷alt1234和 worshipAndBible，能3-4天吧。然后量子一下 delusions 。没有意义的，浪费时间的。但还好，是两个完全不同的操作系统，他们之间不会有交流，这样再切换回 Android 继续人生主线的 alt1234 和 worshipAndBible 就不会有任何的干扰影响。在这个 Android 里也不会有什么想法干扰。真好。因为不该就不行也不能。真好。分别的。完全不会污染我的 alt1234 和 worshipAndBible. 因为不该还真就不行也不能。天国城墙的恩典。
妈妈有两个人：20210412, 0336, 宣教馆一楼半床铺，梦见：准备起来参加早祷，想着得4点多了吧，一看3点多，有点尿感，但想着就再睡会吧。这时妈妈进来了。然后抱着嘛，抖了下。想着不行了（有尿意），我得去下厕所了，就要去厕所。然后妈妈问了句，这不往后了吗？我就想去厕所，去厕所下楼的时候呢，外面门开了，唉呀，妈妈从外面回来了，当时我就崩溃了，哦，哦啊，然后我就醒了。
来我床上的是一比不挂的。上厕所时回来的是从外面参加早祷回来的，妈妈穿着正常衣服的。（梦里的我也很明白。这个从外面回来的，参加完早祷回来的，穿着正常衣服的妈妈，是我所要的妈妈。至于那屋里的一丝不挂的，就不知道是什么玩意的。就因此崩溃了。哦啊，就因此醒了。）（梦中在床上的时候抖了下，这个得注意。梦里这个是梦遗的征兆嘛。但神是看我内心。我心如果作恶，那真是，恶者想引诱我在梦中作恶，但即使在梦里，神也保守。让我看到了，我想要的人，是穿着衣服，从外面祷告回来的，妈妈。）
妈妈讲的，师母就一走了留下她一个人做饭的，她说她知道，如果她这也不干的话，她们就祷告求换一个人了。嗯。头，是要当仆人的。

梦见我卖什么，最后卖了一个检查生活质量的，然后面前来一个女的，说是要亲我。20210413,0407, 梦见那个女的亲我，然后有个袋子，然后里面是虫子。以为弄死了大的，飞出来了小的，以为弄死了大的还好。其实大的也没弄死。然后也飞出去了。有很多都没弄死。那些毒虫其实一个都没弄死其实。还是给封印的严严的好。

梦见，20210413,0623,梦见和会长们小姑娘们一起上课，然后吃的东西，碗都没刷之类的，然后刷碗，然后位置坐满了，没法一起上课了，我就换个位了，要去妈妈那边了，正好妈妈让牧师来接我，然后牧师还倒了，晕倒在地。然后没有水就给了他点奶喝。然后他胳膊就从苍白色变得有血色了，就自己起来了。然后就带回去了。然后妈妈翻译。妈妈特别的苍老了。然后我听着啊，我在底下，拤拤拤，毫无情欲的拤了一波完事。然后找裤子穿。然后她那里也有我的衣服。然后我就穿上。然后妈妈介绍自己。开始做饭。特别好吃。然后妈妈介绍自己，说自己一个人，特别孤独。虽然妈妈这么老了，但人还是很愿意很愿意的和她一起生活。也是一个小老头。很愿意很愿意和她一起过日子。毕竟做饭那么好吃，人也那么好。唉呀，很抢手很抢手的。

梦到，20210413,0830,梦见一个人把自己女儿整的特别像一个贵妇人的女儿，贵妇人看见就特别爱她，然后他女儿就和那贵妇人的女儿一起生活。贵妇人的女儿看见她太寒碜了，就想去掉她们的高低贵贱之分，就把自己的东西都卖了，卖了20多万，又添了20多万，给那个穷人的女儿打扮的漂漂亮亮的，打扮的贵一点。然后爸爸看见了，帐都是他结的吧。然后那个女儿说，某某人太寒碜了，没法进学校。然后就给她打扮。然后爸爸也没有生气。她那委屈的都要哭了。为了那个寒碜的人委屈。
为什么是20万呢？嗯。想到金是因为我损失了20万吧。嗯。加上吗？好吧。加上吧。她付出的太多了为了我。唉。。。
不信耶稣的人能有啥损失呢。如果他们真的觉得有损失，怎么可能会不信耶稣呢。没有得到的东西，怎么会有失去的逻辑呢。你告诉我刚刚我没拜你损失了100万？哼，滚你个贱人！！！对。。。我都这样的。。。Tue 13 Apr 2021 04:35:00 PM KST ，想着因为我金光亮妈妈损失的20万。唉呀。其实得算成28万吧。对，少算了8万。加上利益得28万。然后想到权太星也不愿意和金光亮同住，也不愿意给我一点恩典。唉呀。想着他不害怕以后的损失吗？想到了有人不信耶稣都不会觉得有损失，我算个什么玩意儿。。。
如果他觉得有损失，为了自己的利益，肯定会做出点什么。当然，人家富有不在乎这点损失，也合情合理。（不过要是权先走了，留妈妈一个孤单，妈妈再嫁，应该是韩国的牧师吧。可能是中国的某个小老头吗？反正小老头想有个小老太太这是肯定的。。。）（如果她能愿意当寡妇就好了。。。清心为主守着。是更美好的事情。行吧。先想到这里。再加上那个8万，上传了这个，然后提交下。准备去买点东西了得，没有吃的了要。。。）
她的工资虽然比生我的父母高，但还是太低了。导致她的生命——就是她的时间，大量的投入到我身上了。唉。。。更加的亏欠了。愿一生服侍着。我所永远亏欠的那位啊，愿永远服侍你。永永远远。Tue 13 Apr 2021 04:42:20 PM KST ，又加上那个上面的利息的计算。更加的亏欠了啊。怎么办啊。上帝啊，上帝给我的恩典，我对上帝的亏欠，是理当服侍他的一个原因。嗯。我也得理当服侍着金光亮了吧。毕竟她也是神的代理人。这样的训练，能让他看到我将来，永永远远服侍着他的态度吧。
我要永永远远服侍着他。我一切所有的来源。我永永远远亏欠的那一位。我要永永远远的服侍着。现在，训练着。展示给你我的态度。永永远远的态度。服侍着你，为我牺牲，为我付出的主。以你的珍贵，来使卑贱的我变得有价值。愿这价值，永永远远的服侍着你。愿你看到我的态度，在这短暂的世界，我永永远远要服侍你的心。



























우리 엄마 이번에 한국에 온 후 교회서 구제금을 받은 적이 있어요?  없다  
우리 엄마 충성된 요나단 같아요. 내가 생각하는 것 보내 드릴게요. 엄마가 다윗을 찾을 수 있으면 좋겠지만 다윗 찾기 어려워요. 하지만 충성된 요나단은 인정받을 수 밖에 없어요. 내 엄마 요나단.
사무엘기하 1-26 내 형 요나단이여 내가 그대를 애통함은 그대는 내게 심히 아름다움이라 그대가 나를 사랑함이 기이하여 여인의 사랑보다 승하였도다
우리 엄마 내가 쓰던 설교 “내 형 요나단의 사랑” 봤어요?  아직 안봤어  네가 와서 엄마한테 설교하라  
응. 우리 엄마는 바로 나의 요나단. 위에서 주신 사랑. 우리 엄마는 나의 예수님과 같아요.
에베소서 4-13 우리가 다 하나님의 아들을 믿는 것과 아는 일에 하나가 되어 온전한 사람을 이루어 그리스도의 장성한 분량이 충만한데까지 이르리니
그리스도의 장성한 분량인 우리 엄마. 교만하지 마세요. 그렇게 하면 떨어질 수 있어요. 계속계속 장성하세요.
아들도 이제 숙제 해야 돼요. 아들이 키보드 있어서 입력하기 편해요. 많은 글자를 쓰지만 엄마처럼 불편하는 것이 아니에요. 네. 기다릴게요. 지금부터 숙제 해요.




(음식 사진) 우리 엄마의 사랑.
그리고, 엄마의 사랑을 받고 이 사랑으로 많은 이들을 사랑했어요.
감사합니다. 우리 사랑이 많으신 선교사님 엄마. 하나님이 엄마를 더욱더 축복하시고 엄마를 통해 더 많은 이들에게 사랑을 전할 수 있기를 원해요.
하나님이 우리 엄마를 사용하시고 모세나 예수님을 통해 천만인에게 음식을 제공해 주시는 것 같이 우리 엄마를 통해 더 많은 이들에게 음식을 제공해 주시길 원해요.






우리 교수님이 일이 있어서 빨리 수업을 끝냈어요.

오후에 나가서 만나를 거둘 때, 아이패드를 교실에 놔둘 것이에요.

수업이 일찍 끝나서 시간이 많겠다.

시간 낭비말고 하나님께 삶에서 지혜 달라고 기도해.

삶의 지혜는 글로만 써서 되는 것이 아니다

네. 지혜부족한 아들이 매일매일 하나님 아버지께 지혜를 달라고 해야 돼요.

어제 내가 꿈에서 또다시 엄마를 봤어요.

엄마도 마찬가지야

아마 몇년 뒤, 엄마가 다른 목사님을 만나고 이제보다 늙어도 계속계속 하나님을 위해 일해요. 그리고 나이나 모습이 어떻게 되는지에 상관없이 여전히 엄마에 반한 사람이 많아요.

하나님의 사람이 제일 매력적인 사람이라서 많은 사람을 매료할 수 있어요. 나도 그중에 한 명이에요. 하지만 하나님의 사람은 하나님만의 사람이에요. 우리 엄마는 매력적인 하나님의 천사 같지만 하나님의 매력적인 천사 처럼 자기를 높이지 마세요. 모든 매력은 다 하나님이 그의 사자에게 주시기 때문에요.






다들 엄마의 솜씨를 인정했어요. 그리고 더 달라고 하는 자도 있어요... 아쉽지만 지금 내게는 빈 박스 밖에 없어요... 우리 엄마는 진짜로 매력적인 사람이네요. 엄마의 학생부터 목사님까지, 그리고 모르는 사람이라도 엄마의 손맛을 좀 맛보면 금방 엄마에 반해요.

이런 엄마가 내 엄마가 되는 것은 말로 표현할 수 없는 하나님의 큰 은혜이예요. 하나님 아버지께 감사해요.

에유~

엄마는 아직 예배중

그래요. 아들이 이제 아이패드를 끄고 숨어야 돼요. 엄마에 반해서 숙제 못해요. 게다가 하나님이 질투하신 분이라서 아들의 생명하고 엄마의 생명을 위해 하나님의 질투를 피해야 돼요. 우리 이제 서로를 떠나서 하나님 아버지하고 연락합시다. 그리고 오직 그분이 유일하신 하나님입니다. 아들의 좋은 것이나 엄마의 좋은 것이나 다 그분께서 나온 것입니다. 하나님 아버지께 갑시다.







Revised____________________________

Chapter 5, Shanghai, the mission of saving the nation in modern history of China.

Shanghai developed quickly to become a pearl in Asia. Shanghai's development benefited from those missionaries from Europe and America. After the 18th century, the Christianity of Europe and America started to organize missionary unions and sent many missionaries abroad, their destinations also include China, thus the gate of closed China, Shanghai, became a suitable place for those missionaries.

After the 1st Opium war, the government of the Qing dynasty made the NanJing treaty with England, and because of this treaty, five places in Shanghai were selected to be opened for trading. Thus Shanghai opened his doors toward abroad missionaries. In 1843, Walter Henry Medhurst, William Lockhart, and William Muirhead arrived at Shanghai, built a hospital, printing  house and living house. Because Medhurst had experience in the area of printing houses, so he focused on this area.

Above mentioned three men were persecuted in 1848, because of their missions. When they were preaching the Gospel in JiangSu, they had conflicted with some ones, but because they are foreigners they were protected, and those who conflicted with them were captured. Moreover, there are some unfair treaties between China and other nations, the Gospel can be hardly preached to many Chinese.

After those events, the Anglican of England, the Anglican, Presbytery, Baptism, and other sects came into Shanghai to build churches and preach the Gospel. Thus after the 2nd Opium war, Shanghai became a base station of China's mission. Because of those factors, industry and commerce developed quickly in Shanghai and made Shanghai an international city of China. Missionaries preached the Gospel to the people of Shanghai at first, but with the development of Shanghai, there were many people who came from outside of Shanghai, and missionaries preached gospel to those outsiders too.

In 1906, pastor YuGuozhen in Shanghai came out from the presbytery of North America and started the autonomous church of China. Thus the autonomous movement was started. WuYaozhong is a famous figure in the movement, he proclaimed that the church of China should come out from the control of western world, and he started the three-self movement with many other leaders in 1950, Shanghai. On November, 23, the same year, the article of WuYaozhong about this movement was published on "People's Daily", which was the most famous newspaper in China. WuYaozhong and other leaders organized the "Three-self patriotic movement committee" in Beijing, 1954. After that, the Christianity of China became a new organization under the control of the Socialist system.

The foundation stones of Christianity in China were XuGuanqi, LiZhizhao and YangYanjiun. Those three men were called "Three holy cornerstones of Chinese Catholic". XuGuanqi lived from 1562 to 1633, he was a famous scientist of the Ming dynasty, as a high level official, he came from Shanghai. He has met a priest of Jesuits, who is called Lazaro Cattaneo, and has studied about European science and the theology  of Christianity. In 1603, he went to NanJing, and met priest Joannes de Rocha, was baptized and got a name called Paul. After that, he used the merits of Christianity to start the revolution of China society in that period. He thought that the doctrine of the Christianity is useful, and can supplement and update Confucianism and Taoism.

Another famous figure was like XuGuanqi, called PanYunduan, the builder of the famous tourist spot "YiYuan" in Shanghai. His first name was used by a Catholic priest, Frarcuis Brancati. Frarcuis Brancati was a Italian missionary, a member of Jesuits, he came into Shanghai in 1637 and studied Chinese language and Chinese culture, there were many Chinese following him.

WangTao was a man who witnessed the completion of Chinese Bible. Although there was Chinese Bible translated already by Morission, it's difficult to read. Thus in the 19th century, Walter Henry Medhurst and Elijah Coleman Bridgman and other Protestants translated another Chinese version of the Bible called "WeiBanBen". The New Testament of this Chinese Bible was finished in 1850, and after 3 years, in 1853, the Old Testament was finished too. The supervisor of the last step of this Bible version translation was WangTao. But there were still many arguments in this version, such as the name of "God", thus there were two different versions published, one was the version called "Shen", and another one was the version called "ShangDi". However this translation was admired a lot though there were some arguments.

The reason why WantTao became a believer of Christianity was his translational work. After he finished the translation work, he suffered sickness and accepted Christ in that period. WantTao said, "The Goal of his Gospel is for our spiritual salvation." Admittedly, there were some defects of WangTao, such as his political desires which he didn't give up although he believed in Christ. WantTao was persecuted for his belief too. He died in March 1897, Shanghai.

Timothy Richard was a familiar name to Chinese Christian, he was a missionary of England. When he was 20 years old, he entered seminary and decided to preach gospel to China when he was 23 years old. He affected Chinese not only in religion but also in society. A famous organization of Timothy Richard was his "GuangXueHui", also called "TongMenShuHui" which means a Society for Diffusion of Christian and General Knowledge among the Chinese. He returned to England in May, 1916, because of his worse health condition, and he died on April 20th, 1919, London.

Charles Jones was a man who devoted himself to saving the nation by his belief. Charles Johns' original name was ShongJiaShu, a man of HeNan, Hakka. When he was 11 years old, in 1875, he went to America where his uncle lived. Being persuaded by his Chinese friends, he entered theology seminary and was baptized, and got a new name called Charles Jones Soong. He entered seminary in 1881, was supported by Julian S. Carr, and graduated in 1885, became a pastor and went to Shanghai by missionary role. He married NiGuizhen in 1886, and had 5 children.

Watchman Nee was a man who affected western Christianity, although he was a Chinese. He was born in 1903, GuangDong province. His original name was Henry Nee, but after he became a christian, he changed his name to Watchman Nee. He was well known in China due to his "Small Group Church Movement". Although he had lost his belief he recovered by an amazing event. Many Chinese Christian followed his thought and entered the Small Group Church. Thus there are many missionaries and existing churches criticised him. He devoted himself to preaching the Gospel and warned others to be careful about the Chinese government.

There were many famous churches in Shanghai, one of them was Moore Memorial Church. Moore Memorial Church was built in 1887, the Qing dynasty, by the support of missionary LiDe.

Shanghai is a special city, which is a great gate of China. All of us know that without trading with others, we can't know how many things in this world, also, without communication with others, we can't know how much information in this world. A closed China is a dead nation although it's still breathing, God saved China by those invaders, they forced China to open her gates to outside. Man's heart is evil, but God's heart is good. God is good although those invaders are evil.

By such a way of using evil man to do his holy work, God opened China's gates, Shanghai is beloved that she was one place to be elected as a gate to be opened to the outside world. Trading was here, and religions were here too. Shanghai became a rich city more than other places of China, in money and in culture, even in religion. Those who were elected by God's will must open their doors to welcome his gospel. Opening their door with willingly heart, or by force. No matter how they open their doors, God's will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. Shanghai is a special place in China, but in the spiritual angle, all of us are special, for the election of God.

Chapter 5, Shanghai, the mission of saving nation in modern history of China.

Shanghai developed quickly to become a pearl in Asia. Shanghai's developing benefited from those missionaries from Europe and America. After 18th century, the Christianity of Europe and America started to organize missionary union and sent many missionaries abroad, their destinations also include China, thus the gate of closed China, Shanghai, became a suitable place for those missionaries.

After the 1st Opium war, the government of Qing dynasty made the NanJing treaty with England, and because of this treaty, there are five places in Shanghai were selected to be opened for trading. Thus Shanghai opened his doors toward abroad missionaries. In 1843, Walter Henry Medhurst, William Lockhart, and William Muirhead arrived at Shanghai, built hospital, printing  house and living house. Because Medhurst had experience in the area of printing house, so he focused on this area.

Above mentioned three man were persecuted in 1848, because of their missions. When they were preaching Gospel in JiangSu, they had conflicted with some ones, but because they are foreigners they were protected, and those who conflicted with them were captured. Moreover, there are some unfair treaty between China and other nations, the Gospel can be hardly preached to many Chinese.

After those events, the Anglican of England, the Anglican, Presbytery, Baptism, and other sects came into Shanghai to build church and preach the Gospel. Thus after the 2nd Opium war, Shanghai became a base station of China's mission. Because of those factors, industry and commerce developed quickly in Shanghai and made Shanghai an international city of China. Missionaries preached Gospel to the people of Shanghai at first, but with the developing of Shanghai, there were many people came from outside of Shanghai, and missionaries preached gospel to those outsiders too.

In 1906, pastor YuGuozhen in Shanghai came out from the presbytery of North America and started the autonomous church of China. Thus the autonomous movement was started. WuYaozhong is a famous figure in this movement, he proclaimed that the church of China should come out from the control of western world, and he started the three-self movement with many other leaders in 1950, Shanghai. On November, 23, the same year, the article of WuYaozhong about this movement was published on "People's Daily", which was the most famous newspaper in China. WuYaozhong and other leaders organized the "Three-self patriotic movement committee" in Beijing, 1954. After that, the Christianity of China became a new organization under the control of the Socialist system.

The foundation stones of Christianity in China were XuGuanqi, LiZhizhao and YangYanjiun. Those three men were called "Three holy cornerstones of Chinese Catholic".

He has met a priest of Jesuits, who is called Lazaro Cattaneo, and has studied about European science and the theology  of Christianity. In 1603, he went to NanJing, and met priest Joannes de Rocha, was baptized and got a name called Paul. After that, he use the merits of Christianity to start the revolution of China society in that period. He thought that the doctrine of the Christianity is useful, can supplement and update the Confucianism and Taoism.

Another famous figure was like XuGuanqi, called PanYunduan, the builder of the famous tourist spot "YiYuan" in Shanghai. He first name was used by a Catholic priest, Frarcuis Brancati. Frarcuis Brancati was a Italian missionary, a member of Jesuits, he came into Shanghai in 1637 and studied Chinese language and Chinese culture, there were many Chinese followed him.

WangTao was a man who witnessed the completion of Chines Bible. Although there was Chinese Bible translated already by Morission, it's difficult to read. Thus in 19th century, Walter Henry Medhurst and Elijah Coleman Bridgman and other Protestants translated another Chinese version of Bible called "WeiBanBen". The New Testament of this Chinese Bible was finished in 1850, and after 3 years, in 1853, the Old Testament was finished too. The supervisor of the last step of this Bible version translation was WangTao. But there were still many arguments in this version, such as the name of "God", thus there were two different versions were published, one was the version called "Shen", and another one was the version called "ShangDi". However this translation was admired a lot though there were some arguments.

The reason caused WantTao became a believer of Christianity was his translational work. After he finished the translation work, he suffered sickness and accepted Christ in that period. WantTao said, "The Goal of his Gospel is for our spiritual salvation." Admittedly, there were some defects of WangTao, such as his political desires which he didn't give up although he believed in Christ. WantTao was persecuted for his belief too. He died in March 1897, Shanghai.

He returned to England in May, 1916, because of his worse health condition, and he died on April 20th, 1919, London.

Charles Jones was a man who devoted himself to saving the nation by his belief. Charles Johns' original name was ShongJiaShu, a man of HeNan, Hakka. When he was 11 years old, in 1875, he went to America where his uncle lived.
