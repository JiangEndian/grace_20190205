我只想建立教会。Wed 20 Jan 2021 10:30:44 PM KST ，想着如果回国了，想干什么，我就想这样。然后，刚刚啊，特别的喜乐。想着我的生活啊，在主的爱里。有要做的事。就是要传福音。我就要做这个事。不做别的事占用我可工作的时间。嗯。
可能别人看为不正经吧。嗯。。。从自己开始，过上敬拜的生活。嗯。不正经嘛，总有神的百姓。总有神要的百姓。这样，即使这一生只传一个，也比干其他正经的事情，要有价值无数倍。啊～～～灵魂啊～～～胜过全世界的价值。该隐的建城工作，算个啥呢。呵！！！（不过城主该隐不喜欢我这样的吧，哈哈哈哈。。。）
人生的本质就是修修补补。所以不需要换语言换技术。除非他能让自己的修修补补更容易。Thu 21 Jan 2021 09:36:36 AM KST ，面对自己的开发过程，想到开始的时候，现在的时候，有很多在开始时没有想到。现在也有很多没有想到的未来需要修修补补的吧。。。人生嘛。。。

我这也不会那也不会，连蒙都懒得蒙，但我是一个好学生。20210113，0809,想到燕燕姐姐，在最后考试的时候，连线书名和人名，不知道就没连，就自夸。反正就是自己很骄傲。虽然自己啥都不会，但自己诚实的表示自己啥都不会了。唉呀，天呐。。。

如果能见到耶稣，我就很难跟随了。我能见到耶稣的脸，我就很难跟随了。不管耶稣是什么样子，是牧师的样子也罢，是教授的样子也罢，我都不会满意的，都很难跟随了。20210113,0812,想到我并不喜欢的牧师和教授，其实都是我主的代表。啊。。。

我被骗是因为我有。20210114，0740,想到高中的时候，住的房子电力都不足，还买了个豆浆机，还100多，那人就是黑我，来下乡下来骗我们这些没有见识的农村人，当时我为什么买了呢？因为我看见钱了，就拿着用了。如果没有钱，就不会被骗。没有钱真好，有钱我就会被骗。但还好，感谢神，被骗怎么也比骗人好。
主啊，愿你审判，从我开始，从我这被人骗的愚昧人开始。
梦中，20210121,0338,梦见纪亚光，还梦见纪茵。梦见纪茵要和我谈恋爱，我就很高兴。然后她要我帮她做什么。然后我就没有力量。然后她看见就知道了，一个人没有力气就干啥都没有力气。然后就和我分了。然后我看看纪亚光，就想，他有力量，他干啥都有力气，欺负我也有力量。然后他要去哪个地方，有个高地，对我不爽，就把水扔下来，要下来打我。我就开始疯狂的大喊。
对，他欺负我打我的时候，初中的时候了，我就会打滚哭。到现在也是只能哭啊。只能在上帝面前哭。在梦中就叫啊，就要闹啊，他就没办法了。我就要死也要跟他搞一搞啊。他也就没办法了。欺负的稍微轻了点了。初中经历的霸凌和高中经历的霸凌。到大学经历的霸凌呢？那都是小事了。算个啥啊。
啊，但那些（欺负我的）人也真是，真帅啊。又帅，实力又大，能欺负人的。当时我就要跟他们变得一样。可能是为了不被他们欺负。反正就是纯粹的哭那时。初中开始尝试和他们变得一样。然后，一个农村孩子啊，看见乡里孩子那样就也那样。唉。高中也是那样。唉。。。我有啥资本啊。还好背后有上帝，不然我就完蛋了。然后大学也那样。我有啥资本啊。还好上帝给扭转回来了，不然我就完蛋了。唉。。。
一路上有数十个数百个万个，完蛋，在等着我。我凭啥能一路走到今天？那么多完蛋在等着我。还有很多人，凭啥走过来？若不是上帝的保守，那一秒少保守点，就没了。不过这个梦或许是昨天白天遇见会长了，他打招呼，然后手放我胸上，唉呀，感受到这种无力感吧。在同学面前的无力感。引发了我大脑对高中大学时的无力感，只能以命来反抗的无力感。初中时还哭呢。高中时就开始拿命来反抗了，死命的反抗。大学时也是努力和他们变的一样。唉呀，我真是，我这个家伙啊。一百万个完蛋点。埋伏着阴我。神啊，神都一一的保守过来了。少了一点点，我就活不成了。唉。。。
不过也是，我就不用找对象了。因为梦里梦到的嘛。然后她讲我没力气，就干啥都没力气的。虽然她可能之前，不知道为啥要喜欢我一下。就是有个男朋友好听呗，但没想到我这个人实在是不行。就只能换一个了。我也不知道她为什么能看上我这种人，有病呗。。。然后分了。当时我梦里就想啊，还好她不知道，我腰不好身体不好的。知道就更得和我分了。
唉，这不是我前女友和我分的嘛？纪茵没有和我分的。（对，确实没法知道她为啥要喜欢我一下，因为，根本就没有这回事。。。）她为什么要和我谈恋爱呢当时？她就有病呗。和我这种完全看不上的人谈恋爱，真是脑子有病。感谢神，让她脑子有病过一下，让我有过一个女朋友，让我做过一段浪漫的梦。让我知道现实和梦境没啥区别。除了比梦境记的更加深刻。现实的冷漠啊，也是比梦境更加的深刻。没啥区别，没啥区别。跟我这种看不上的人谈恋爱，就是有病。明明看不上，不可能走的，不可能走的下去的。唉呀。。。
想到了梦中，好像是因为，我当舔狗帮了她？然后就这样，她觉得挺善良的，可以用一下？可能是这个原因。不过，用一下，也不用谈恋爱之类的，这也太老实了吧。看我燕燕姐姐用我，就是一个电话就来了，我就屁颠屁颠的过去被用了。真好。感谢神。慢慢的我要成为保罗似的人物了。嘿嘿。说出那些极端的言论。直接过滤很多人，得到另一些人的支持。唉呀。不容易啊。
也可能是因为院长那边的霸凌。我从小到大就没有顺心的，就没有不被欺负的。为啥呢？因为太弱了。大家也都知道啊。大家也没法欺负强的啊。就是因为我是弱的。他们欺负只能欺负弱者。这个世界就这样。上帝让我这样的，一切都弱，从小到大被欺负，到现在也是被欺负，是要我更加的向往天堂啊。哈利路亚，我向往天堂。这个世界，男人女人的，拉倒滚蛋吧。不过还真是，不非常烂了。还有神的形象在其中。够了。毕竟是堕落的形象。我又有啥好吗？哈利路亚，我没有资本说别人。感谢神，我不说了。
从小到大，这些东西都没和家里人讲哈，背后没有一人。还好还好能哭，到现在我都是靠哭解决问题。哈利路亚，我始终是维持在一个小孩的状态。没长大。还是靠哭来解决问题。
好像是从初中开始啊，那时怎么就知道家庭背景差的呢？我爸来学校看我都不高兴，觉得他给我丢人了就非常的不想理。我那时怎么就知道不如别人的呢？怎么就知道的呢？其实都懂，都知道。我现在也深深的知道。大家都能看出来。我就是个土包子。彻头彻尾的土包子。愿意指出来的人，还是愿意帮助我成长的。感谢上帝，有爱我的人，愿意为我指出来。感谢神。
如果不给我指出来呢？任凭我无知骄傲自大，那真是走向灭亡了。圣经若不给我指出来外邦人是狗，狗也吃主人桌子上的零碎，我还不知道在我神面前多骄傲呢。面对我神的恩典，别人不要的恩典，我还得不满呢真是。圣经直接给我指出来了，并且给了一个榜样。面对我狗一样的事实，我该怎么去处理的榜样。我也更加的感恩了。圣经若不给我指出来，我真是，无知骄傲自大，在我神面前。骄傲那真是，和我神对着干了。
神爱我，才给我指出来，神爱我，才派个天使给我指出来。神爱我所以才直接给我指出来我是狗这个事实。神爱我所以才派个天使来给我指出来我是个土包子，在她们面前是个彻头彻尾的土包子这个事实。我挺感恩的。我不自卑。神的目的也不是让我自卑啊。就是让我有自知之明而已。也是让我更加成长。神的目的是好的。
既然这样，我干嘛不直接找个有毛病的呢？刚刚想，和我谈恋爱的人是有毛病吗？然后想到，既她们有毛病，我干嘛不直接找个有毛病的呢？狗啊，土鸡啊，配有毛病的对象啊，简直完美搭配。神的恩典，让我们这类人，更加的，在上帝面前，知道怎样生活。啊～～～

唉呀，想到姥姥的话了，看见她的女儿就哭了，想让她离婚的。唉呀，神啊。换一个人，然后生个孩子，多好啊。这样的话，她一直跟着权，权没有孩子，她也只能没有孩子。权如果有孩子，可能也能改变下那个样子吧。唉呀，她真是特别付出啊，从一而终。这样的人才是上帝要的啊，不管对方怎样，自己始终是守着，感恩着，忠心着对方。我是做不到反正。对方稍微对我有点不好，就再见了。恩典归恩典，一码归一码。很感恩的。以后再说，不能牺牲我一生。
她就是特别能忍耐啊，可能和从小就受委屈有关吧。哭啊，哭吧，在上帝面前哭干了眼泪，剩下的，都是坚强。神擦去她的眼泪，赐给她坚强。我羡慕吗？那得受更多委屈。其实我受的委屈也不少了吧。但她是真的能忍啊。我也差不多。在上帝面前再怎样哭，再怎样抱怨，没法脱离的环境，也是忍耐着。。。感谢神。。。
耶稣被欺凌的时候，也是没法反抗啊。被人吐吐沫在脸上，被人打，被人压迫着。他也没法反抗啊。唉呀，他就不说话了。可能他知道吧，说话就是给自己自找侮辱。唯有以沉默对抗一切。这是我主的能力，沉默。面对这个世界的压迫，霸凌，我主以沉默来应对一切，不抱怨，不求饶，对这个世界毫无指望，被这个世界欺凌着，沉默，来对抗一切。
最后若不是为了那个罪名，“犹太人的王”，他来正是为此，为这个罪名，他承认了。于是这个罪名被钉在他头上，犹太人的王。用三种语言写上，犹太人的王。犹太人那样对他，不愿意自己作他们的王，但他，还是，要犹太人成为他的子民。啊。我主的刚强，沉默，坚定。我主耶稣。沉默，沉默，沉默。以沉默，来对抗世界。主啊，我愿你来，灭了这个世界。这个曾经欺凌你的世界。（其实想到的是那些欺凌我的。我没办法啊，没能力啊，就等着我主来灭了他们。但我主可能是想救他们的灵魂吧。其实我也不好。虽然我是被欺负的。感谢神，还好我是被欺负的。我也不好嘛，我还不被欺负，他怎么怜悯我啊。感谢神。）
我面对霸凌这么多年，还活下来，心理没变态，一个重要原因就是上帝的话，如果不是上帝的话就完蛋了。刚刚睡觉嘛，咋能睡着呢。听上帝的话嘛。然后就平安了，放下来了。
初中，高中，大学，还好床头有圣经啊。如果没有圣经的话我就完蛋了。现在就没有圣经了。不在枕头底下了。直接进脑子里。感谢神，提升了我的科技，让我能更密切的接触上帝的话。
我主耶稣基督的无声，他的沉默，面对这个世界的压迫的沉默无声，应该是直接抛弃了这个世界的吧。他如果反抗点，如果恨或爱，都是和这个世界有关系的。但他的无声，他和这个世界，彻底没有关系。看都不看。无声，沉默，与这个世界毫无关系。啊～～～
这是比恨比爱都更决绝的处理方式吧。无声，沉默。我主的国不属于这个世界。

不要觉得没挣钱的人就是没挣钱。不要想当然，而是要实际的算一下。Jan 20, 2021 11:20:49 PM，想到打工的学生，想到我没打工。想到他们3年假期都打工，能换到一年的语言学费吗。再说了，如果真的一年能学好，这么聪明就更不应该浪费时间打工了。我是没挣钱。但拉个表格算下加法减法，才能知道谁挣的更多。
当然，如果不学习，那自然，挣一毛就是一毛。可是，只有钱的人生，不更是无比的贫穷吗。不过，大家都是玛门的信徒的话就没啥了。其实我就是安慰自己。。。还好，耶稣也没挣钱。但谁比他的工作更有价值呢。挽救全人类的灵魂啊。一个灵魂过于全世界的。
感谢上帝赐下新冠。保守着我能读完神学。。。Jan 20, 2021 11:59:04 PM，想到这个假期要回去的，都看票了。就是，一看那票价，以及前后要准备的各种手续，唉呀，神拦阻了我任意妄为的路。。。神使我继续读神学。。。

十七岁来北京读书，生于南方的她普通话不标准，家境也不富裕，很自卑。

每天五点钟起床，五点半坐在教室里，打饭只打半份，节省时间用来学习。

等到七点半开门，就会跑到琴房去练琴。

没有精彩的学校生活，没有爱情，只有刻苦的训练。

多年以后的龚琳娜想到那段日子，还是会忍不住流泪。

我们只看到对方光彩夺目的一面，却没看到过他们在背后为此付出的汗水与泪水。

如果我们连早起、忍受寂寞、坚持锻炼身体、认真吃饭不看手机这样的事情都做不到，我们又怎么去掌握自己的命运？怎么去实现自己的梦想？

每个人对成功的定义都是不同的，我不能说只要你有了钱权名利，就会幸福。

但我相信，你会喜欢那个更好的自己。


作为第二勤快的人。Jan 21, 2021 11:30:13 AM，想到做饭，想到贵哥，我，蒙恩，一个比一个懒的时候，想到，干嘛比懒呢，比勤快多好（听）。嗯。。。

05. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who cannot accept criticism from others will not be successful in work.

In this highly competitive society, it is difficult for individuals to succeed without cooperation with others. Learning to get along with colleagues, including how to deal with criticism from others, has become a necessity for every worker. This phenomenon triggers an interesting discussion: does the ability to accept criticism have anything to do with career success? As for me, people not good at taking criticism from others are unlikely to be successful. My reasons and examples are given below.

Firstly, one's refusal to accept criticism will make a negative mark in people's minds, isolating himself in a group. It is because people tend to prefer those who are modest and willing to admit mistakes and correct them. That is to say, a stubborn person who refuses to improve himself will gradually lose assistance and support from his colleagues. My friend Ben is a good case in point. He has changed jobs frequently and found it hard to settle down. Having known him for long, I can tell the reason why: he always has a backlash against criticism from others, and thus no one feels good to work with him.
refusal拒绝   backlash强烈反对 反冲；反作用   
In addition, criticism from others can stop one from going in the wrong direction. As a proverb goes, outsiders see most of the game, which means one cannot realize his or her own problems that are obvious to others. If we are criticized, it is a good opportunity for us to get rid of the shortcomings and become better persons. In contrast, escaping from  criticism blindly makes things even worse. Let's imagine a dictatorial boss, who cracks down on different voices everywhere inside his company. He wants to manage the company all by his way, but this method will definitely accelerate its collapse.
dictatorial专制的，独裁的   crack down严厉打击；制裁；镇压   
Admittedly, I am denying the advantage of sticking to oneself and refusing to take criticism. For instance, one can fully carry out what he believes without being influenced by others. However, the person who always ignores others' criticism play a negative role in building an effective team as well as harmonious work environment. So sometimes we just need to sacrifice personal benefits for collective interests.
collective  集体完成（或进行）的，集体的 
To recap, refusal to take criticism can put one in a tough spot at work. According to Chairman Mao, the builder of PRC, "Modesty make people progress while pride makes people lag behind." Accepting criticism from others is an expression of being modest, which is an important quality to help one achieve an incredible success with career.
recap扼要重述，概述；总结，概括   tough坚韧的，坚固的 严厉的，不妥协的  Chairman委员长；总裁；主席 （自1949年）中国共产党主席  PRC 中华人民共和国 modesty谦虚，谦逊，谦恭   lag落在后面   incredible 难以置信的；非凡的  


06. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The most important investment of a company is to improve the work skills of the employee.

A company always has a variety of investments to make for its own development. Some are conducive to the expansion of its business while some are aimed at promoting its employees well-being. It is argued that employees' work skills are central to a company's development, which deserves the most funds. From my perspective, this assertion is biased because there are at least two other critical invest projects. I am going to elaborate both of them in the following paragraphs.
conducive有助于…的；有益于…的   central中心的，中央的   assertion 断言，语气肯定的话  biased有偏见的  critical批评的；意见相反的   
One critical investment a company can make is to enhance employees' sense of happiness. This kind of investment is essential because whether employees are happy or not concerns their productivity and creativity. If a worker has been working with a negative mood for long, his motivation, enthusiasm and morale will gradually wear thin, which eventually harms the interests of the company. For example, I once read a piece of news that a big construction company in China fell bankruptcy, because it not only always made its employees work overtime, but also withheld salaries-those practices are like digging its own grave.
enthusiasm热心，热忱，狂热   morale士气，精神面貌   wear thin变薄；磨薄  fell fall的过去式 practice 惯常做法，惯例；习俗  
Another significant investment is to bring along talents. Undoubtedly, human is the key factor to the success or failure of an enterprise. We can see that even the best companies in the world never slack off in looking for top talents. For a company the wants to build a long-term competitiveness, one of its most important strategies is to seek the right persons. Baidu, one of the best Internet companies in China, is a good case in point. Not long age, it heavily invested in recruiting Andrew Ng to be in charge of the company's new project, who is the creator of "Coursera" --the world famous online learning platform.
bring along带着  talent有天赋的人   slack off偷懒 怠工 long-term长期的   recruit招募，征募  Coursera  
Admittedly, I am not denying the necessity of improving employees' work skills. As we all know, skillful workers are the premise for high productivity, which helps increase a company's profit margin.Nevertheless, the assertion that to improve the work skills of employees is the most important investment seems too arbitrary and unilateral, for other kinds of crucial types of investment, which can also play a key role in the development of a company, are ignored.
premise前提；假定，假设  主张；假定  margin 边，边沿，边缘 余地 盈余，利润  assertion 断言，语气肯定的话  arbitrary随机选择的，随心所欲的，无理由的，无系统的   unilateral（行动，决定）一方的；单边的   crucial 决定成败的；关键性的  
In a word, to improve employees' work skills is important, but it is not the most important investment. It is because a series of investment projects are equally important to the development of a company, including enhancing employees' sense of happiness and introducing excellent talents as mentioned above.


07. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people were in the past.

As is known, young people have been a driving force to social process. They are dedicating their vigor and aspiration to make the world a better place. But some people claim that in this money-oriented society, young people become less likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world. In my opinion, it is just the other way around, and modern young people show more passion about changing the world.
vigor 同vigour体力；精力  aspiration愿望，抱负   money-oriented金钱导向的  
First, the Internet furnishes young people with information to improve the world, which help open their minds. In the past, without Internet, young people were hardly exposed to what was happening around the world. Thanks to the development of Internet, young people are given a possibility to understand what the world needs and what they can do for it. For example, an activity called " ALS ice bucket challenge" drew a worldwide attention. Numerous youngsters shared their pictures of doing the ice bucket challenge on social media, which aroused more public awareness of the disease called ALS.
furnish为某人提供（某物）；  ALS  抗淋巴细胞血清 bucket 桶，水桶，吊桶  arouse  唤起，激起
Secondly, the transformation of teaching methods allows young people to think more about what they can do for the world. Teachers no longer ask their students to only focus on academic performance, but try to encourage them to think more and do more for the society.
transformation 彻底的改变，巨变，改观  
Thus, those young people are inspired to think of good ideas and carry out them to change the community. Taking my brother for example, as a beneficiary of school's education of environmental protection, he started an activity last year to cleanse the environment by picking up cigarette ends on streets. This practice soon gained supports from his classmates as well as students from higher grades.
inspire激励，激发，鼓舞   beneficiary 受益人，受惠者 cleanse彻底清洁  对某物（尤指皮肤）的清洁
Admittedly, I am not denying what young people in the past did to change the society. Since it has always been human's pursuit to build a better world, good people and good deeds were not uncommon in the past. However, decades age, teenagers were demanded to strive for better grades at school, leaving them no changes to come up with ideas and practice them to improve the world. Plus, due to the limited ways of communication, it was hard for some activities to organized.
uncommon不平常的；罕见的    
From what has been discussed above, we can draw a conclusion that young people  today are more willing and capable to invest their time and efforts in improving the world. The more society develops, the lagers number of young people will be awakened to devote to making the world a better place.

08. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Compared with the ability to make new friends easily, the ability to maintain friendship with a small group of people is more important and decides your happiness.

As social creators, human beings cannot live without friends. old friends can make an emotional reliance while some newly made friends are ingredients spicing up our lives, Thus, a heated debate has arisen about which following ability to make a lot of new friends. As far as I'm concerned, the former ability overweights the latter one. My reasons and examples are given below.
creator创造者；创作者   emotional感情的，情感的，情绪的   reliance 依赖，依靠；信任，信赖  ingredient配料，原料 成分，因素   spic up  spicing 香料调味, 加香料
Firstly, the friendship with a small group of people is more solid and stable. In our lives, we have known many people for social purpose, and most of them are no more than "situational friends." who just come and go. Taking my father for example, he is a salesman with complicated social connections, who has to show up in all kinds of social occasions, but he told me that he could not even remember his new friends' names. Thus, in this sense, I would rather spend time maintaining the relationship with someone I really trust.
  
Secondly, maintaining the friendship with a small number of people can bring long-term benefits to us. With limited time and attention, we are unlikely to keep a large circle of friends and invest emotionally in each one of them equally. On the contrary, if we take good care of a couple true friends, they will also treat us sincerely in return. For example, I have several congenial friends, who hold the same values as I do. Every time I feel confused and disappointed about my life, their comfort and encouragement always make me full of energy.
emotionally感情的，情感的，情绪的  congenial志趣相投的；情投意合的  适意的，合意的，相宜的  
Admittedly, I am not denying the importance of making new friends quickly. In fact, this kind of ability does have its value. For instance, when you are in troubles, new friends could probably help you out if they happened to be useful. However, in most cases, if a new friends helps you, he or she must want something back from you. It's like a deal. Besides, the relationship with new friends is not stable, because it has not experienced the test of time.

To put it in a nutshell, the ability to maintain old friends outweighs the ability to get to know new people. As a famous quote goes, God gave us relatives, but thank God we can choose our friends. Truth be told, the quantity of friends does not matter. What really matters is the quality of friends.

09. Do you agree  or disagree with the following statement? It is important for everyone  to know about what is happening around the world even though the events have not affected our daily lives.

Thanks to the progress of technology, modern people are capable of knowing about almost everything happening around the world quickly and timely. Some people claim that it is pointless to learn about the events without direct connection to us, while others believe we would better grasp all kinds of information regardless of whether it affects our lives or not. As for me, I prefer the latter perspective, and I am going to discuss about it by the following two cases.
grasp抓牢，握紧  
For students, knowing about global news is beneficial for their  overall development. Even though some news does not have anything to do with their lives, the process of gaining them can be a real eye-opening experience, which broadens students' horizon and deepens their understanding of the world. My cousin is a good case in point. Her installed a satellite TV at home so as to encourage her to know more about the world. Having watched abundant global news on BBC or CNN, my cousin has expanded  her scope of knowledge. I am often amazed by her opinions on global issues, which are more insightful than that of her peers.
scope范围，领域  insightful 有 洞察力，洞悉力 的 
For adults, grasping worldwide events allow them to make better decisions. It is because a seemingly irrelevant event is likely to have an impact on our lives in a roundabout way. For example, my uncle is a businessman who owns a gas station. In 2003, when he learnt that the US might use force against Iraq, he predicted that the price of oil would soar in a short period of time. Thus, he timely purchased a great deal of oil at a low price, which helped him make a good fortune after the breakout of the war.
seemingly 表面上；显得 好像  irrelevant不相关的，不相干的  roundabout绕道的   learnt learn 的过 soar高飞；翱翔 剧增  
Admittedly, I am not saying that we should be mindful of everything that is happening in the world, given the limitation of our time and attention. Spending time on a sea of information would distract us from doing what we should do. However, the value of information cannot be overestimated. Therefore, we can take advantage of leisure time to browse news. Also, we need to learn how to select the news that is meaningful to us.
overestimate过高估计；过高评价   meaningful有意义的   
To sum up, it is essential for everyone to know about worldwide happenings even though they do not affect our lives. No matter kids or adults, those who are sensitive to what is happening around the world will occupy a vantage point in competition.
vantage 有利地位；优越位置  
10. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.
essential 必不可少的；绝对必要的；非常重要的  
As modern world becomes increasingly complicated, young people are required to be versatile to achieve success in their life or career. Thus, people are beginning to discuss about which abilities are essential for the young generation. Some people point out that the ability to plan and organize plays a fundamental role in helping young people survive this highly competitive society, and I believe this without a doubt. My reasons and examples are given below.
increasingly增长；增加；增进；增强   versatile多功能的；多才多艺的   
To begin with, the ability to plan keeps us from losing ourselves in endless tasks. As is known to all, today's young people have to deal with far greater number of tasks than people did in the past. If one lacks the ability to plan, he would drown in tons of jobs, because things keep popping out  all the time. Taking a modern college student for example, he usually has plenty of work to do, but time is always pressing. In a short period of time, he may have to handle a term paper, earn extra credits by playing the role as a teaching assistant, and search for an internship program. Under such a circumstance, a good plan can clearly help him allocate his time and energy well, which guarantees an efficient accomplishment of all the tasks.
pop发出砰的响声  pop out砰地一声出来 匆匆出去 circumstance 情况，条件，形势，环境  accomplishment成就；成绩  完成；实现  技能 造诣；才能 
In addition, the ability to organize enables young people to make better use of accessible resources to help them achieve goals. In modern world, one cannot achieve anything without resources such as social connections , funds or information. More importantly, these resources only work when being integrated together in a proper way. For example, my cousin, the head of a college photography club, has made his club very popular among students, which is exhibition on campus. Before that, he mobilized every member to pitch in for this activity, and settled the finding some sponsors outside the campus.
accessible可到达的；可进入的 易得到的；易使用的   integrate使结合；使合并   mobilize动员；鼓动  动用；利用  pitch in 努力投入工作 帮助某事；捐献
Admittedly, I am not denying the fact that there are other important abilities that young people should possess: the ability to express themselves, the ability to make new friends, or the ability to empathize with others. However, as I mentioned before, the ability to plan and organize plays a fundamental role in young people's lives or work. The two essential abilities are like the cornerstone on which other abilities are built.
empathize有同感，产生共鸣；表示同情   
From what has been discussed above, we can draw a conclusion that the development of the ability to plan and organize is of vital importance to young people at present times. It is because the ability to plan improves our efficiency of handing tasks, and the ability to organize helps us optimize the use of resources around us.
vital必不可少的；必要的 身体的重要内脏，维持生命的重要器官  optimize 优化；充分利用
