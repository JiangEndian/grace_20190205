11. Do you agree or disagree with the following  statement? People often buy products not because they really need them but because others have them.

China's economy is taking off, which brings a lot of benefits to its people including a great increase in their purchasing power. In recent years, people have become keener on buying things than ever before. Thus, a heated debate has arisen among the public about the cause of people's growing passion for shopping. The way I see it,  following suit is most likely to be the very factor that drives people to purchase. I am about to justify my viewpoint by discussing two typical cases.

The first case is the zeal for buying electronic products. As we know, the rapid development of science and technology keeps people updating their electronic products all the time. Those equipped with latest versions of high-tech gadgets are labeled as tasteful and an fashionable icons. In order to be like that, people, especially the young, tend to follow trendy individuals-to buy just exactly what they have. For example, whenever new iPhone came out in the market, there is a fever of purchasing all over the world. Of course, people do buy iPhones to facilitate communication. but they probably more want to catch up with the times.
trendy时髦的，赶时髦的 facilitate使（行动，过程）更容易；推动，促进；便于 
Finance products are the other good case in point. Under most circumstances, due to the lack of a clear idea about how to buy financial products, people are inclined to follow the footsteps of others, considering that this is an effortless way to do about their wealth. In stock market, there are a multitude of amateur investors like senior citizens, or some illiterates. They neither spend time studying the trend of the market nor investigate what's going on with the listed companies, and they do nothing but to follow some so-called professional ones to buy stocks.
Finance财政；金融 incline倾向于，持…意见 amateur外行 业余爱好者 illiterate不会读写的，不识字的 
Admittedly, I am not saying that people buy products without any practical purposes. It is impossible for people to buy something useless, and the practicality of what they buy is always their NO.1 concern. However, if we analyze the deep motivation of consumers when they shop, we can find that they are more likely to buy something that others have already had,  because nobody is willing to be Guinea pigs to any new product.
Guinea pig豚鼠，天竺鼠  供实验的人（或物），实验品  
To put in a nutshell, people buy products not because they really need them but because others have had them. Owing to the limitation of room, I am unable to give more cases, but  believe that the above-mentioned electronic products and finance products have already proven the validity of my viewpoint.
Owing to由于；因为 validity确凿性 


12. Which factor influences you the most when it comes to a major purchase? 1) recommendations from your friends or colleagues; 2) information from media; 3) salesman in the market.

When it comes to purchasing expensive goods, people are inclined to think twice. They are most likely to be influenced by information sources from friends and colleagues. from media, or from salesman in the market. In my opinion, among all those factors that will affect them, friends or colleagues' recommendations play the most important role in helping people make the final decision. I am going to elaborate my point of view in the following paragraphs.

First of all, friends and colleagues are more sincere to us. When giving us information about a certain product, our friends or colleagues tend to share with us their true feelings about it. In contrast, TV commercials and salesmen may well brag about the quality of the product, so as to persuade us to pay the money as soon as possible. For example, if I pay to purchase a car in a Automobile 4S shop, the salesperson will usually lure me to buy a more expensive one with all kinds of coupons and gifts. However, if I resort to a friend who knows cars well, he will guide me to buy the one much suitable for my situation.
lure引诱，诱惑；诱骗   resort 向…求助；采取，诉诸  
In addition, friends and colleagues provide us with more valuable information about the product. On no account could they give us useful information about a product without the experience of using it, Thus, they must have a deep understanding of the product in terms of its quality, function and value. In this sense, their advice is more worth considering. Taking myself for example, I have been very satisfied with the computer that was bought the other day. Except for its reasonable price, its performance far exceeds my expectation, which is attributed to the recommendation from my friend Jack, who has already had one.

Admittedly, I am not saying that recommendations from friends and colleagues are absolutely correct. It is because they may have their personal preferences when buying the goods, and therefore what they recommend to us may not be perfectly fit for our one situations. However, as long as we are fully aware of our true needs and avoid following others' footstep blindly, there will be nothing to worry about.

In conclusion, when it comes to a major purchase, I prefer to turn to my friends and colleagues for recommendations or advice. It is not only because their words are more reliable but also because their information can help us reduce the risk of making false decisions.

13. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Rather than help children with schoolwork, parents should encourage kids to work independently.

There is no denying  that education has become one of the most important expenditures for a family. Not only do some parents try to provide their kids with premium educational resources, but also they involve themselves in kids' doing their schoolwork. The practices reflect the so-called "poor parental love," which is also a widely observed phenomenon. However, I choose to stand on the opposite side of it. My reasons and example are given below.
expenditure花费；支出   premium 加付款；加价  高级的；优质的 
First of all, doing schoolwork independently deepens students' understanding of that they have learnt in school. Given that knowledge can only be absorbed through repetition, schoolwork provides a perfect opportunity for students to review and repeat things they have learnt. If someone else gets involved in the process, students will fail to complete the absorption and digestion of the knowledge. Imagine that a father, who is good at math, often helps his daughter with her math homework. Even though the girl's homework is perfectly finished, her math teacher will not be able to measure how much knowledge she has grasped.
absorption（被）吸收；（被）合并   
Also, encouraging students to do schoolwork all by themselves contributes to their overall development. Without the help of others, students have no choice but to deal with tasks assigned by teachers on their own. In the process, they will gradually learn to think independently, search for materials in library and turn to someone else for help when encountering unexpected problem. My cousin serves as a counter example. He frequently asked his parents to do the homework for him, leading him to become lazy and dependent. Consequently, being short of necessary academic abilities, he failed in the exams many times and may not graduate.

Admittedly, I am not saying that parents should pay no attention to their kids' homework. In a sense, parental participation does have some advantages. For instance, since some kids lack self-discipline, parent's supervision can effectively prevent those kids from being easily distracted by something else. However, parents are highly advised not to interfere with the process of kids' doing their homework. Otherwise, kids would be deprived of the opportunity to grow up academically. 
academically （与）教育和学问（有关）的；学术的  
In brief, it is out of question that parents should encourage their kids to do the schoolwork independently. From the past to present, study has always been an individual's own  business. As an integral part of your study, schoolwork should never be done by someone else for you.
integral必须的；必要的；基本的，基础的   


14. Which do you prefer? Some People would like to upload pictures and other information on social networking websites while others do not like to create such records.

As Internet technology advances at an accelerating rate, social networking is no longer a fresh word to modern people. Allegedly, net citizens all over the world upload a sea or information onto various social networking websites every day. This phenomenon triggers a heated debate on whether it is proper to create personal information on social media. Personally speaking , there is nothing wrong with this practice. Instead, it brings lots of benefits to both individuals and society. Reasons and examples are given below.
allegedly据称地,据传闻地,依所申述地  scene场面 
For individuals, uploading personal information on social networking websites is an important way to enhance interpersonal relationship. Inarguably, we will feel it is interesting to learn about what is happening to our friends by browsing information they have posted on social media, including texts, pictures, and videos. They must feel the same way then checking out ours. This kind of interaction shortens the distance between friends, even between strangers. Every time I travel to a beautiful place, I will take many pictures and post everything I like about it on Twitter and Facebook. Minutes later, I will receive lots of my friends' comments ,which is indeed an effective social interaction.
inarguably unarguable 不容争辩的，不容置疑的 effective能产生（预期）效果的，有效的  实际的，事实上的 
For society, positive information posted onto social media encourages more people to take actions to make the world a better place. With the help of social networking, a tiny good idea coming from an individual stands a fair chance to spark up the whole society's passion. Recently, starting from unknown sources, an activity called "smile challenge" has dominated Chinese Internet environment. The activity demands participants to post the pictures of the challenger's smile and their own smile online and pass the challenge on. Aiming to arouse the public 's awareness of children suffering from cleft lip and palate, this activity soon get support from all walks of life.
tiny极小的，微小的   spark发出火花（或电火花） 点燃 激励；触发  pass on 传授；传递 继续下去；前进 cleft lip唇裂（常伴有腭裂）
  palate腭，硬腭  walk of life 行业，职业；地位 
Granted, uploading personal pictures and other information on social networking websites can have some downsides. For instance, the security of our personal information will be put at risk, since our home address and telephone numbers may be exposed unconsciously. However, as long as we pay extra attention to what we decide to upload and make sure that the information does not involve anything related to our or others' privacy, there is nothing to be worried about.
granted 诚然；确实 （用来引入一个和主要论点相反，但并非很有说服力、不能驳倒主要论点的因素） 
In short, it is totally appropriate to upload pictures and other information onto the social networking websites. Facing the advent of the age of social networking, we should learn to embrace it instead of running away from it, even though minor problem minor problems do exist.
appropriate适当的，合适的，恰当的
