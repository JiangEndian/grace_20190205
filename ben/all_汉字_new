Today is Wednesday, the class is professor Kim’s.

Before class, we worshiped the LORD, by voice, and most importantly, by our heart,  for God doesn’t see as man sees, for man looks at the outward, but Yahweh looks at the heart.

Our class started with one Hebrew verse, the book of Obadiah, chapter 1, verse 1, and our professor required us to memorize a part of this verse.
Obadiah 1-1 חֲזוֹן עֹבַדְיָה כֹּה־אָמַר אֲדֹנָי יְהוִה לֶאֱדוֹם
If we have the authority to disdain those illnesses, how can we respect those poor? If we dislike the bad smell of our brother, how can we welcome our Lord Jesus Christ who was born in a manger?

When our professor was asking us how many times the Hebrew word “day” occurred, I counted the word “day” in Chinese version, and replied with doubt, 8 times? Thus our professor said 8 times. Afterwards, I opened the original language parsing function for one verse which has one word of “day” in Chinese version, but in Hebrew version, the word “day” occurred 2 times. I was wrong. But it seems our professor doesn’t care about this too. So it’s not important for his class, but he just needs a student who is willing to communicate with him in his class.

Our professor gave us one more verse to memorize, the book of proverbs, chapter 16, verse 18, “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.”

My haughty sister started to be humble after she read the above-mentioned biblical verse, she is better than me, even though she started to be humble, how can I don’t. I shall be humble for my God is the most high one.

If he uses himself and money to attract others, how can he determine who loves him because of not money but himself? I give others gifts, and they like me, how can I know that he likes me or only my gift? Why doesn't God attract us by money? He let us like him because of himself, not others. I was thinking above written things when I was seeing that all of us students like our professor though he doesn’t bring food to us everyday.

He attracts us first by the tools of flesh, then he lets us know that we are not living on bread but his word. We are attracted to his word after we get to know his word. The word started with a sign, like a mother feeding her children at first, her children were attracted by her food, but afterwards, her children decided to love her not by her food but by herself, herself means her solidified history which was filled by her love, and support for her life.

The book of Jonah exemplifies the miraculous power and supremacy of God over his entire creation.
