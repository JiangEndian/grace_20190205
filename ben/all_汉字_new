Stop saying everyone is beautiful. There is a chance that even if you’re not beautiful like the above people, someone finds you attractive. Yes, I find some really odd- looking guys attractive. I’ll admit this. I’ve had four of five people in my lifetime squint at me long and hard and say “you’re really attractive”. But I know that I’m not the kind of pretty that everyone finds pretty.

Stop telling young girls and boys that they are beautiful to give them some sort of shallow self-esteem boosts, but instead teach them that it doesn't really matter. Teach them to treat everyone equally.

Teach them to not let someone’s appearance be the sole factor in their judgement, that good looks can never replace good manners, and that good looks don’t ensure you happiness, peace of mind, or a sense of fulfillment. Groom kids to be kind and to find beauty in everything, but also strong enough to bear it when someone doesn't find them beautiful.

I'm working until today, and I'm out of the office from tomorrow. I worked really hard to serve you with love. I'm so sorry if there's a student who's hurt by me. And now you can call me as a close brother/friend/brother. I'll be in Yeongdo, so feel free to contact me whenever you're hungry or want to hang out. Lastly, I love you so much ♥ Shalom ♪

I used to think that crocodilians were just large reptiles that ambush their prey when it approaches the water and eat it. When you dig a little however, you find a highly complex and advanced animal.

They can't just die out of hunger, because they will slow their metabolism and endure for months. Additionally, they have been observed using branches as tools, in order to lure birds. This behaviour is deliberately done, as it is only observed during spring, when the need for the construction of the nest arises.

They can't just die when they lose a limb because their body prevents the spread of possible diseases and infections and completely heals.

They can't just freeze to death, even though they're ectothermic, because they will stick out their nostrils and continue living frozen, for even a week, by adjusting the flow of oxygen in their bodies. It's called torpor. (only alligators however)

They can't just get sick by bacteria found in the environment and food because their immune system is unparalleled. So much so, that scientists want to use it to prolong our lives. It has been observed that the immune system of crocodilians is extremely advanced. During an experiment, when human blood was exposed to 23 strains of bacteria, it managed to exterminate 8 of them, while crocodile blood easily annihilated all 23 strains!

They can't just miss their prey frequently because they have sensory organs (ISOs) that detect pressure changes in the water.

They can't just die out of dehydration because they have glands that control the absorption of salt. (most big crocodiles but mainly Saltwater crocodile)

They can't just drown when they attempt to swallow their prey because they have evolved an organ (palatal valve) which seals their esophagus and trachea/windpipe to prevent flow of water.

Note: Thank you everyone for reading and upvoting this answer. In less than a week, it climbed up to 10,000 upvotes and previously I didn't even imagine my answers surpassing 1,000 upvotes. I am very satisfied with the great responses, they make me believe that many have changed their opinions about this amazing predator and now admire it more.

In fact it’s described as ‘king of beasts’ in scripture: “There is nothing like it on the earth, A creature made to have no fear. It glares at everything that is haughty. It is king over all the majestic wild beasts.”

Hello! I gave you the national health insurance information before. The National Health Insurance is personally notified of the insurance notice and has to be paid personally. However, private insurance coverage is also necessary for the safety of our international students. Therefore, I would like to proceed with private insurance collectively for students' convenience. Private insurance is about 55,000 won ($50) per year and 4,500 won per month. The part where the national health insurance is not guaranteed can be guaranteed. 
collectively集体完成（或进行）的，集体的 
The reasons why private insurance is needed separately include death due to injury or illness, domestic hospitalization costs, and any possible MRI(magnetic resonance imaging) examination costs. And most of all, if you cause damage to other people's bodies or property, you can apply. So the international exchange team thought that private insurance was also necessary for our international students. We want to maintain the private insurance that we have signed up for at a low cost of 4,500 won a month, so please be aware of it. We will guide students who need to be renewed later.If you have any questions, please contact me personally.Good evening. Thank you.

Frederick very early in life acquired a knack for leading men. It helped that he inherited a huge military and an extremely militaristic culture. Frederick quickly turned the Prussian army into one of the most formidable forces in Europe. Unfortunately, Frederick was still human and he did make one very big mistake. He started the Seven Years War.
