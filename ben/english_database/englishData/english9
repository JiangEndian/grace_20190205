"My daily schedule as a dental hygienist is a little complicated.
That's because it's different everyday.
Monday, I don't go into work until late in the afternoon.
So I have time to spend, most of the day, doing washing of clothes, shopping, and my banking.
I leave for work around four o'clock in the afternoon.
I work from five to nine PM.
Tuesday, I wake up at six thirty AM and leave for work at seven thirty.
My first patient is scheduled for eight fifteen.
Each patient is allotted forty-five minutes.
Lunch break is twelve-thirty to one-thirty.
I finish up at five PM and get home, at around six PM.
Wednesday starts an hour earlier. 
I wake up at five-thirty AM, leave for work at six-thirty, and see my first patient at seven AM, I also finish early on Wednesday, at twelve-noon.
Thursday is the same schedule as Tuesday... Getting up at six-thirty AM, leaving for work at seven-thirty, and seeing my first patient at eight-fifteen.
I get home about six PM in the evening.
Friday is another early start.
I wake up at five-thirty AM, leave the house at six thirty and finish up my last patient at three o'clock in the afternoon.
I like to get finished early on Friday.
That is a typical work week for me. "
"I would like to tell you, a little bit about some things I like, and then a little bit about some things I don't like.
First of all, I really enjoy exercising.
Some of my favorite types of exercises are swimming, especially in rivers in the country and in big oceans, because I like to jump over the waves.
I also really enjoy dancing.
I like dancing to American music because that's what I know best and  I also like Salsa and Merengue, which are more Latin types of music.
I also like to walk in the woods and to explore.
I like to walk through forests, and I like to hear rivers.
I enjoy meeting new people too.
I like to find out about different ways of life, what different people think, where they're from, and how they live.
Probably one of my favorite things are animals.
I really love dogs, and cats, and horses.
When i was little i always tried to talk my mom in letting me have more animals.
But usually she wouldn't.
So i think now that I'm going to have my own house, I'll try to get lots of animals.
Some things that i don't really like are rude people.
Sometimes people are not very nice to strangers, and that makes me feel bad.
I also don't really like driving.
I tend to get pretty bored in the car.
And it seems like it just takes a long time to get there.
One final thing I don't really like is waiting.
Sometimes I'm not a very patient person.
And i just like to hurry things up. "
"Hi, I'm Colleen, and I'm eighteen years old, and work part-time, at a restaurant called Chuck-E-Cheese's.
It is a restaurant for families with young children where the kids can play while the parents eat their meals.
We serve mostly pizza and sandwiches and we hold birthday parties for the children, usually between the ages of one and ten.
It is a good restaurant for families because the parents can relax while the kids have fun."
"My name is Afzal.
I'm twenty-eight years of age.
I live in East Oxford in a shared house with... Um... A friend of mine.
Her name is Sue and she is a yoga teacher.
I live there along with someone else called Dave.
And my little boy who is five and a half years old.
His name is Zach.
He lives with me for half a week and then he goes off to his mother.
She also lives in Oxford.
And he goes to school not far from where she lives.
He goes to primary school.
He likes sweets and biscuits and cartoons and dressing up.
He likes playing with water pistols and having friends round to stay.
He likes birthday parties and ice cream.
Um... My hobbies... I like music, gardening, reading poetry.
A little painting that is oil and not watercolors.
I also like to sing in the bath.
But i don't do that very often, because there is generally someone in the house.
Um, like I said before, it's a shared house.
And, uh, we all have to mind what we do.
The other day I was in the garden and I heard, my little boy asking Dave, not to leave his cigarette butts out in the garden.
He said this was because, Mrs Martin his teacher said, cigarette butts were poisonous, and the birds would eat them.
So we shouldn't do this.
Dave, who used to be a Marine, thought this was very funny.
But said that he would not leave any more cigarette butts in the garden."
"Last June i traveled to Ecuador, to visit my fiance.
I went right after i graduated from college.
So that i would have a couple of weeks to help plan the wedding.
We got married about three weeks after i got to Ecuador.
The planning, as you can imagine, was pretty crazy.
Because we only had three weeks.
So things, started, kind of falling together at the last minute.
But the last day was pretty crazy.
Because we had so much planning to do for the wedding, we didn't have much time to... Visit the tourist attractions.
But since my mom and my sister also went to Ecuador to be part of the wedding, we went to the beach which is a beautiful beach on the ocean.
And we almost went to a beautiful indigenous market, called Otavalo, but we didn't.
We uh, one thing we did do, we visited, an indigenous tribe in the city where my fiance is from.
That was quite interesting.
We also spent a couple of days walking through the city and going to little stores where they sold different, um... 
Where they sold different hand crafts that people from Ecuador had made.
Other than that... 
We spent a lot of time planning the wedding and it was very nice for me to see my mom and sister, and  for them to meet my fiance.
That was pretty much how i spent my Ecuador vacation this summer."
"For breakfast in the mornings, sometimes i have a glass of orange juice, with cereal and milk and a piece of fruit like a peach or some strawberries or a banana.
And, um, a piece of toast if i get hungry with butter and jam on it.
Sometimes I'll have eggs, scrambled eggs with... Like an, like an omelet with cheese and mushrooms on it.
And sometimes I'll just have a bagel with cream cheese and jam.
And that's my, my a basic breakfast.
My, my typical lunch is a sandwich either turkey or, a ham with cheese and lettuce and tomatoes.
And sometimes i have mayonnaise, on the bread.
And, um, sometimes i have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Uh, followed by a piece of fruit again, like plums are really good and nectarines are, yummy too.
And i love grapes.
And then i'll have a cookie, or a granola bar, or something like that for a dessert.
Um, dinner times, that's where i have my big meal.
And i love steak or hamburgers, anything that has meat in it.
I love chicken, and, then usually for a side i'll have like potatoes with a vegetable, like broccoli i love.
And then, follow all that up with desert at the end, and ice cream is my favorite food, so that's a nice dessert."
"Generally, my daily routine starts off in the morning a- at about seven, seven-thirty-ish.
I'll wake up and, sort of rise.
And start making breakfast for Zach.
Um, he'll sort of wake up about the same time, uh, and then he'll co- come.
He'll get dressed.
I have to sort of promise him breakfast first.
And then maybe a cartoon, and then he'll get dressed and sort of carry on with the rest of the day.
He'll always ask to watch television before he gets dressed.
But, if i do that then the whole, the whole routine's out of sync, and that will not work.
Um, for breakfast we normally have, puffed wheat, fruit.
That sort of thing.
Um, or organic bread with some marmalade.
We will have toast, that sort of thing.
Um, he'll have two or three slices.
I generally, tend to over-feed him.
Uh, but i think parents everywhere do this.
And in the winter time i'll, over dress him as well.
In the summer, i think i do it, um, too.
E_ we have a running battle after breakfast.
And he'll say, &quot;no i don't want to put my jumper on.
&Quot; and i say, &quot;you will put your jumper on.
&Quot; and i know when he gets to school, he'll take it off.
And he always does.
And, and then he comes out of school and he forgets to put it on.
So i know he's taken it off.
And, we go through the same thing day in, day out.
But i never stop and he never does either."
"We had property, at Huntington Lake in the high Sierra Nevadas, just outside of Fresno California.
And, it was fun meeting up there with all our relatives and, um, friends.
And we would spend a lot of time sitting on the porch, watching the animals.
There were, chipmunks and squirrels and, um, oh owls.
And... At night time the bears would come around.
But that was only in later years.
In the early years there was a dump, way up in the mountains.
And they would go there to find food.
They finally closed down that dump and the_ and in drought years, there was not much food around.
So the bears who would be hungry and they would come searching for food.
So naturally they were drawn to our garbage cans.
Hehehe.
We had a special cupboard outside the house that we kept them locked in so that they wouldn't turn them over.
But they would try.
You could hear them scratching on the doors outside.
So i didn't like to go out at night much, hehe.
But, um, we tamed the little chipmunks and they would come up and sit in your lap and eat seeds out of your hand.
And um, the squirrels and sometimes they would get in the house during the winter and make nests all over and chew up the bedspreads, and that kind of thing but, um, we forgave them."
"Hello.
My name is Anne, and i am French.
Um, i’m living in Oxford, at the moment.
Where i’m studying.
I’m doing my D.
Phil.
In law, in European law and international private law.
Um, i’ve been studying, um, in France and in U-K alternatively.
But, uh, I originally come from Paris, where I was born.
And, uh, where i’ve been living all my childhood.
And, um, half of my studenthood.
And, um, i very much like Oxford.
I think it’s a wonderful place.
The, the college, um, uh, incredibly beautiful.
But, it’s not only the architecture it’s also, the professors, um, the, the working environment, um, is amazing.
And, the, the opportunities with, uh, the libraries, um, the contact with, um, wonderful students, very interesting students.
Especially at a postgraduate level.
And it is certainly, uh, one of my, uh, richest experience as a student, being here.
I, um_ after my D.
Phil.
I don’t really know where i’m going_ what i’m going to do because, um, you can’t go really further after a D.
Phil.
As far as studying i- is concerned.
Unless i go to academia which is, um, one option.
Um, another option would be to work for organisations or, um, maybe to work for the government, um, in the legal services.
I don’t, uh, really know.
I still have two years to go and i’ll see then."
"Another of my hobbies is.
Uh, dancing.
Um, i do contemporary dancing.
As a, as a little girl, and as most little girls, i started dancing, um, when i was like six.
And, i started doing ballet, and got quickly, uh, bored because it was so stringent.
And after, two years of it, i asked to swap for tennis.
Um, but, um, um i came back to dancing in a very, uh, a strange way because i, i was doing synchronised swimming.
And, um, in this framework we started to have dancing classes.
Um, to get more flexible.
To tone our bodies.
Um, these sort of things.
Um, and to, to learn our movements and, have a sense of dance into the water that we could, gain from dancing class.
So this is how i started dancing again.
And, um, slowly i’ve, uh, danced more than i’ve done synchronised swimming.
Um, especially now, because i live in a city where there’s no synchronised swimming club.
So i only do dancing.
Now the sort of dancing i’m doing is contemporary dancing.
Which is, um, it’s, it’s, um, it’s very modern.
And it’s a_ it’s based on_ it’s, it’s dancing, but it’s not move your body sort of, hip-hop, or Michael Jackson dancing.
Um, it is not, um, either social dancing.
Um, in a sense, it’s not that it’s, it is not a social activity.
But it is a social activity, but I don’t dance with a partner.
Um, or in couple.
Um, and it is not ballet.
So this is what it is not.
Now to define what it is, is quite difficult.
Um, i should say that it’s, it’s very creative and it, it works on themes.
Sometimes the theme can be very abstract like, breathing and including, um, breathing into the movement.
Sometimes, um, it is more concrete like, working on, um, every day movement and every day, um, situatio_ human situations.
And then distorting it to make it into a dance.
Um, sometimes it can tell a story.
Um, it’s, it’s, it’s always_ it’s very, very open.
Um, it allows a lot of creativity.
And, um, it, it demands, um, a lot of openness and, uh, to be ready sometimes to, to break a very nice, uh, little routine that you’ve created to make it something completely mad.
Um, and it is a very, uh, self-challenging.
And very enjoyable."
" I am a French person.
And as a French person we are educated in ah the religion of cooking.
And the religion of food and of drinking.
Um as a result I learned very, when I was very little how to cook with my mother.
And my grandmother was an excellent cook.
Um but always the mother of the grandmother.
And um when I when I arrived in England ah there’s there’s always this myth about the French cook.
Um which ah always makes me smile a bit.
But ah because what I do I find it quite simple.
It’s just ah mixing things together and when you know how to mix things it’s just very simple.
Um however for some reason some people ah can’t do that.my neighbour, for instance, doesn’t even know how to beat an egg.
Or to whisk an egg.
And um I have to say that ah it is, i_ very enjoyable to spend some hours cooking at, in the kitchen.
I find it a very relaxing activity after um a long, tiring and stressful day.
And being in the kitchen um just cooking, relaxing, knowing that you’re going to eat something good, um basically doing something pleasurable after um a difficult day is um valuable.
And I have difficulties understanding people who just cook in five minutes.
And heat something up and then eat it in five more minutes.
And I don’t know it’s it’s not my style of life.
Um also I have to say that ah when you’re French you’re being brought up in this idea that um if you want to reach a man’s heart you do it through his stomach.
Ah so um it is a reason why it_ a lot of French girls are particularly careful with cooking.
Um it is very amusing because um there is at at the moment an ad in the newspaper for wonder bra.
Where this this gorgeous woman with a spectacular wonder bra um and which ah which says 'i can't cook, who cares.
'So it’s a bit against my ah, my way of being brought up.
But um I have to say that ah it’s true that most of my friends really appreciate the fact that i’m cooking well.
And um my flatmates, um are very happy when they come home and i’ve made, even something simple as a quiche.
And ah it’s a pleasure for me.
And it’s a pleasure for them.
And it’s also a pleasure for me to make some pleasure to other people."
"Hello, um, my name's Art.
I'm seventy-four years old and i live in a retirement community with my wife Selma.
I retired about twelve years ago from the bicycle business.
I was in the bicycle business for thirty-five years.
Twenty of the thirty-five years i ran my own business.

I worked at being a draftsman for five years and then i retired.
The retirement community i live in, uh, requires that you be forty-eight years or older.
In the community i engage in many activities, oil painting, water color painting, stain glass projects.
My major activity, however, is golf.
Weather permitting, i play everyday.
We have a golf course in the community, and since i play more often than i used to before i retired, my game is improved very much. "

Um, i'm majoring in psychology right now.
And, i hope to in the next five years, earn my masters from this school.
Um, i would like to then work at a children's hospital, with kids with, um, mental problems and, even just... Emotional problems.
Um, hopefully then i can work to get my P-H-D, um, so i can become a doctor of psychology.
Then i would like to... Hopefully get involved with maybe a partnership, in clinical child psychology, so that i can help children, to grow up to be, uh, stable and well rounded adults."

"Hi.
My name is Debra Liese.
I am from Bristol Pennsylvania originally.
And right now, I'm living in Princeton, New Jersey.
I am twenty-three years old and... I come from a small family.
I have one sister and, i, lived at home with my sister and both of my parents until recently.
Right now I am working at a publishing company, and I plan to work there for, the rest of the year at least, or at least until I can pay my bills.
And, once I am finished doing that, I hope to go to onto a graduate school.
And I am hoping it won't take me more than about a year to get to that point. "
"Hi, my name is Debra.
I'd like to talk a little bit about my family.
My, mother is a teacher, and my father's an engineer, and they're both really wonderful people.
Uh, my dad's very quiet, and I don't talk to him very much.
But... He's always been, a really stable presence in my life, and he's always been there for my mom, whenever she's needed him.
I also have two very loving grandparents, on my mom's side, who live nearby.
And I see them quite frequently.
I... Always had the good fortune of having a very close family when I was growing up.
And, we had a lot of family functions.
Um, currently I am working in Princeton at a publishing company.
And I plan to work there for about a year until I can, move on to a graduate school.
I also have a sister, whose name is Donna, and we're very close in age.
She is a year younger than I am.
And we look very similar, similarly.
So, a lot of people get us confused, and that always makes things interesting.
My mom, as I said, is a teacher.
She's a kindergarten teacher, and, um, she gets a lot of amusement out of that, it seems.
She does a lot of, arts and crafts projects with them.
And she's always cutting things out and leaving snips all over the house.
Um, she just started school yesterday, and she's pretty excited about it. "
"Okay i’m going to talk about Earless Hooichi.
Hooichi was a young man... Gifted with, uh, telling stories with guitar.
And he, he knew, uh, lots and lots of stories, about... Japanese histories, or sometimes everyday life folk tales.
And he, hoo_ he went all over the, uh, Japan, all over Japan and kept talking his folk tales with  guitar to people.
One day he went to Shikoku, where famous Heike, and, uh, Emperor Antoku died with his mother.
Emperor Antoku, at that time was only two years old.
And that was famous Genji and, uh, Heike civil war... Hooichi stayed at a temple... And, uh, relaxed.
Then he got a very distinguished, uh, visitor.
He invited him, to come to, his, uh... Castle and, uh, tell his stories to, his host- hostess.
And, uh, he told Hooichi that lady is very, very distinguished lady.
And, uh, he_ she has a little baby.
So Hooichi went there, the ca- castle.
And so... Lady was behind curtain.
But so many warriors and servants were sitting, uh, in the same room and... Expected Hooichi to start his, uh, stories.
So Hooichi played guitar.
And started talking about the war between Genji and Heike.
As his story goes by, many many, uh, women servant started crying and, uh, and  there, they cried so sad.
Hooichi kept talk_ kept telling... Genji, Genji’s, Genji’s, uh, army was so strong.
And Heike’s lord, the, uh, the Lord Heike was, uh, already killed.
So... The rest of warriors protected, uh, their lady.
And, eh, a little, uh, two years old Emperor Antoku.
And obviously, um, Lady was married to, uh, Emperor and, uh, had a baby.
So that’s why the lady’s, uh, baby's already the Emperor at two-years-old.
And then they took, uh_  they escaped to sea.
But Genji’s warriors had lots of strong big ships, and chased Heike.
And finally.. They they came to, um, catch, uh, Lady and, uh, Emperor Antoku.
And... The lady saw there’s no way she can escape anymore.
So she hold uh, her little baby infant.
And, uh, she killed herself by sinking in the sea.
Her loyal_ her warriors and, uh, other people saw it and they all followed her.
And many many people just, one after another, um, jumped in the sea and... Committed suicide.
And Hooichi kept talk_ Hooi- Hooichi talked about that story, or even the lady behind the curtain cried too.
And warrior cried, and everybody cried.
So sad.
And Hooichi kept talking with guitar.
And finally he said, uh, those, uh, people who died became, uh, little... Uh, crabs.
That’s why we have so many crabs around there, and they name it Heike crab.
And, then Hooichi finished his talk.
And then came back, came came back to his temple where he stays.
And then, uh, a priest at the temple saw him.
And, ""Mr.
Hooichi,where have you been.
You look like a dead man.""  and so Hooichi told, uh, the priest what happened.
Then priest said, ""oh no, oh no, they are ghost.
They trying to catch you.
I have to save you.
So, they are going to coming back tomorrow night.
And when you follow them, you are going to die.""  so, hehe, Priest, uh, started writing, uh, Buddhist script on his body, all over the body.
All night, he kept writing, writing, writing, writing, writing all over Hooichi’s body.
But he forgot to write, on his ears.
And then, night came, and Hooichi was sitting on the veranda.
Then distinguished big warrior, came by.
And Hooichi heard his big footsteps, zushin, zushin, zushin ""Hooichi, Hooichi, where are you.
.&Quot; and then the warrior came by him."" oh funny I don’t see Hooichi at all, but I see two ears, and I remember these two ears must be Hooichi’s.""  and he grabbed, hehe, Hooichi’s ear and, uh, took it out.
And Hooichi screamed with_ because he lost his ear.
Then the priest came by and said, ""Hooichi you are saved, you lost only your ear lobes."" "
"I like very_ i like many things.
From food, i like apple sauce, grapes, i love oranges.
Um, i used to love bananas but then i stopped, because i got sick.
Um, apples, i'm allergic to.
But i love them, because of apple sauce and apple juice.
Anyway that's foods.
I love music.
I love dancing because you move, your whole body to like one song.
And it's just wonderful.
Um, i love talking.
I can talk for hours and hours and hours.
And listening, you know, i like it but sometimes i don't don't do it too often.
Um... I love being a leader.
I love walking and_ walking fast, actually.
Um, if i wa_ if i had a team of fast walkers in my town i would join it.
But, i didn't have a team so_ um, there's so many things in the world to like...  And i like a lot of things, so_ aha_ and that, that was a few of them"
" hi, my name is Selma.
I am a first born American.
My parents were both born in Europe.
After college i got married, and i have two children.
I have a daughter who lives near by, and i have a daughter who lives over two thousand miles away, in a state called Arizona.
My husband and i visit her once a year on vacation.
I have two grandchildren, a boy of fourteen who is still in school, and a granddaughter of twenty-four, who is working.
For vacations, my husband and i also go to elder hostel.
This is a wonderful combination of a-  an adult camp, and an adult school.
There're all over the world, and they are also all over the United States.
We go to the elder hostel for one week, where we are given our, our housing and our courses and classes.
We meet the most wonderful interesting people, and they come from every place.
One of our elder hostels included visiting an Indian reservation.
The Indian reservation was in northern Arizona.
In the future, my husband and i hope that we will be able to, do many more elder hostels all over the country. "
"Hi my name's Colleen.
And I'm only eighteen right now, but when I finish my education, I would like to start a family.
I would like to, get married and then maybe three or four years later have, two children.
Hopefully one girl and one boy.
And I'll probably live, pretty close to my parents, because I'd miss them."
"Well this should, be a, a lesson i- in, in American politics, as well as, my story.
Um, came a point, when i realized, i no longer had the income i would like and couldn't maintain the home i was in and had to get out.
And my children all knew.
Unfortunately, they always knew that i could take care of myself, they didn't need to help me.
And the only way i could find a place that i could afford was low cost federal housing.
And so i started my research on the east coast where i am now.
And on the west coast where my son was.
And already said, everything's very expensive here you won't be able to find a place here.
So this geared me to the government housing where, i would be able to get something.
And i found that both, both coasts had the same problem, because this is the federal program.
I could only, go into, what they called section eight housing for the low income, very low income.
And there were no certificates being distributed for these.
So i had to go and find, a, a house a unit.
An apartment that was already assigned to section eight.
And in my travel_ i did research for close to three years on this.
In my travels i found out that there is one unit available to every fifteen applicants.
And i was advised to stop trying.
And there was no other answer so i didn't stop trying.
Then one day, i, called um_ i was told not to apply to Princeton.
Princeton is a very nice area.
I was told not to apply because it's for residents only.
And, there were long waiting lists.
And then i went through a list that i'd gotten from the state.
And there was this place in Princeton that was in, in a p- place i'd like to be, in an area i'd like to be, et cetera.
But i just didn't think, there was any point in applying.
Now one day_ i got the same list three times.
You ask for something you get nothing or everything.
And so, i looked at it again, and i kept seeing this thing in Princeton.
Finally i said to myself &quot;you're making all these calls, make one more call, what's the difference try it.
&Quot; when i called i got the director of the housing herself.
And she says.
&Quot;are you a Princeton resident.
&Quot; &quot;no.
&Quot; &quot;anyone in your family live in Princeton.
&Quot; &quot;no.
&Quot; &quot;well i'm going to send you an application anyway because, our Princeton list is short, and there's a good chance that you should get something.
&Quot; so she mailed me the application and i mailed it right back.
But the question on the application said, &quot;do you_ are you a Princeton resident.
Does anyone in your family live in Princeton.
Did you ever work in Princeton.
&Quot; now i never worked in Princeton, but I worked around Princeton.
I got assignments doing, Gallup polls, which is political research.
All kinds of research there.
There are four Gallup companies in Princeton that i worked for.
And eventually, they worked_ i worked for them as, as an agency as well.
Uh... And i said forty five years on and off.
There is absolutely no proof.
But she accepted it.
All the records have got to be gone by now, including mine.
And then... From the day she accepted the application_ the next day i went to look at another place, that said you have to come in and get_ and make out the application.
That place was so miserable that i just didn't want to go home.
I figured now i'm going to find this Elm Court, in Princeton.
And feel better when I get home.
When i got here i was amazed.
I'd been here before.
It was beautiful.
I recognized it but i never got inside.
And you'd never know that it was housing, senior housing.
Now i called and asked if i could h- have an appointment to look at an apartment.
And they made an appointment with me and i came to look at the apartment.
And the director gave the keys to two apartments to me.
And said, &quot;when you leave turn them to this woman, i'll be gone.
Um, I handed back the keys when i was finished looking.
And the next thing she says is, &quot;which one do you want.
&Quot; and they wanted me in December twenty-first and I said, &quot;no way, it's two weeks i cannot do that.
&Quot; I finally got in... In the end of January.
And they still weren't ready.
The reason being that their computer wasn't working, so that they couldn't figure out my rent.
We compromised.
She did it by hand, and here i am and i still don't know what my rent is.
But that's okay.
And, uh, this, this all happened_ at this point, uh, from the first time i spoke to them to moving in, was less than two months.
But in three weeks i had the apartment.
I've been fighting for years.
I couldn't get any place.
That's, the way it works.
And you also have to know the ropes.
You've got to remember that part.
You have to know how to fight it, and how to play the game.
Which i did for two and half to three years."
"My name is Gofam.
I'm from Hanoi, Vietnam.
I'm here in America to study politics.
My family lives in Hanoi, Vietnam.
But my father, is working in Bangkok, Thailand.
So my family now is like a triangle, with me in America, my brother and my mother in Hanoi, Vietnam, and my father in Bangkok.
My brother is fifteen years old.
He's going to high school next year.
He's a student of math.
He's been studying math since he was in third grade, and he's doing very well.
My mother takes care of my brother, she cooks, and in the evenings, they watch T-V.
I call my mother and my brother once every week.
Because telephone costs a lot of money from America.
My father works in Bangkok, and he complains a lot about the weather in Bangkok.
Because it's very hot.
It's hot all year round.
And, i was in Bangkok before i went to America, and it was just too hot.
I stayed inside, everyday.
I'm going to be in America for two years.
But i don't... I don't think i'm going to stay here any longer, because i already miss Vietnam very much.
I enjoy being here, but missing home at the same time."
"My mom and i do our grocery shopping at a supermarket called Carter's.
It's about fifteen minutes away from my house.
And it usually has the best prices.
I guess that's why we usually go there.
My mom's always looking for a good bargain.
She carries around a big coupon box.
It's probably the size of a big dictionary, and weighs about as much.
And we also always have to walk around looking for the cheapest prices.
It makes us feel good to save money when we go grocery shopping. "
"I have three children.
Jim and Judy and Jill.
Jim is now_ will be fifty-two.
He's a, family practitioner, practices family medicine, and enjoys it very much.
And Judy is the second one, is two and a half years younger.
She's an executive secretary.
Now she's in postmasters, at the Postmasters Club.
And she knits and she does a lot of things.
She has an eighteen-year-old son that keeps her busy too.
But he's, leading a life of his own now which is good.
So she can lead a life of her own.
And my youngest is the one that's, quite involved in a lot of things.
Jill, married a, a Jewish fellow who's Greek and Hungarian.
And, uh, Jill converted to Judaism before she married.
So they have four children now.
Daniel's thirteen, Rebecca is a- almost ten, Midge has just turned five, and little Nathan's about_ he was a year last November.
So i_ they live up the mountains outside of Denver, Colorado.
So frequently I go out for a period of time and, help with the children and gi- give my daughter and her husband a, a get away time.
Hehehe which is very important to a fam- a young family, to give the parents and the kids time away from each other.
So then, um, uh, my oth_ my son's children live out in California.
He is separated from his wife and, he is upstate New York and_ but I recently went out for two weeks to California, south of Los Angeles.
And, uh, spent time with my three grandchildren.
Michael's sixteen, Stephanie's thirteen, and, uh, Peter is nine.
But all these_ three of these children are adopted.
Michael was adopted when he was four days old.
And he's English and Italian, very blond, th- the strawberry blond and the light complexion.
And Stephanie is Portuguese and Italian, a very beautiful, very active young lady, and very much interested in act- in, uh, acting.
As a matter of fact she's been in one movie, a sci fi movie called Asteroid.
And, uh, Peter who's nine, well he'll be ten, is, um, very much a_ he's interested in cars and bikes and stuff like that.
But, uh, they're wonderful kids.
I just_ two weeks doesn't seem long enough but then, uh, what can you do.
I had a free trip out there from, one of the airlines_ hehe, accul- accumulated flying time so_ haha_ anyway that, um_ I like to see them as much as possible.
As a matter of fact last year I spent more time visiting my family than I did here at Old Court, hehe."
"Well i live in a low income senior housing project, uh, in a moderately large, community and, um, our complex is a two storey, um, rectangular building with a co- a lovely courtyard in the middle.
And, uh, we have lovely woodlands on the outskirts.
The deer come up to the building.
And the rabbits and the groundhogs and the birds are around.
So, it’s a delightful setting.
I would say it was a rural setting on the edge of a_ the town.
O- of course we were built, they tell us we are built on a garbage dump, but you don't notice it.
Haha.
And one th- the things that i really en- enjoy about living here are the services they have to offer.
I live on the second floor.
I can look out my window, and i_ the traffic doesn't bother me here and, uh, we have elevator service.
We have... Trash service.
We have laundry service.
We have a large community room where we have a number of activities.
We have a dining room and a, a full... Um, kitchen.
Because we do serve dinners here whe- our residents associations puts on dinners, for the residents and for_ we frequently do invite families.
And, uh, we have an activities room where we often hold art classes, and knitting classes and other types of classes.
We have_ someone gave us a kiln for ceramics.
And we do occasionally hold ceramic classes here.
And we have had creative writing classes, which, uh, makes things interesting.
And then we have speakers come from the outside.
And there is a group of  unis- Princeton_ I'll say Princeton because they have a group that i don't_ ma- maybe other colleges have it.
But this is a very special group of, young men who have their_ they sing acappella, and they are very much in demand.
They have the most beautiful voices.
So they come and put on a program for us.
We have church choirs coming, and we have_ we are very fortunate we have a woman who teaches the Suzuki violins.
And she has pupils ranging from high school down to, maybe three and four years old and the violins are made_ are sized according to the size of the pupil.
But they, put on a wonderful wonderful program.
And then we have a little tea afterwards and meet the parents and the students.
And its really exciting.
And then we have a couple of schools_ elementary schools nearby, and, uh, a group of us about a year ago, uh, visited the second grade and we, would go and help them with their re- their reading.
They would read to the_ us and we acted as surrogate grandparents.
And this is sort of a interesting thing to do too.
So it was really interesting the time that we went over.
The second graders were studying about the, uh, this tribe of eskimos.
And it was, it was just sort of coincidental because i had been to Alaska and i'd, uh, met many of these eskimos and brought back some artifacts.
So i took them over to show them to the pupils.
They were very interested in, in it.
So, um, [sigh] now as i say we do have other people coming in to_ putting on programs for us and, uh, we do good outside, we have special bus trips.
We go to Atlantic City.
We got to dinner theaters... And the_ even the university students offer dance to senior citizens.
Those of us who shake a leg can go.
Hahaha. "
"Now I want to talk about, grandmom.
I can remember, far back when I was growing up.
Going to grandmom's house and she'd be sitting in the chair in the afternoon... From twelve o'clock to three.
And we used to listen to Stella Dallas on the radio, ""Search for Tomorrow.""  and we used to watch the show ""Guiding Light.""  listen to the show ""Guiding Light"" not watch it.
Now in my years as a grandmom.
That has become one of my hobbies, to sit and watch,"" Sunset Beach,"" ""As the World Turns,"" ""Guiding Light"" which is on television now.
That is the longest running soap opera here in the United States as far as I know.
And... &Quot;Young and the Restless,"" and ""The Bold and the Beautiful.""  but it_  you can_ I sit back and I think of my grandmom, short and chubby, just like me, sitting in her chair in the corner every afternoon.
Glued to that radio.
Listening to those soap operas.
So they say things in life do come back, and it runs in the family."
"Well, i have reconnected myself with the church and, my Lord.
Due to the fact i had a very emotional moving when i went on vacation one time_ with Martha's Vineyard.
It was called Lumination Evening.
And it's a revival community.
And what they do they ha- decorate the houses in oriental lanterns.
And all their homes are like gingerbread houses.
And, after the darkness comes, the music stops inside the tabernacle.
Which is only a roof and pillars around it and a concrete floor.
No benches, you bring your own chairs to sit on inside this pavilion, the tabernacle.
And all the lights start.
The first string of lights start under the roof of the tabernacle.
And gradually all the fifty or sixty houses surrounding it, lights up, and all these Chinese lanterns and it is a very beautiful spiritually moving thing.
Now where i live i have... A minister who came here, who helped me see, Jesus and the church for what it really is.
And through him we ha- i have started up a prayer meeting on Sunday evenings in bible study.
And also we have a young lady from our seminary that comes here, and speaks to us.
And we read the bible and join in.
And we're also thinking now of starting a third night, to reading books.
And, the knowledge that you get.
And the feeling that you get about reading these things, and understanding God.
And what he gives to you in your life, and your prayers, and your_ any need that you have, you can turn to him and ask him.
And he will cleanse you and make you whole again.
You just have to turn your life over to him and he will make you a wonderful person."
"When i was growing up on the farm, i, um... Did all kinds of things musically and... Art...Fully, he-.
I liked art and drawing and, um, music.
And i spent most of my time doing that.
I got out of washing dishes because i, convinced them that if it put my hand in dishwater it would ruin my fingers for playing the piano.
Haha and i got away with it.
Hahahaha.
So consequently i did not know much about sewing.
Although my mother made all our clothes.
And, uh, when i got married i could see that i wanted more clothes than we could afford at the time.
Because we were both in college and not getting much money.
And, um, so i borrowed my mother's sewing machine and a pattern, and some material and i just thought well i'm a college person i ought to be able to teach myself how to sew.
Anybody can read a pattern, hm.
So i did.
I taught myself how to sew and, um, um, i started making clothes for my husband and me, and... My mother-in-law helped out telling me_ showing me how to tailor, coats and so forth and... And, um, my mother taught me a few things, and i eventually got a sewing machine, um in nineteen forty-nine.
And with that came.
Uh, ten free lessons.
So i learned how to sew on silk and how to set in sleeves.
So i thought i was set for life haha.
And since i enjoyed making things_ in fact my whole life, i felt if i didn't create something in one day, then i was a total failure.
So each day i had to get in, and create something.
So sewing was, um, a big help."
"I'm Louise Haffa, and I live in Princeton, New Jersey.
I grew up in Trenton, and my two daughters grew up also, in a church that was mostly Hungarian people.
And I learned to cook in their strain.
I have, uh, had a very good instructor.
My mother came from Hungary.
So as my children grew up they became very fond of those specialty dishes that she taught me to make.
And as my daughters grew up, they wished to also learn how to cook, as well as I did.
So my husband thought it would be, a very long distance to, uh, for me to phone each menu.
He took the video camera and taped, each one of the meals that I was making, and the daughters were so happy, because to this day they still use the video film that my husband made.
And that is how they learned how to cook Hungarian style."
"I'm Hungarian, and I'd like to tell you how to make goulash.
If you have, a nice piece of, uh, beef you cut it into, uh, two-inch pieces and, uh... You lightly salt it, before you put it into the hot, onion.
Uh, as you're preparing the meat, uh, you have... In a, in a large pan, slice some onion thick- thickly.
Because the onion will make a nice juice, if it's cut nice and thick.
And very little oil is needed.
And you will keep a kettle of hot water, nearby.
So when the meat has been cut up and the onion is, almost transparent then you add the meat.
Uh, when the onion is nearly transparent, then you salt and pepper the onion and you put on a generous spoon of paprika.
This will turn it like.
Uh.
Golden brown.
And you can then add just a very little bit of water.
It's important not to use too much water because you want to make this, for the juice of the meat and the onion.
So when you put in the beef, and you pu- you've turned it on all sides, then you make the flame very low, and you simmer it, very slowly and that will make the juice of the meat, uh, enhance the sauce.
Uh, as you go make sure that the juice is not boiling away or evaporating.
Just add water a little at a time.
Now when the meat is nearly done, then you cut up your vegetables, and you_ carrots, potatoes, parsley, celery.
Each of those can be prepared in advanced and cut up into, uh, pieces the size that the meat is_ has been cut up.
And then when the meat is nearly done, I'd say about an hour cooking.
Then you add all the vegetables into it.
There should be nice juice there.
If not add a little water, but not too much.
Now close it tightly because then, the vegetables will cook in the steam.
And, uh, when the vegetables are done then you have your goulash.
And you can, also add cabbage to it.
You quarter or eighth the cabbage, put that in, the last twenty minutes that you're cooking it.
And once, once the veggies are done you have a nice goulash."
"My husband called it ""Louise's Hungarian Kitchen"" because all the food I prepared turned out to be of that nature.
Uh, we all liked Hungarian food.
But my husband had a problem with his heart so he was told not to eat many fatty foods.
So in all of my cooking i, had to narrow down any of the oils or fats that, were prominent.
Because I had to cook sensibly for hi- my husband.
They use a lot of rice in Hungary.
And when they make their stuffed peppers or stuffed cabbages they mix the rice with the ground meat, and season it, and everything that you cook you add paprika to.
And this is what makes it Hungarian because that is a Hungarian herb.
And we make, the stuffed cabbage and the stuffed peppers.
Then we make chicken paprikash [Hungarian word].
Again with the paprika and it's a form of stewed chicken, that has a cream sauce and the flavoring is paprika.
They do the same thing with veal, and with pork.
And when you do it with pork you can always add the rice and the sauerkraut [German word] and then it becomes a dish called sekeli [Hungarian word] goulash which is named after the city where it was invented.
And the Hungarians are noted for all of their goulashes.
The word goulash is the Hungarian pronunciation.
And its just a matter of what is put into, the stew or the soup which caus- which creates the name of it.
If it is going to be with cabbage, then it's going to be called a cabbage goulash.
And it mostly has potatoes.
And the Hungarians are very well known for their vegetable soups because they're_ they work out in the field.
And when they are hungry they make a little bonfire and heat up their vegetable soup.
Which is full of vitamins and vegetables and gives them a nice hearty meal in order for them to finish their work out in the fields.
And then we have, of course the Hungarians are noted for their wine.
They have a very strong, uh, red wine called Bikavér(Hungarian wine).
And, (throat clear) then they have a very nice mild wine called Tojai (Hungarian wine).
And they also have some little, uh, white wines that are very refreshing.
But, uh, Hungarians like to have salad as well.
And they make salad with cucumbers.
They slice the cucumbers and slice the onions very thin, salt and pepper and paprika it.
And then they put either vinegar and water, or they can cream this, salad because it's a variety of what, you're going to serve it with.
And then, uh, their_ their tortes and cakes are fantastic, because they love to bake.
And sometimes they're baking cakes all day in the oven.
But it's well worth it.
Because everything is so tasty."
"My husband and i we got a gift from our children on our twenty-fifth anniversary.
They sent us to Hawaii.
I'd always said i'd loved to see Hawaii.
But i wanted to see Hawaii, not the commercialized Americanized Hawaii.
And that wasn't as easy as it sounds.
Um, we got there... In October, i think it was October.
Climate_ the weather was beautiful.
It's a very nice... Place to visit.
Only i was much more aware_ we all spoke the same language_ i was much more aware of what was going on.
We were walking down the street one day, and there was a guy, you could almost see him_ he was selling real estate, you could almost see the hook.
He as pulling everyone in from the street.
We went in, and he was going to sell us property, at a bargain... Fifty dollars a lot.
But he couldn't show it to me now, because it was still under water.
The water was going to recede.
This is the truth.
This is the truth.
And i said, &quot;thank you, but no thank you.
&Quot; &quot;but only fifty dollars,&quot; i said, &quot;you buy it.
&Quot; &quot;then but_only fifty dollars,&quot; i said, &quot;where are you going to put the school.
Where are you going to put the hospital.
Where are you going to put the post office.
Undergroun- un- underwater.
&Quot;  it is all underwater.
&Quot;but it is going recede&quot; he's going to prove it to me.
That was one interesting part of it.
Another thing is walking down the streets and see_ i actually picked up papayas and bananas from the floor from the ground.
That had come off the trees.
And they were delicious, better than anything i would have gotten commercially that had been sprayed with chemicals and all the rest of it.
This was good, this was right off the tree.
And then... One night we were out walking.
And nobody had ever said, &quot;don't walk under the coconut trees.
&Quot; i, and Hawaiian coconuts are big.
You never mind the Florida coconuts, you ain't seen a coconut until you have seen Hawaii's coconuts.
And that one missed me by a couple of inches.
It came right down, right near me.
Then we knew we don't walk under coconut trees.
In this country you walk under any tree you want.
What falls off from a tree here blows away in the wind.
Not coconuts.
Uh, Hawaii was beautiful, because there was a lot to see.
The water is different.
The water is very_  first of all the sand is white, pure white.
And the waves are, treacherous, the closer you get to the equator the, wilder the water is, and i had no intentions of going in the water there.
But walking along the shore i found some beautiful ch- uh, sea shells.
And, on the main island_ i mean you ma- may get two or three feet of, of, of, of  beach before you get to the water.
But the hotels are right up to the water.
That property is expensive and very good... For, for, for... Commercialism, that's about what you'd call it.
There's souvenirs_ i, we were in Las Vegas on the way to Hawaii.
Which was was was another interesting experience.
There is nothing there but sand and gambling.
And, and, i_ uh, a cousin of mine told me where the used book shops were, if i needed to find them.
But nothing grows.
If the wind blows you don't drive the car, because it is worse that rain against your, uh, um, your... Dashboard.
The sand is blinding, you can't see where you are going.
And, uh, it_ for as long as  i was there i was satisfied.
I am no one to gamble, so there wasn't that much to do.
There was a couple of things to see.
But it was the stop-off on the way to Hawaii."
"Hi, I would like to talk about, Indian food.
Um, basically I think that Indian food can be divided into, two basic divisions; south Indian and north Indian.
South Indian, by south Indian, I think I mean, uh, iddlies, dosa, samba, rasam, with chives and chutney and so on.
And north Indian, I think I mean, uh, puries... Chapaties... Roties uh, and things like that.
So, ba-, I think I'm dividing it basically based on, whether it's rice based, or wheat based.
And, in my family actually we, we_ at home we cook only south Indian food because my moth- we are from south India.
So_ but, uh, I think because of my friends and other contacts I got really_ I like north Indian food also.
So we go to restaurants, often.
To check out north Indian foods.
And I think recently the fast food chains are also growing very fast.
So, tho- those are also... Really_ I mean we go out, and eat often like bell puries and so on.
Yeah I think Indian food is something to be really checked out."
" I'm going to talk about Japanese food.
Um... I like simple Japanese food.
That consists of, uh, boiled rice,  miso miso soup, uh  miso  is, um, soya bean paste... Um, so  miso soup is a soya bean based soup, and salted pickles and grilled fish... Japanese food is supposed to be healthy food.
So I can eat lots and lots of the food I like.
But the problem is, although... Um, it is very low in fat, but very high in salt.
So when I eat Japanese food, I have to drink a lot of water... Um, apart from that it's very good, and if you have a chance, try it.
But control... Uh, control how much salt you you you take."
"I am a retired person.
I am seventy-six years old.
And I worked very hard to get to be seventy-six so I don't care who knows how old I am hahm.
I live in a complex of eighty-eight apartments.
And there's around ninety some odd people here.
It's nice being here.
I... Wanted to forget lots of things that happened in my previous life and, um, to retire here and enjoy new people.
My daughter brought me some gincoba (ginko) tablets to take recently.
She said it would help improve my memory.
And I said ""well, I don't want to improve my memory.
I am trying to forget.""   and, um, recently she asked me if I am still taking them and I said ""well when I remember"".
Hehe.
So the people here some are friendly and some are not and, uh, you learn to adjust and relax and go with the flow as they say.
Hehe.
So... I, um, I have a great big white Cadillac a nineteen ninety.
Um, it's, uh, a Grande d'Elegance.
And it's still a good car.
So I get called on to take people to the doctor or do grocery shopping for them.
Or one thing and another.
We have a little luncheon group so I am kept busy, and its fun."
"Growing up in Mississippi, we lived on, a farm.
And it was by this, large lake and it was twelve miles long in the shape of a horseshoe.
And a mile wide.
Beautiful fresh water lake.
We fished all day and haha enjoyed it.
My father raised cotton, alfalfa, corn, you name it.
And, uh, cotton was the main crop.
And some years were very good.
But there were years when it was quite a gamble.
Because he would plant the seeds, and the rains would come as they do in Mississippi and wash away the seeds.
And he'd have to start all over.
So, some years, um, we didn't make as much money as others.
We had, uh, the alfalfa to feed the cattle.
And of course there were lots of rabbits that lived in there.
And we had a friend who, had an airplane who dusted our crops the cotton crops.
And he would use the alfalfa field to take off and land, hehe.
And, um, we had a little lumber company.
My father called it the Grunt and Groan Lumber Company.
And, hehe, he would cut down trees and make boards.
Hehe, and and in fact you have to do everything on the farm.
My mother and grandmother had, recipes for how to make cold cream to, whatever.
They made everything.
And you had to make everything count.
Raised fruits and vegetables and you canned everything, even meats.
And, uh, living on a_ by a lake in the south we had alligators, and they would come into the swimming area.
And we'd just make a lot of noise and scare them away so we could swim.
Haha.
And, um, we fished all the time.
And, we had_ there was all kinds of fish there.
From gars to, um, striped bass, to white perch to, you name it.
We had soft shelled turtles.
And, um, mostly we had moccasins which were very, dangerous.
And, um, mosquitoes.
And the moccasins were_ we had to really watch out for them.
And, um, my aunt would come to visit and she'd want to seine for bait to go fishing.
And by bait i mean they were, tiny, tiny shrimp in there that were clear_ they weren't pink as you're used to seeing, but they were clear.
You could see through them.
And, um, i was the one who had to take the seine out into the, bayou, to seine for this and bring it in.
And one day we_ i came in with the seine full of, uh, baby moccasins.
Needless to say that's the last time i seined for her hahaha.
And, we used worms after that.
So_ and around the farm we had all kinds of wild things from wild grapes to, persimmons, pecans walnuts.
It was kind of a paradise.
And i miss it."
"In Florida, we lived in a, big home on Miami beach.
Uh, i was very unhappy to have lost my husband.
So i had to give up everything.
The business that we had, and the home.
And therefore i invested what money i had left, in a very charming houseboat.
I lived on the houseboat for, as many as four years.
And it was a charming way to live.
It was, almost like perpetual motion.
And it is very soothing.
And because i had been a, a sailor.
Or i used to sail, uh, it was very easy for me to be accustomed to it.
But that was one of the nicest times i had being alone.
And of course i wasn't always alone because, having a houseboat everybody wanted to see it and come visit me.
So it was always overrun with, tourists and with my friends.
But it was nice.
I enjoyed it.
It was right near the public park, by the river.
And, uh, at the public park was a swimming pool.
So in the afternoon i went over and gave swimming lessons at the pool.
It was very nice living on the river.
And every time a big steamer came by, they would throw us, things.
We was on the upper deck of my houseboat, and from the steamer, the sailors used to throw, fruit to us, from the various countries that they came from.
That's it.
That was fun."
"Okay.
Uh, my husband and I enjoyed driving from Florida to New York every year.
And, each time that we made the trip, we would take a different route, so that we could explore more of our country.
Well, one trip that we went, we were going to go by way of Dover, Delaware.
Because there at Dover you can get your_ you can take your car onto a ferry boat and sail across the, uh, bay to New Jersey, to Cape May.
And that was our point to get over there.
We happened to be first in line waiting for the, uh, ferry boat to, uh, start taking passengers.
And therefore we parked our car down below where we were shown.
And went up on deck to watch the proceedings.
As they were putting the_  filing thos- the cars on it was amazing how ,very fast they did it.
And each, each car was in its spot beautifully.
And just as they had everything filled up, all the way to the very end.
Down the road comes this little Volkswagen running for all its might to see if he can get onto our boat.
And as he came up there seemed to be no room at all.
The four longshoremen that were working on our boat hopped off... Th- onto the pier.
They each picked up one quarter of the little Volkswagen and put him on sideways so that he just fit in that little space."
"Hello.
My name is Louise and I live in Princeton New Jersey.
The apartment where I live, is called The Elm Court Apartments.
I like living here because it's like being in the country.
And in the summer time, when I draw my shade in the morning there are deer right outside my window.
And.
Its nice for me to walk around.
Because it's heavily guarded and it's very safe."
"I like music.
When i am busy i like, very peppy music with a good beat to it.
Because it, it gives me a, a big urge to get done before i knock myself out.
I also like slow music for when i'm reading.
I like background music.
And this tape with, uh, James Galway is excellent for background music.
And then, i like, waltzes.
Because I'm fond also of dancing.
When i was young i used to dance.
And i, then as i grew older i taught the children of our church to dance.
Hungarian little folk dances, that's very nice too.
But i think my greatest love is cooking.
I enjoyed raising my two daughters because, they were so easy.
They always used to say they were raising me.
But i, i like making my own clothes.
I enjoy creating something.
But most of all i think the jewelry, that i create, gives me satisfaction because i give them as gifts.
And when the people i give them to show their, uh, appreciation it makes me very happy.
And it is worthwhile because i have made many people happy.
And i_ that was doing the jewelry.
I also like to keep house.
And i, i did study painting at one time.
I am not a good painter but i did like to, g- visit all of the museums.
I enjoy reading and i read, anything that, is not violent.
And i, ,uh, i don't like to be in groups of people that are controversial.
I enjoy when we have a nice conversation but not with an argument.
Uh, i believe that any discussion can be settled without arguing.
And so i dislike when i hear people fighting or arguing and i just seem to walk away.
I don't like, um, there's some foods which i don't like.
Uh, i love pizza.
But i don't like anchovies.
I like to_ i like to do my own cooking.
And i invent dishes.
I am fond of cabbage, so i have, tried so many different ways to invent new dishes with cabbage.
And then i learned later on that somebody else has already invented that dish.
So i try, with everything.
But now... I, i'm not doing very much of anything."
"When i was a child of course we lived out in the country and, the first mail plane that flew cross country, flew directly over our farm.
And every morning at a certain time, my dad would take us out in the yard and we would watch for the appearance of this silver plane coming across the sky.
And then in the evening it returned at the same time before dark.
So every morning and every evening we would go and watch this plane streak across the sky.
Very seldom did this plane carry passengers.
It was simply a mail plane.
But it was a silver plane so it really would stand out against the sky.
And this was our first, introduction to flying when we were young.
And then every time there was... An air show at the nearby Dayton Airport, our father would take us over to watch the show.
So we were being indoctrinated at an early age.
And as i said a few_ well i was a teenager when my cousin became very much interested in flying.
And he raised cattle and he had a two headed calf and raised it to adulthood.
But he would charge_ they lived along a main highway.
But he would charge admission to see this.
And gradually he made enough money to buy his own plane.
And then he had enough money to buy another plane.
And then years later he found another two headed calf and that made enough money to buy,to build his airport you see.
And then his wife at sixty-two, learned to fly.
So we were all very much ah involved in this because we were cousins, you know so we were over their place a lot.
But, uh, this as i say, this sort of stimulated, stimulated my interest in flying.
And then during the second world war one of my older brothers became_ joined a flying club and learned to fly, learned to pilot a plane and that ended when, uh, one of the members, haha, crashed the plane in a cranberry bog, haha up north.
Hehe.
But it still didn't kill my interest in flying.
And so then on, um_ during the second world war i was.
Uh, working up in Rochester New York and, and this friend of mine and i became interested in flying.
They were offering flying lessons out at the airport.
So at the end of the day we would hitchhike out to the airport, hehe, and take the, uh, free flight ground school, uh, course and then we took flying lessons.
Well i had_ was with a half hour of soloing.
And like a stupid thing i never thought about it, i went out when i had a severe sinus infection.
I got up in the air and made, made my little flight pattern and did all right.
It was after i got down to the ground, that, uh, my ears_ my_ the tubes of my ears collapsed.
I lost my hearing, for two weeks.
And as a_ in my nursing career that was very bad.
So the doctor grounded me.
My nurse friend continued her flying and and got b_ got her pilot's license needless to say.
So i just said &quot;well if i can't, i can't but it's not gonna keep me out of the air&quot;.
So from that day on i would fly commercial planes whenever i had a chance.
I mean i would fly in commercial planes.
But then, uh, some years later when my son was in his first year in college.
He came home and he said_ he waved this little piece of paper in front of my face and said &quot;look ma.
Look ma.
&Quot; i said &quot;what do you have.
&Quot; &quot;I am one up on ya ma i got my pilot's license&quot; hehehe.
So i said &quot;hurray for you&quot; hehehe.
So he would take me up occasionally then, then, um, eventually i would say, about five years ago he, bought his own plane, a small plane it was a second hand one.
But, uh, he still flies here and there.
It's just wonderful.
But to this day i really enjoy flying.
Hehehehe."
"I think my favorite place to be all the time is_ well i was born and raised in the country.
I'm not too bi- keen on big city life.
We took a trip, not too long ago to the Poconos, up to the Delaware Water Gap and that is like, two... Mountains that come together and the Delaware River runs between them.
And yes we have a tribe of Delaware Indians that live along the river up there.
I think the reason i like the country is because i am a lover of animals.
And it just seems that it's a totally different world especially in the Fall when you go up there and in the Spring.
Where everything and the world just seems in the Spring to come back to life.
And in the Fall the colors, are such a beautiful sight.
And there's one part if you look at the side of the mountain, it looks like an Indian head.
And the trees are the feathers in his headdress.
And when you see the colors in the Fall you can actually visualize this feature.
There is like a rock, where his nose is protruding.
And it just looks like it's been chiseled out, but really it hasn't.
And [cough] i always_ my philosophy is like in the wintertime right now that it snowed last night.
And the trees are so beautiful with the snow that_ its just_ i love nature and i think its something that we should all treasure.
Because eventually the way man are building we aren't going to be able to see our forests.
Or the brooks that run along the side of the road.
Or the_ the deer running in the field because man are just driving all these natural animals out of their habitat.
And sometimes in the morning if i get up and look out my window, there's maybe four or five deer out in the backyard.
And sometimes in the Spring you can see them laying right out there at night time resting.
And i love to see different... Types of birds.
I don't like snakes.
That's the only thing i don't like is snakes.
And I can remember one time when i was, about eighteen we had a Neshaminy Creek that ran in the back of our house.
And we had a place where the kids would jump off of this mountain and we called it Mount Misery.
I don't know why.
And they had a rock that protruded out of the water that looked like the back of a turtle.
And i used to go down there.
And in the morning_ and you'd see all these beautiful colors in the sunrise of five o'clock in the morning.
What a gorgeous peaceful sight.
And i would just watch it come up, and the cast of the colors on the water.
That_ and it's just a wonderful thing.
And a wonderful way to put peace in your life.
You know, because you know your Maker has made this for you to see.
If you just take a walk one day.
Or just sit out in the back yard and look.
It's really a beautiful sight."
"Now I'll talk about my children.
They are born_ if they would have all been born on the right dates.
They would have all been born, five years, and five months to the day apart.
But my second child had to, louse it up a little bit.
Uh, he was born on_ three days later.
Now my oldest son he's sort of drifted... Across the United States when he got older.
And he's never at a lack for a profession because he is a chef.
So no matter where he goes he always finds a job where it's a short order cook.
Or a sous chef.
Or cooking in a big restaurant.
Now he's drifted to Quaker Town.
Where he goes_ he is engaged to a lovely, woman, I should say.
That's going to become a psychiatric nurse.
And he's working in a auto parts factory now.
My other son, Jeff, that sort of  threw the monkey wrench in the deal.
He is trying to start up his own business.
Which I am glad of.
He is_ he teaches also computer analyzing, and computer at one of the college_ county colleges here in Pennsylvania.
And he's also an iron worker.
Which he does odd jobs on the side as well as.
Other things.
And my daughter, she works for, a mail service, company here in Princeton.
And she's a very hard worker.
And as mothers are they, kind of, get protective over that last child and_ because that's always the baby.
And she has... A very rough job with the public.
Because when you work with the public it is very hard to handle sometimes.
But they are all... Together.
She has a nice husband.
He_ who is from Guatemala.
And the family speaks Spanish.
And... It's kind of hard when you were brought up prejudice to accept, someone from another race into your, ethnic background.
I should not say race.
But he is a very hard worker and he is a very good provider.
And I think that's all we asked.
That our children have good homes, and someone that cares for them and loves them.
And, that they are stable in their life.
And you don't have to worry about how to provide for them any more, because they have someone to do it for them.
My two sons_ Jeff is married, and her sister is engaged to my oldest son.
And, they're very lovely girls.
And from my understand there's two other girls in the family.
But I have ran out of sons, haha.
So that would be the end of the line for my sons to marry into their family and their names, the four D's, Donna, Dale, Denise and Debra."
"Okay.
The community i live in is a senior community.
And when i first came here, we have a_ its small and it takes you a long time to learn the people.
And the first activity i was stuck with was going around getting everybody's name, telephone number and their birthdays for our little directory, that we have within_ in Elm Court.
Another activity they put me into was coordinating secretary, the next term the residents association had voting for.
Which meant that i went and i greeted people.
I sent out birthday cards, get we_ get well cards, sympathy cards.
And then they talked me into becoming the vice president.
Which led into the presidency which i just, had turned over to someone else this past year.
Because it's a very hectic, and very strenuous job.
But we put on dinners to raise money for Elm Court.
And i bake for Elm Court.
My_ we wanted at one time a shuffle board.
So i went and i sold candy, three or four times to help, raise money for the shuffle board, for our activities.
And we have what we call a country store.
So now i am involved in the country store which opens up, once a month.
And we get donations from tenants, and also from their families and outsiders.
And then i resell it.
Which raises a little bit each month.
And again i bake, cookies or brownies or cakes to sell or different types of breads.
Which goes first before anything else of course.
Then, i, do crafts to sell.
I help set up for dinners that we hold here.
And i think now it's a little bit time for me to sit back and slow down a little bit, and just do for me.
But needless to say I'm still involved with activities for fundraising now.
But, that's going to be the limit to my work as a volunteer for anything here at Elm Court."
"Let's go into a little bit about my careers.
Well first off i started as a waitress.
And i worked at a diner when i was about sixteen.
And a funny incident we used to have the race track people come in, almost every other weekend.
And we had a group of construction workers that always showed up in the morning for their breakfast.
The one morning we had this waitress that came in from down south.
And we used to switch shifts on working on the grill.
It was her time for breakfast cook.
So the fellas from the construction, company came in.
And she had set up the eggs on top of the grill.
And she decided that there wasn't enough grease on the grill.
And she thought the eggs were gonna stick.
So she put a whole stick of butter on the grill.
And the next thing, you know, the whole half dozen eggs slid right off of the grill down into the pit trap the grease trap in the back of the grill.
Well that was hysterical.
Then... I moved over here to Trenton.
And i started into nurse's aide work.
Doing private duty work over here.
Where i had gotten my training from, some very wonderful people in Pennsylvania.
But most of my career has been over here.
I worked for... Private agencies.
I also worked for private people, and then that sort of tapered out.
And then i went into housekeeping, with my daughter.
But that didn't last very long.
Because we had so many big companies that were competing with the small guy.
And a lot of times the small person doesn't get ahead and successful, if they don' t have the right kind of equipment and backing.
Now i guess I'm more contented at, taking care of, people that come to me here where i live.
And they asked for favors or a little bit of help or, you know, to... Do a little bit of work for them.
If they have a ingrown finger nail i tell them stick it in some peroxide and warm water it'll go away the next day.
The infest- the infestation that's in there is really what pains that, hang nail that you have got growing along your finger.
Or if somebody needs me to pick up their mail, i'll do that for them.
Outwardly i think i'm a goodhearted person.
And i like to help people in need."
"All right.
Hi, my name is Maria.
Um, i'm a Croatian.
I'm thirty-two years old.
Uh... I live in Croatia with my parents.
And um ... And i have a brother whose is married and, uh, he has two kids.
But he lives in Dubrovnik, where i was born.
And ,uh, i lived there for fourteen years, uh, i finished there high school.
And, uh, just a year of the, uh, university.
Which i quit, uh, because i found a job in the meantime and, uh, you know, i couldn't carry on with two, two things.
Working and studying was quite hard.
Um, i live on the island which is uh, near Dubrovnik and, it's a beautiful place, it's a national park.
And, um, there are ten places, ten villages.
And just a very few, few people live there.
And um it's a, touristic place, uh, lots of foreign people come there to, to relax.
And um... Um... Uh in nineteen-ninety-two i, uh,  decided to, to travel around.
So I came here in Oxford, and i stayed for two years and a half.
And uh, after that i decided to move to Italy to... To learn Italian.
And, it took me quite long.
Ahah it took me quite a long time to lear- to learn Italian.
And now i, i speak it fluently anyway.
And i'm thinking of, going to France for, um, few mo- a couple of months probably, to learn French and, um, something about French people and French culture."
"Um, my name's Miheal.
Um, I live in Oxford.
I've lived here for four years now.
Um, I came here in 1985 to do a post graduate degree.
Um, before that i, I lived for three years in Wales.
Um, I did my undergraduate degree there.
Um, I spent most of my teenage years, um, eight to eighteen living in Dublin where my parents were.
Um, before the age of eight I lived in East Africa, um, where my father was working at the time.
Um, my mother's from Dublin.
Um, and my father his_  he was born in East Africa although his, his father, um, came from Wales to there, and he has a lot of connections and family in Wales.
Um, I've, I've one brother, um, full brother who's slightly younger than me.
And I've, uh, a half brother and half sister who are considerably older.
Um, from my mother's first husband, um, who's Swedish.
So, um, my sister lives in Sweden, and my half brother lives in Australia."
"I was once sat in a pub with some friends and, um, i piped up cheerfully that, um, my plants had started flowering.
This caused a lot of interest amongst some of my friends.
Who asked me what sort of plants.
I think they thought that i meant, well marijuana, or something.
And, and they were all a bit, uh, sort of peeved when i sai_ when i, when i confessed that they were broad beans and runner beans.
I garden and grow my own vegetables, and some fruit as well.
I grow marrows and potatoes, and carrots and parsnips.
Um, gooseberries, raspberries, um, broad beans, um, that's all i can think of off the top of my head.
Um, it changes from season to season.
There are some winter cabbages.
That sort of thing.
Cauliflowers, and in the summer there's, there's your fruit.
Uh, i_ it takes up quite a lot of time especially in the summer.
Um, i have to go out there every two, three days, if only to do the watering.
The_ it always_ there's always something that needs to be done there.
And i can find myself often, spending two three hours there without realising.
I grow my vegetables in an allotment.
That's a communal area of land that's allocated, um, for communal use.
Um, it's_ uh, dates back to some_ to, to the First World War, i think.
Or if not the Second World War.
When people used to grow their own vegetables.
And they used to have an area of land next to where they lived, for growing purposes."
"For, uh, for the moment i live i- in Italy.
Which is, um, near Padua.
And, uh, i work there as_ i, uh,  look after an old lady.
I have plenty of free time so i took up a new hobby which is painting.
Uh, i do enjoy that because it is very relaxing and, um, you... Also find out, uh, new things about your own self.
Hehe and um, i do like, um, painting still life.
Uh, then i like painting, doing paintings of, the place i live in Croatia.
Because it's very nice and, and there are few, uh, small island in front.
So it's very interesting how to paint, um, these islands and, um, the shadows on the water.
Uh, i really enjoy painting, and, uh, i paint with, uh, water colors and, uh, pencils.
I would like to try to paint , uh, with, oils.
Um, i would also like to take a course about painting.
And, uh_ because I do enjoy it very much and um i would like to do it seriously sometimes."

I've been taking piano lessons for the past year.
Dancing has also become a hobby for me, and I've been taking dance lesson, to try to get better.
My parents live near by in a retirement community.
You have to be fifty-five years old to live in that community.
I visit them, once or twice a week, and they come to me for many special occasions.
Now that my children are not so small, I hope to do what I really want to do, and that's travel."
"The ancient Romans, built a canal in southern Italy to_ in order to shorten the trip from going around the bottom of the country.
And they, dug it out of the side of the rock.
And it was very deep.
And it was beautiful blue water there.
And it was meant for the ships to cut through and save themselves almost a year in time, o- of traveling.
Well it, it took so long to build this canal that, several of the emperors of Rome_ of Italy uh, were involved.
And when it came to be Nero, Nero's turn, to see that it was, being worked, he didn't finish it.
Because during the time it was being dug in his_  for Nero.
He went to Delphi and he spoke to the oracle, and the oracle told Nero that if he finishes the, canal he will die.
So Nera_ Nero never finished the canal."
"I have, um, a two-year-old niece.
And I enjoy very much playing with her.
She loves playing hide and seek.
And, that's, um, when she looks at me and then I cover her eyes and she can no longer see me.
So she thinks i, have disappeared.
It's a great concept.
Um, I really enjoy playing with her.
She's, a, she's a laugher.
She's always laughing.
She laughs like five or six hundred times a day, it seems.
And she's a little sweetheart.
She's... A bundle of joy.
I don't really know what else to say hehe.
Um, she_ her name is Chivonne.
Uh, but, um, yeah, she's got blue eyes.
And she's a little, a little bit over weight.
But I guess that's normal for a baby.
And, I don't know, I can't wait till she grows up, to see what she turns out to look like."
"Hi my name's Colleen.
And as a young girl, um, i started playing softball when i was five.
Um, we only had about four teams.
But... We always played each other and we had a lot of fun.
Uh, it's a game much like baseball, but it's played on a smaller field, and with a bigger ball.
Um, the girls and i always had a lot of fun.
And, my dad always coached the team.
Um, as we got older, about, fourteen fifteen years old i suppose, uh, we started playing other teams from other towns.
But we always had a lot of fun.
And it was really a good time."
"All my life, i've really liked music.
And fifth grade i started playing the saxophone.
I didn't at first know what instrument to play.
Then my dad asked me, why didn't i play the saxophone.
And he showed me a picture of a saxophone, when we went to a music store.
And right from that moment i decided  i wanted to play the saxophone.
At first i didn't practice very much.
Probably about, a half hour everyday.
But then my mom got me music lessons.
And i started having good professors and i started getting more and more interested, in music.
So then i started practicing more.
When i was in high school, i actually got up about, an hour and half or two hours before i usually did, before the rest of my family, to practice.
Because i couldn't practice after school.
And this was really good for me, because it gave me time to practice but my family didn't like it, because they always had to get up early."
"In my experience children don’t get frightened,by stories.
As long as they have got a reasonable ending.
As long as the baddie gets killed.
Now this is, uh, this is quite a rye story actually.
Ghostie story, which children love.
And is called 'Poor Samuel'.
Poor Samuel.
He was in his cottage fast asleep, when it caught fire, and burnt to the ground.
And when Samuel woke up, he was dead.
And he lay there for a while feeling rather strange.
But then his soul rose up out of the ashes... And went drifting around.
Samuel, he felt strange walking around with out his body.
And he realised there were lots of other floaty things, whispering away, around him.
And he said, 'who are you.
' And they said, 'we are the wandering souls, Samuel.
We are the souls who haven’t yet been buried.
Now what you have to do Samuel is you have to get down to the graveyard, and see the big worm.
And he will get you eaten up, so that you can go back into the earth and rest easy.
''Oh, right, i, i'll do that,' said Samuel.
And he went drifting off down towards the graveyard.
And that was a dank and dark and dismal place.
It didn’t smell too good either.
And there upon a, great slab of stone, there was the great worm.
And that worm was swaying its head from side to side as though, looking for something to eat.
'That you, Samuel.
' Said the worm.
'Yes, yes, its, it is me.
''So you are dead, Samuel.
''Well yes, i am.
''And you have come here to be eaten up so that you can go back to the earth and rest easy, is that it.
''That's it,' said Samuel.
And the worm looked at him and said, 'well, where is your body.
Where is your body, Samuel.
'And Samuel said, 'well, i don’t have a body.
I was, i was burnt to ashes.
''Oh yuck.
' Said the great worm.
'Ashes don’t taste too good, Samuel.
But you go fetch your ashes and bring them here and we’ll see what we can do.
'So off went Samuel.
And he went back to the burnt down cottage and he scraped up all the ashes of what he had once been.
And he put them in a sack.
And he took them back to the graveyard, and gave them to the great worm.
And the great worm spread all those ashes out and he, felt through them and, said, 'Samuel, you are not all here.
There is a big toe missing, Samuel.
''That right,' said Samuel.
'I, i chopped it off in an accident about a year ago.
''Well, Samuel, you had better go fetch that big toe.
Because unless you are all here we can’t get you eaten up and put back in the earth so you can rest easy.
''All right,' said Samuel.
So off he went back to the garden and, he dug and he dug and he dug looking for that toe he had lost.
And he found it.
It didn’t look too good.
It didn’t smell too good.
But he took it back to the great worm and put it in amongst the ashes.
And the great worm sifted through the ashes again and said, 'you are still not all here, Samuel.
There is still something missing.
Did you lose anything else.
'Samuel thought, and said, 'why yes, i lost a thumbnail.
I hit my thumb with a hammer it... And my nail turned black and fell off, and never grew again.
''Well,' said the great worm.
'You had better go find that nail, Samuel.
We can’t have you eaten up and, put back in the earth so you can rest easy until you are all here.
You had better go find that nail.
'So Samuel went away to look for his thumbnail.
Have you ever tried looking for a thumbnail.
He looked and he looked and he looked.
And as far as I know Samuel is looking still.
So if ever... You find a thumbnail.
You make sure you get, get in touch with Samuel so he can take it to the great worm, and get all eaten up, and go back to the earth, and rest easy."
"Once upon a time... A very poor_ but with very kind heart, young man lived with, uh, uh, his wife, in a very poor village.
The village is actually nearby fishing port.
And he leave_ uh, go to sea and fishing, uh, um, fishes.
Behind his, uh, very little, uh, tiny house, there was a big bamboo woods.
There are so many bamboo, bamboo, bamboos... And, eh, uh, one day... He, he came back from sea, and, uh, ah, told his wife... &Quot;i see something shiny in the wood, bamboo wood.""  And, uh, his wife said, ""oh yeah.""  and, uh, so they looked, uh, looked back their back yard, and bamboo, uh, lots of bamboos in their backyard.
And going through the mountain.
And, then she said, ""let’s go and take a look.""  so, both went to see, uh, what really shining in the, uh, bamboo, dark bamboo among bamboos.
And, uh, then they found, uh, one bamboo, uh, very shiny and, uh, beautiful.
So they said, ""look at this, why this bamboo it is so shiny.""  and, man said,""okay, let’s cut it.""  so he_ they cut bamboo.
And, uh, they found a beautiful baby, there, girl baby.
And, uh, woman said, ""look, I found a little tiny baby here in this bamboo.""  and man said, ""oh yea, oh she is so beautiful.
Since we don’t have a baby, our babies, let’s adopt her and, uh, i’d like to raise her.""  and she said, ""yea, I love her already.""  and they picked up, uh, little girl baby from bamboo.
Baby was so beautiful.
And her skin is pink, and eyes are shiny, and very very beautiful baby.
Man said, haha, man said, ""oh I found, I found another shiny stuff.""  ""what is it.""  ""oh this is gold coin, I found.""  and so they picked up gold coin, and went home... They, they are very poor and_ but they’re_ they have very heart- warm heart, and kind gentle people.
And they gave a lots of candies and cookies to kids in their neighborhood, who are always starved.
So that, they don’t have anything to eat usually in their house.
But, a man just came back from sea so they had fish.
But they just picked up also gold coin.
And then they said, ""okay, let’s, uh, buy a beautiful clothes for baby.
And, uh, let’s you know, give her enough food, and, uh, feed her.""  so they went to town and came back with food.
And, uh, fed baby.
And they named, uh, baby Kaguya... And, uh, after that, strange things kept happening.
When mens_ when they thought, ""oh, we would like to have a nice house so that, uh, our daughter Kaguya is going to enjoy more space.""  and, then they always found shiny bamboo in the back yard.
And they go there and cut bamboo then they found, al- always gold coins there.
So they built a hou- beautiful house.
And they bought beautiful clothes to their daughter.
And, and they started living very happily.
And Kaguya became, uh, um, prettier and prettier.
And taller and taller.
And, eh, finally, she has become a teenager.
Then she started, uh, sometimes looking up the moon and, uh, crying.
So man and woman asked, ""what happened my daughter.
What makes you so sad.
.&Quot; then, Kaguya looked up, uh, her parents and said, ""dad and mum, nothing.
But I just sad, i’m just, I'm just very, very sad.""  and didn’t tell, uh, dad and mum anything why she’s crying.
And when she reached seventeen years old, her beauty, and nice gentle personality, became famous.
And, many many young men wanted to, marry her.
And they came to, uh, their house and asked, uh her, Kaguya, to be their wife, wife.
However, Kaguya didn’t want to marry to anybody.
And one day, uh, lord of, uh, that region heard about beauty of Kaguya and he came to see, uh, to see her, and fell in love with her right away.
And, so he, he proposed to her.
But Kaguya looked sad and said, ""no, I cannot marry you.""  and, uh, one day it was full moon.
And it was_ moon was beautiful, and Kaguya was looking up moon.
Then, they saw beautiful ship coming down from moon, to her.
And, uh, ship finally arrived nearby her.
Then four... Four strong, and_ warriors with dignified face and dignified manner.
And they came to Kaguya and said, ""Princess Kaguya, I am Lord Spring.""  and second man said, ""i am Lord Winter.""  and  third man said, ""i am Lord Spring... Summer.""  and fourth one said, ""i am Lord Autumn.""  and then, behind four, gentlemen warrior, there are seven beautiful servant, girls are there.
And then next, girls said, ""Princess Kaguya, your highness, I am, uh, uh, I am, uh, Lady Monday.""  and second one said, ""i am Lady Tuesday... Lady Wednesday.
Lady Thursday.
Lady Friday.
Lady Saturday.
Lady Sunday.
I’m your servant, your highness.
Your wish is my command.""  and they bowed very gently toward Princess Kaguya.
And the man and woman were so surprised because, they treated Kaguya so, so wonderful.
And they called Kaguya,""your highness, Princess, Kaguya.""  and then, uh, the man called Lord Winter, told the man and woman."" Princess Kaguya is my_ our king’s daughter, ruling moon.
And we came here to, uh, bring her back to moon.
Because she’s now seventeen-years-old.
And then beautiful music, and beautiful smell, just filled with air.
And, uh, Kaguya said to her mom and dad, ""thank you very much, m- father and mother, now I have to go back to, my country.
So that I cannot marry, marry to your Lord.
And thank you very much.
I love you forever.
When you miss me, you look at moon, then, i’m going to smile at you.""  then... Princess Kaguya... Well, uh, uh, sh- boarded in a ship and they_ ship gradually going up to the moon.
And everybody said, ""good bye, Princess Kaguya.""  the man and woman cried, cried, cried because they missed Kaguya so much.
So that every day they looked at moon, and talking about Kaguya, ""how are you.
I miss you so much.
I love you so much.""  then each time they say moon smiles."
"I lived in Florida, for many years and while we were there we liked to dive into the water and get sand dollars.
They are little round, uh, three inch diameter little animals that are flat, and lay on the bottom on the ocean.
When we, retrieve them, we like to dry them out, and bleach them.
They become white.
And then, uh, they have a hole near one end of the, of the animal.
And in that hole we put a clip and therefore we process them that way to make jewelry with them.
And once they have been bleached, we, color them with food coloring.
And then we must put them into polyurethane in order to harden them because they are very fragile.
And after they have been in through all this process, they're ready to be strung on beads.
And we did it for fun.
However all the tourists that saw us wearing them liked them so well, that they ordered various numbers from us to take home, to their cities and, uh, therefore we started a mail order business this way."
"Okay, here's my family.
I live in a big house, in this suburb, um, near a city called Philadelphia.
I have two parents.
My father is fifty.
And soon he'll be fifty-one.
Um, and he works ... He's a manager, and he works with a computer company.
Um... My mother, uh... Is ... She works in a Jewish synagogue.
She's what's called a cantor.
Um, and she, uh, helps lead the services by singing.
Um... And then I'm the, the older child.
I'm nineteen.
And my younger sister is sixteen years old.
And she goes to high school.
And she plays flute.
And she plans to be, a professional flutist in an orchestra.
And I have, two grandparents, my father's parents.
Um, and they live in Florida, uh, which is nice and warm and it has a beach.
Uh, and we can ... Every year we go to Florida to visit my grandparents, and go to the beach."
"Okay here are... Some things that i... Some things that I like.
I like to try new things and learn new things.
And some of my favorite ways of doing that,are to, uh, taste new foods and, um, read books and hear ideas that I've never heard before.
And I also, uh like learning about new ideas by talking to new people.
I, I really like talking to strangers.
And, I can also learn a lot by traveling.
Um... And I guess listening to new music, especially when someone I know plays for me, their favorite music.
And we can talk about it together.
Okay here's some things that I don't like.
I don't like it when people are mean, and inconsiderate of other people and they just do, nasty things that they don't need to do.
I don't like it when people waste things, and, throw away things they didn't_ they could've just reuse them or find some other way.
Um... I don't like it when I see a dead animal by the side of the road.
And... I don't like pistachio ice cream."
"My name is Scott Christian Anderson.
My first name Scott was given to me by my parents.
And I think that I was named after Scotland which is my mother's home country.
My middle name Christian, I think is a name after the religion of my parents which is Christianity.
And my last name Anderson is, from my father's ancestors, who were all named Anderson.
And the reason they were named Anderson, is because, in Sweden, um, if someone's name was Anders and he had a son, the last name of that son would be Anderson or Anderson [with different pronunciation].
And so, my name is Scott Christian Anderson."
" my name is Selma.
I'm seventy years old and retired.
I have a part-time job for a car leasing company.
I work two days a week, and I really love the job.
It mainly consists of answering the phone, doing some typing, paying some bills, and now I'm learning to work the computer.
The computer is a wonderful thing, and I'm finding it very very interesting to do.
The car leasing business is an unusually new business.
You can lease a car for two or three years and at the end of that time you can either buy it, or you can trade it in for a new car.
Many people seem to like this idea, and it has really caught on.
I'm also a homemaker.
I have a husband, I have two married daughters and two grandchildren.
The grandchildren's ages are fourteen and twenty-four.
We live in a retirement community.
The retirement community has tennis courts, swimming pools, a golf course, and a club house.
The club house consists of a building with a number of rooms where we take classes and courses.
Our community is near a large college town, which is really a wonderful thing to have nearby.
It has an art museum, and we are also able to avail ourselves of the classes given at the university. "
"Hi, I'm from India.
And I would like to talk about my family.
Unlike the olden days when we had, uh, joint families in India, nowadays we just have nuclear families in the cities.
And so is my family.
It's very small.
It's just my, father, my brother and my, uh, mother.
Um, and my father is a chemistry professor.
He is, uh, up to his retirement soon.
So he'll be looking for alternate jobs, to keep himself occupied.
My mother is a biology teacher.
I think, th- they both, uh, because their interest in science, they got, got al- me also interested into science.
And that's why I'm pushing.
Uh, a P-H-D in electrical engineering.
And my, younger brother is really young, he's just, going to his high school.
And he, he says that his aim in the future is to become a, cricket player.
He wants to be in the Indian cricket team.
So he practices real hard for it.
But I really don't know, what chance he has in the competitive, cricket world today.
So when I go back to India, maybe I'll check him out, find out how good he really is.
Uh, I'm looking forward to visiting my family."
"I have an orange corn snake.
And his name's Simon.
He is about four feet long.
And... About every week he has to eat.
I don't want to feed him, a live squeaky mouse.
So we have trained him to eat, dead mice.
So we defrost a mouse... And then I dangle it in front of him.
And then he bites it, and squeezes it, and swallows it whole.
And the whole process takes about five minutes."
"When I was young, in high school, I learned to play the piano.
I had a very good teacher, and, um, we also, sang in choruses.
Um, there were a couple of friends and I who, um, sang together.
And so I got the idea that it would be fun to... Teach my two sisters how to sing.
And, uh, we would sing a la Andrews Sisters style.
And entertain the, uh, soldiers, during world war two.
And we did.
We sang with the band.
And, um, traveled here and there.
We'd sing for the Lions Club or Elks Club or this, that and the other.
Sometimes we were on stage.
But, um, we didn't really want to go into it as a profession.
Because, um, it just wasn't us.
Haha.
So after, college, um, we went our separate ways.
We all got married and had, uh, children and lived happily ever after."
"Let me tell you a little bit about my schedule while i studied in college.
I would usually get up pretty late, probably about eight o'clock.
The first thing i would do is, quickly pray, then i would go to the bathroom, wash my face and, try to finish waking up.
After that i would go to the kitchen and eat breakfast.
I'd usually eat something small, like a bagel, maybe, a little sandwich or toast, sometimes cereal.
After that i would go back to the bedroom and get dressed.
I usually wore jeans and a T-shirt, and tennis shoes.
After that, i would go back to the bathroom, brush my teeth, comb my hair, sometimes i would put on make-up, but usually not.
Then i would, put all my books in my backpack and head out the door and go to class.
I usually had class from, about, nine until twelve.
Then after that i would eat lunch.
Usually i would come back to my room and eat or sometimes i would go to the cafeteria.
After that i usually had a lab.
I studied chemistry.
So i would go to chemistry lab for three hours every afternoon.
When my chemistry lab finished at about four-thirty, then i went to the gym to exercise.
I exercised for about, two hours.
After that i would go back to my room, take a shower, get cleaned up and head to the cafeteria to eat dinner.
After dinner, i would return to my room, study for a couple of hours, probably from three to whatever, depending on how much work i had.
Then i would brush my teeth, get into my pajamas and get ready for bed again. "

"I would like to say a few words about... Tamil Nadu.
This, um, southern most state in India.
This is the place i was, born and raised.
Um, for people who visit Tamil Nadu... Surely one of the interesting aspects is_ are the temples which are found in every, street corner.
They should, uh, surely visit, uh, Minakushi Temple in Madurai, which is probably the mo- the biggest of all the temples.
And, there are, several other temples spread all over the, state where they can go and see the unique architectural aspects.
The... Um, other aspect of Tamil Nadu is that it has its own language.
The Tamilians are very proud of their language.
The language has_ the s- grammatical structure was established two thousand years ago.
And it has been, preserved without much changes for, all these years.
And the literature itself is very interesting.
Those who are familiar with the language of course will know that.
Those who, cannot read Tamil should surely read the English translations to know about the stories and, the, how the... Old culture of Tamil Nadu was.
The other interesting aspect of Tamil Nadu is its, cuisine.
The, cooking style is very unique.
Should, uh, also... Check that out when you visit Tamil Nadu.
Um, so Tamil Nadu is a very interesting place to visit. "
"Hello, my name is Stephanie.
I teach English as a second language.
In the United States we call that E-S-L.
I've been teaching E-S-L for four years.
I started when I started college.
I used to teach on Thursdays and Fridays for, an hour and half every night.
Most of my students are from Guatemala, and Mexico.
Although i've also had students from Czechoslovakia and Poland.
I really enjoy teaching English because it lets me meet people from other countries, and it's very nice to see, how the students progress.
I really like it when, I spend a lot of time trying to teach someone something, and they finally learn it.
It's very exciting."
"I am an elderly handicapped widow, in retirement... But i have lots of memories.
One of my... Most wonderful memory is of training girl scouts ages_ well fourth, fifth, and sixth graders.
I like to teach them because, they're so eager to learn anything, uh, everything.
I've taught them cooking and sewing.
And, um, we would go hiking.
We would take trips, bicycle trips, um, picnics, parties of all kinds.
Um, touring, um, local... Places such as the sewer farm, haha, which they did not want to repeat haha and, and then after all those experiences for several years i, taught the same thing with, um, ah, a church group.
The same age, fourth, fifth, and sixth graders.
Because, they're so eager to learn and they haven't yet formed all those definite opinions and be against anything."
"When we were in... Greece my greatest pleasure was to ride through the city.
And be shown where the original, Olympia stadium was.
It was the, it was the one built for the_ when they revie- renewed the Olympics.
Uh, it was quite large.
But being in the heart of the city could not really, take care of all the people, coming there.
So they had to build another one further out for the very next Olympics.
Uh, we saw, we saw the stadium and where the very first torch was lit.
We were so intrigued with that, we decided to go visit the island where they had Olympia.
And there is where the very first, Olympic ... Uh, the men first practiced.
And they_ i- it ha- we had the, uh, all of their_ the entire stadium was laid out in a practice field.
And each section of it was, set aside for a different kind of... Of performance.
And mostly it was, uh, the strength of the men that they were working for_ um, working on.
But most of the time, they were all in ruins because the... Columns were made of granite, and they had already crumbled.
So we saw only what was left of these columns.
However the_ where we walked were cobble stones.
And they were_ we were informed they were the original, cobble stones.
And there we pictured, where the men were practicing.
And of course we couldn't figure out, what they would use for weight lifting unless it was the stones that we saw.
The each_ these huge stones.
But it was enjoyable because, we were so close to history and where the very first Olympics were being practiced and it was very nice."
"Here's a story from Africa, collected by the famous folklorist, Hugh Tracy.
He calls it, 'The Cat Who Came Indoors'.
Once upon a time, there was a cat.
A wild cat, who lived alone by herself.
But after a while she got tired of being alone, and she looked around for a husband, and she found a wild cat.
Who she thought was the finest creature in all the jungle.
And so they lived, happily together.
Until, one day, strolling through the grass, suddenly [whooshing sound] up from the grass leapt a leopard.
Right on top of Wildcat.
And there was a ball rolling over.
Of fur, and claws in the dust.
And, wild cat, was no more.
'Hmmm,' thought our Wildcat.
'I see wild cat is not the finest creature in the jungle.
It is leopard.
' And she went to live with leopard.
And they lived very happily together.
Until one day, when they were stalking through the bush, [lion's roar] up from the bush jumped lion, right on top of leopard's back, and ate him all up.
And that was that.
'Hmmm,' thought Wildcat.
'I see that leopard is not the finest creature in the jungle.
It is lion.
' And she went to live with lion.
And they lived happily together.
One day, when they were stalking, through the grass, across the savannah, suddenly a giant shape loomed up in front of them, and [whooshing sound] elephant's foot stepped right on top of lion, and squashed him flat.
And that was that.
'Hmmm,' though Wildcat.
'I see that lion is not the finest creature in the jungle.
It is elephant.
' And Wildcat leapt on top of elephant, and sat down between his ears, purring, happily.
And so they lived happily together.
Until, one day, as lion was moving... Until one day, as elephant was moving through the long bushes, by the river, suddenly, [gunshot noise] bang, a loud shot, and elephant sank to the ground.
Wildcat looked around.
And she saw a small man, with a gun.
'Hmmm,' she thought, 'elephant is not the finest creature in the jungle.
It is man.
' And she walked along behind man, following him to his village, and when she got there, she leapt on top of the thatch, and sat there, in the warm sun, purring contentedly.
And of course, in the village, she collected and caught, all the mice, and all the, rats.
And she lived very happily.
Until one day, she heard the sound of two voices below her, in the hut.
There was man shouting, and there was woman, his wife shouting.
And the shouts grew louder, and louder, until suddenly, man was thrown out of the hut.
And bowled over in the dust.
'Hmmm...' Thought Cat, 'man is not the finest creature in the jungle.
Now i do know who the finest creature is, it is woman.
' And he climbed down from the thatch, and he went inside the hut, and he sat beside the fire.
And he's been there ever since."
"Well, so you ask me about what food I eat during the day.
It's not very exciting, I have to say.
Uh, but, I eat, a break- I start out with a breakfast, that I think is fairly typical of many Americans.
I, I tend to have a bowl of cereal, with milk... That tends to be the basis, of my breakfast.
And then, with it, along with it, I will often have a piece of fruit.
Like an apple, or an orange, or a banana.
Later in the day, for lunch, I will often have a sandwich, sometimes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Or... I might cook up some pasta, uh, some pasta and, uh, spaghetti sauce... Or some macaroni and cheese.
I'm a student so I can't afford very expensive lunches.
Um... And maybe i'll have a little side salad, to go with it.
Um, now before dinner i_ it's hard for me to go for the whole afternoon without eating something else.
So i'll often have something sweet, like a pastry or some coffee or both, uh, to keep me going until dinner time.
And my dinner is, very_ sometimes very similar to my lunch.
Although sometimes, uh, often more substantial.
Uh, we Americans tend to make our dinner the big meal of the day.
And, uh, I'm no exception.
But, uh, I do tend to have things that are similar to lunch, pasta, sandwiches.
Things that are inexpensive because, uh, because of my budget.
But I will also keep, snack foods in the house, like chocolate, like popcorn, uh, pretzels, things that I can_ that I would_ that I would never make part of a meal, but that are, uh, that keep me going throughout the day, uh, and that I enjoy eating."
"Once upon a time... There was a very very nice grandpa lived in, uh, uh, village.
He was so kind, and, uh, he was so gentle.
And everybody loved him.
He was always nice to animals.
And he loved, uh, his dog very much.
He had a neighbor about his age.
But he was not kind.
He was not generous.
He was mean, and, uh, stingy very, very abusive old man.
One day, little tiny, uh, dog.
Alley dog wondered around and he, come to, uh, mean grandpa’s house.
He was so hungry and, uh, he wanted to eat.
But mean grandpa... Chased him, and, uh, hit him and, uh, said, ""get lost, dirty animal.
Don’t ever ever come back.""  so, poor hungry dog, hehe, went to the next house.
And barked to kind grandma, uh, uh grandpa.
And grandpa saw a little dog barking."" oh little dog, what happened.
You must be_ you look so hungry.
Okay i give you warm food for you.
I, i have a piece of chicken left.
So you can enjoy it.""  and grandpa, kind grandpa now brought a slice of chicken and then bread and, uh, gave, gave them all to the little starved dog.
Dog ate, ate, ate, and felt_ until he couldn’t eat anymore.
Then... Grandpa said ""okay, if you don’t, you don’t have anywhere to go you can stay here.
You can live with me.""  so, little, little poor dog started to living with, uh, kind grandpa.
One day... Grandpa was in, still in bed, then that little dog started barking at the back yard, ""wu wu wu wu wu wu"" and grandpa was still sleepy.
But, uh, dog kept barking.
So noisy.
And so finally he got up from his bed and said, ""what happened with you.
Why you are barking so much.
.&Quot; and, little dog kept barking, barking.
So grandpa went there, and dog was, uh, dog was, uh, digging with his, uh, little, you know, paws.
So grandpa brought a big shovel and, uh, dig out the hole.
Then guess what.
He found, er, uh, he found, uh, he found, uh, gold coins, old coins in a jar.
And, ""oh, what a wonderful dog you are.""  then, the neighbors mean grandpa watched the whole thing and... Said to him, ""oh my goodness.
Then we have to have that dog.""  and, uh, then he stole that little dog from, kind grand_ grandpa’s house.
And he waited.
That little dog start teaching him... By barking, barking and uh, where, you know, gold may be.
But dog didn’t bark.
And dog didn’t bring anything to him.
So he got finally so mad at him and, uh, an, uh, killed him.
And little dog... Well_ uh, and threw him out.
Then kind grandpa saw it and cried and, and, ""oh my little dog i’m sorry i i i’m sorry.""  and, uh, then he burned little dog’s, uh, body with, uh, with, uh, uh, very nice, you know, funeral he had.
And then... Grabbed the ash in his, uh, palm and said ""okay, now you’re going to go to the, uh, heaven.""  he spread the dog ash to, dead tree.
Then wind came.
And dog’s ash just spread on the tree.
And, those ash became very beautiful cherry flowers.
And grandpa’s, good grandpa’s, old, dead tree became beautiful cherry, cherry tree with lots of cherry blossoms on."
"A lot of ancient story, and a lot of, what we call primitive story.
Though perhaps that is the wrong word.
Tries to explain about creation.
Creation perhaps of the universe or the creation of, us as, human beings.
And, in Australian aboriginal culture they have lovely wonderful stories about, how all the different animals were created.
Now this is a story about, how the sand frog got his name.
And the sand frog, from the name, is a frog that spends all its day time, buried in the sand, and only comes out at night to take a drink.
This is how it came by its name.
There was once quite an ordinary frog, who spoke just like every other frog.
One day that frog became thirsty.
And he went to the pond.
And he started to drink.
And he drank, and he drank, and he drank.
And as he drank he got bigger, and bigger, and bigger.
And he drank until he had drained that pond dry.
And all the other animals, the kangaroos, and the emus, and the dingo dogs, they all said, 'hey frog, don’t be so greedy.
We need water too.
'But the frog just said [frog sound effect].
And went plopping on its way.
Until he came to a river where he drank, and he drank, and he drank.
And as he drank he became bigger and bigger, and bigger.
And all the little tadpoles, and all the dragonflies, and all the little river folk said, 'hey frog, don’t be so greedy.
We need water too.
'But the frog just said [frog sound effect].
And went plopping on his way.
Until he came to a great big lake.
And he was still thirsty.
So he drank, and he drank, and he drank.
And he got bigger, and bigger, and bigger.
And all the fishes flopping around on the dry bed of the lake were saying, 'hey frog, don’t be so greedy.
We need water too.
'And the frog just said [frog sound effect].
And went plopping on his way.
And you know he drank up every pond.
He drank up every river.
He drank up every lake in that land.
And got bigger, and bigger and bigger.
Until he just flopped down on top of a mountain, great big belly spreading all over it.
And there was no water left in the land.
And all the other animals, and the birds, and the fishes they gathered around... Saying, 'frog, give us back our water.
We are thirsty.
'And the frog just said [frog sound effect].
So what could the animals do.
Well here is what they did.
They sent the dingo dog, who has got sharp teeth to bite a hole in the frog’s big, swollen belly.
And that he did.
And out of that hole came pouring... All the water.
And it ran down the side of that mountain.
And it ran into the ponds.
And it ran into the rivers .
And it ran into the lakes.
Until all the water was back in the land.
And as the water flowed out of its belly that frog got, smaller, and smaller, and smaller.
Until he was just the size of a normal frog again.
And you know, he was so ashamed of himself, for having been so greedy.
That he couldn’t face all those other animals.
So he went to hide himself in the sand.
And that is where he lives to this day.
And only comes out at night time, to take a little drink from the pond.
[Frog sound effect].
And that is how the sand frog got his name."
"Where do you think stories go to after they've been told.
That is right; they go into your memory.
You might call it a memory, i call it story bag.
And it's very important that you sometimes take those stories out of your story bag.
And give them to someone else.
Because, there was once a boy.
A boy who was brought up by his grandfather.
And every night went the boy went to bed, the grandfather would sit beside him and tell him a story.
And he was a good story teller that grandfather.
So that when the boy went to school in the morning, all his friends would gather around and say, 'will you tell us the story that your grandfather told you last night.
'Now the boy would say, 'nope.
' He would never tell those stories.
Now what happened was that, every time that the grandfather told a story, hanging in the corner of the room there was an old leather bag that, had been there for ages and nobody really knew what it was for.
But every time grandfather told a story, that story, would go and slip into the bag.
Every night, another story would slip, into the story bag.
And because the boy never took those stories out to give them to anyone else, that bag began to get filled with stories.
Until those stories were treading on each other's toes, digging each other in the ribs.
Oh, that story bag became so crowded, that it became uncomfortable.
And it wasn’t long before some of the... More wicked of those stories began to, decide what they could do to get their own back on the boy, and teach him a lesson.
And there was one story in there about a snake.
Now not all stories are wicked, and not all snakes are wicked.
But this one was.
And it so happened that the grandfather, was passing by the bedroom door, when he heard all the stories grumbling and talking to each other in the bag.
And he listened.
And he heard what it was that the snake story was going to do.
So that night, after he had told the boy another story.
And blown out the candle.
And after that story had just managed to squeeze itself into the story bag.
Instead of going down the stairs, grandfather waited outside.
And when the boy was asleep grandfather heard the slithering... Sound... As the snake story slipped out of the bag.
And began to snake its way across the floor to bite the boy on the foot.
When suddenly.
Into the bedroom burst the grandfather.
Grabbed that snake by the neck.
Thrust it back into the story bag.
The boy woke up, 'grandpa, grandpa what is happening.
What is happening.
'And the grandfather sat down by the bed again, and lit the candle.
And he told the boy about the stories, and the way they got cross... Because they were never taken out of the bag.
So the next day... When the boy went to school he took the story bag with him.
And he began taking those stories out one at a time, and telling them to his friends.
So the stories flew free.
And they were happy.
And the boy was happy.
And his friends were happy.
So was his grandfather.
So, do remember, that when you are told a story, don’t just leave it in your story bag.
Take it out... And give it to someone else."
"Okay suppose, just for the sake of discussion or argument.
Suppose that there is no God.
One still has to do well.
I mean you don’t have to.
But it would be better, to try to, be nice.
As a matter of fact, mo- more than just being nice... One could become a saint without God.
Put it this way, if one does good, it's very nice and very simple and easy to do it, if one expects a vast reward like life after death.
Um, perpetual bliss, seeing the face of God and all the rest.
But, it would be better to do good without expecting any reward.
One fellow, who wrote about this_ was, Albert (Camus), who wrote many books.
One of which was called La Pest, The Plague.
It's an example of a saint without God.
A journalist visits a city where, plague has broken out.
He volunteers to help bury the dead.
But then he catches the plague and he dies.
So he’s an example of the saint without God.
Very interesting, concept, especially, these days.
Because there is so much terrorism and war going on that people don’t seem to catch on, to the fact that it gets much_ mu- more and more dangerous to have wars, and terrorists and so forth as time goes on.
I'd like to live long enough to see some of these... Things solved, put, put to rest.
I don’t know, we'll see.
I was very ill years ago with_ of cancer, and so, as a result every day is a fresh wonderful gift, the Jews say that, ""one is allowed to live longer so that one can give at least one good, deed a day.""  and so let me work with that hypothesis."
" i'm Japanese, and so far i've lived in three countries, uh, Japan, of course, because i'm Japanese, and in England and in the U-S.
Uh, in those three places, i lived... In... In a house.
And Japanese houses_ house_ houses um, houses in those three countries are very different.
And one of the things i noticed which i, which i found very interesting was where they put the toilet.
Um... If we think... If we think of typical two-story house... There's a_ in Japan, in Japanese house, there's a toilet downstairs.
But in England, they have a toilet upstairs.
And in America, in the United States, they have one on each floor.
I i suppose there are good points and conve- good points and bad points having toilets upstairs or downstairs.
For example, um... If you have a toilet downstairs, if... A stranger v_ a stranger knocks on your door and ask... Asks to use your toilet, then... It will be easier because you don't need to take him upstairs.
But if you are sleeping, which normally, which nor- people normally do upstairs... And if you feel like go to the toilet middle of the night, then it's easier if you don't need to come downstairs to go to the toilet... So i don't know which is good.
Uh... But it seems that, you know, having toilet... Having toilet on each floor seems to be the best.
So in terms of... Toilets, i suppose American houses are very convenient. "
"A question comes, why do i like music so much.
Well several reasons.
One of it is_ one reason is that, um, music keeps me young.
That is it makes me feel young.
Another reason, is that, music... Gives me a good feeling about myself, as a human being, as a person.
So i feel fine that i've worked, written something, taught something, played something.
And... I mean my talent is nowhere near, that of Steven Mackey.
And especially of someone like Mozart, you know, he could hear a symphony once and then he could write it down from memory.
Fantastic talents exist.
But doesn't matter, one looks... At this in a non-competitive way."
"My name is Kay.
I moved to Princeton New Jersey from California... In nineteen-ninety-five because I wanted to, be near by daughter, who lives nearby.
And i, enjoy living here.
It's quite a change from California.
But, um, I've grown used to it.
Mainly because I was born and raised in Mississippi and they had the same kind of climate, down there.
I spent fifty years in California, doing everything.
We had a wonderful life there.
I, uh, uh, had two years of college in Memphis, Tennessee, and two at the University of Southern California.
And my college major was piano.
So naturally I was involved in music in all kinds of ways.
Choruses_ and two sisters and I sang with bands.
And, um, I was able to teach music here and there and perform.
When I moved to, um, the San Juoquin Valley.
Um, in nineteen-forty-eight I got busy raising a family and, um, helping my husband.
And, um, we've had a great life.
He, um, finally got to be a pretty wealthy guy.
And, um, he put in shopping centers and developments and so forth.
But then cancer got him and, um, it was um hard to live in California after that because I wasn't near my family.
I was just... There in this town.
So I moved here to be near my daughter."
"I am a pianist.
I guess I should say was because I'm a little out of practice now.
I haven't played for a few years.
But, huh, I went into it because, um, it just spoke to me I guess ha.
I um_ when you live out in the country, and you have problems, music just makes them all go away.
And knowing that you can master, an instrument, this makes you feel great.
Like, um, a horseman mastering his horse haha.
You know, it's just, uh, you just feel good about it.
And you know that you're giving pleasure to others.
And that makes you feel better.
I, um, always felt I was born knowing music.
Uh, it was easy for me.
I made straight A's in it in college.
And... I could see it.
It was easy.
Where others would be struggling they just couldn't figure it out.
And I just couldn't understand why they couldn't see.
Haha.
But, um, it's been wonderful."
"I am a captain, of an American flag football team in my scho- at my college.
It's an intramural team.
And it consists of fourteen to fifteen players.
While seven people play, on the field at once.
The object of the game well, it's like American football.
If you're not familiar with that you there's a, there's a football.
I wouldn't know how to describe a football.
Um, and you have to score, points by carrying the football or throwing the football past the end line which is the goal line.
In flag football there's no contact.
Where ... As in American football there is heavy contact.
Um, but in flag football people wear belts, with flags taped onto the belt.
And the object is to remove the flag, from the belt before they get over the goal line.
And if you do that you stop them, and they don't score.
Um, person with more points wins.
A very fun sport.
Um, oh yeah, i'm the captain of it.
I play, I play, um, position of wide receiver.
Who the, the position of wide receiver calls for you to, catch passes and, run real fast."
"One of my favorite books is <em>On the Road</em>, by Jack Kerouac.
And, it's about_ uh ,it takes place in the forties.
And it's about the, the whole beatnik, um, culture underground bohemian life style.
And, it's, it's one of those books just really makes you want to get up and go and just do what Sal Paradise did and_ where he just got in the car and went, and he_  uh, there's a lot of hitchhiking involved and a lot of times no direction and it was just fun.
And it was just go go go drop everything, and leave.
And it's something that, that it's a lot harder to do in our society now, I know.
Hitchhiking you could get like killed if you picked up a hitchhikers sometimes.
But it wa- it was that, that same free spirit that can still be found if you try hard enough.
And, i just_ i loved it, it such an inspiring book and it makes you just want to get up and go across country and explore, uh, the United States because there's so much to do here and there's so many people to meet.
And that's one thing i really liked about book is, is there were so many people that, that he and his friends came in contact with that... Were so unlike them.
And so, different from the communities that they grew up in.
And that's something that i, i always want to do.
And now after reading the book, i know that i have to, do at least one cross country trip before i die."
" I want to talk about Vietnamese cuisine.
And, to many of you, it may sound just like Chinese cuisine or Indian cuisine, it doesn't matter.
But in that part of the world where I come from, Vietnam, China, Korea, um each country has a very distinctive, uh, style of cooking and making food.
And, it's very special for me that people appreciate Vietnamese food.
Um, Vietnamese food is, um, very nutritious, but um much less spicy than, um,  Thai food, if you've eaten it, if you've tried it.
And um, we use a lot of ingredients that are only in Vietnam.
But, uh, I have become quite popular in, for example, America.
Uh, where there is a very large population, um, who came from Vietnam.
So, um, in Vietnam, the daily cooking is not much different from, um, say, eating out.
You eat almost the same type of food, back home and in restaurants.
There's nothing too_ different from what you get in a restaurant, um, which maybe in other countries may be considered more special than the, home made food.
Uh, one of the_ one of the most famous Vietnamese dish is uh the spring rolls.
And in Vietnamese, it's called <i>nam</i>.
And since it's very popular around new year and, you know, for a feast, a new year party and stuff like that.
So um it's called spring rolls.
And Vietnamese spring rolls are very different, from those, um, made by chin- almost- like, um, American Chinese.
And um... It's made with very thin rice paper, instead of the thick one that you, see that Chinese spring rolls are wrapped in.
And um... Another, um, very special type of Vietnamese food is, fish sauce.
And fish sauce tastes very good.
But... Smell a little bit.
And um, not too many foreigners like fish sauce, at first.
But once they've tried it, they kind of love it.
Um in Vietnam, fish sauce is used almost in every meal.
And um... We can fry vegetable... We can fry vegetable with fish sauce.
We can, make it into uh, sauces for dipping other food in.
It's very tasty.
And here in America, fish sauce doesn't taste like it tastes... Back home for me.
So I really want a chance to have a good Vietnamese meal with real good, fish sauce.
Um, the food in Vietnam is, um, to me_ it's much tastier than the food in America.
Um,  in Vietnam um... We eat a lot more healthy food.
And it's not like in America, and people eat the steak without any sauce on it, which to me is very tasteless.
And um, I'm going to have to live on sc- campus for two years.
I'm going have to eat American food for two years, and I'm not very happy about it.
Something interesting. "
"Yeah, uh, the course i am undertaking right now is, uh, quite exciting.
Uh, it is, a master’s degree in developmental practices.
And basically it has got to do with, uh, complex emergencies and humanitarian assistance.
And, um, i find it very interesting because i have been working, for, a relief and development agency, three years before i came to join the course.
And, uh... I am getting to know the theories behind a lot of the, practices that we, implemented whilst we are in the field.
And, um, you know, i, i find my course very useful for me since, uh, my, my country is at war at the moment, and, uh, i think they need people like me to go back and assist with, uh, not only relief, but also with rehabilitation and reconstruction, when the dust would have settled down."
"I won't need to really tell you my, nationality, because after two point five seconds, i’m sure you’ve guessed, i’m French.
Now the French language is quite interesting language, because it is absolutely flat.
As a result, it is very difficult for French people to learn another language.
Because, other language have tonic accents.
But that’s not the only difficulties you have when you, are a French speaker and you, try to learn, in particular English.
There is the difficulties of, the sounds that you’ve never learned.
And you have to learn like 't-h'.
Which most French people tend to pronounce 'suh' or 'zuh' depending of the case.
Hehe, a brilliant example of, uh, what i was saying.
And, um, also sounds which we do not have in French.
And we_ that we can’t hear.
Um, and i’m referring here to 'h’s'.
Um, now French people have this, awful tendency to drop 'h’s'.
When I arrived_ well the first year i was in Great Britain, my French accent was a bit like this.
Which is really bad.
Um, i had the, the chance to, to make the acquaintance of few linguists.
Who recorded uh, m- my voice to study my accent.
Because they thought it was really, uh, interesting.
They always reassured me.
Telling me it’s really cute, the French accent.
Yeah it’s really nice.
Um, but i find it really frustrating.
Uh, so i asked them whether they had methods to... Teach me to speak properly English, or with a less of a_ less of a French accent.
The hardest, and hear i pronounced my 'h', was 'h’s'.
Um, because i couldn’t hear 'h’s'.
Um, so after, after a few month i started, i started to actually recognise the sound.
Um, and i did what was called overcorrection, putting 'h’s' all over the place.
Um, and, um, it was, um, it was, it was, uh, sounding a bit like 'hello how h-are hyou.
' And, um, it was, uh, very funny for everyone around me.
'Cause i would put 'h’s' all over the place.
And this resulted in a quite embarrassing situation once.
Um, a friend of mine had, uh, loaned me some_ a pair of earrings.
And they were really beautiful earrings, that were given to, to her by a uncle who was an artist, etcetera, etcetera.
So she had, uh, leant them to me and i wore them and i broke one of them.
And i was very upset.
And my friend’s name is, Iranda.
And we had a common friend who’s name, um, was Elani.
And Elani was in my room and i was very upset about the whole story.
And i said to Elani, 'listen Elani, you know, i have something to tell you.
' And she said 'what it is.
' And i said 'well Iranda has a hearing problem.
' And Elani looked at me and said, 'oh.
I, i never noticed a, a_ it’s true.
Maybe, maybe it’s true.
Um, maybe sometimes she doesn’t understand when i speak and, or this.
' And i wasn’t understanding what Elani was speaking about.
I said 'no, no, no.
Not hearing problem, hearing problem.
' And i, i showed the earring.
And, um, at that moment Elani understood what i was speaking about and, burst into laughing.
At that point Iranda get into the room.
Um, and, uh, Elani was just laughing and couldn’t stop.
So Iranda asked, what the_ what is happening.
And Elani says, 'well you know Iranda you have a hearing problem.
' And, uh, Iranda was really confused.
She said, 'really.
Uh, i’ve never noticed.
Do i speak loud or whatever.
' And, um, uh, we finally after, after teasing her like this for five minutes, um, decided to tell her what the hearing problem in question was.
Um, and it_ this stayed, um, between my friends.
There is_ several other stories.
I mean there’s always a classical story of getting the wrong word, um, and for the wrong situation.
Um, and for instance, um, one day i wanted to_ some water and i said to a friend, 'yeah i would like some water.
Otherwise i’m going to get deheedrated.
' And the word was dehydrated.
But, um, and that always makes people laugh all around me.
Um, the most embarrassing is that most of the time, you think you, you’re correct.
And you don’t understand why people laugh.
Um, and it, can it can, um, can be really frustrating.
Um, but most of the time people laugh nicely.
They don’t laugh, laugh, um, in a mean way at you.
I mean they know that you are trying to do your best speaking a language which is_ which is not your mother tongue.
And i have to say that anyway even i don’t speak perfectly English.
I really, really enjoy speaking it.
Um, and i’m_ really enjoy listening to it.
And i really enjoy being in England.
And... Being with English persons and speaking this language."
"Recently i read a book.
This book was about Australian aborigine culture.
The man who wrote the book, has lived for several years with, Australian aborigines and he's also done a lot of research.
And he told one story in particular, which i found very interesting, both as an expression of, the culture which the aborigines had, and also in relation to my own personal life.
In my personal life i like to play soccer.
And i've played soccer, since i think, i was six years old on teaMs 
And even before then, i have pictures which i can find from when i was two and three years old, and i have a little ball at my feet.
So... Here was a story combining soccer and then this,very interesting culture of the Australian aborigines.
So the Australian aborigines didn't invent soccer.
And they only, were introduced to soccer when, Europeans came to Australia, in i think, the seventeen hundreds.
And when the ah Europeans came, they saw how the, aborigines lived and they wanted the aborigines to, live more like Europeans and do things the way Europeans, do things, like how Europeans grow food or build houses.
And so the Europeans also wanted the Australians to play soccer, because that's something which the Europeans liked very much and they felt it would be good if, the Australians also played soccer.
So for instance, when one of the missionaries from Europe, one of the, um, priests or ministers, i'm not sure which, came to Australia, he would take some boys and and he would teach them how to play soccer.
He would give them a ball, i suppose, and show them how to make a goal, maybe out of trees, or maybe, metal, or maybe just uh some rocks on the ground, i don't know.
And make two teams and, teach them how to kick the ball around, and pass it and, get into the goal, i suppose, that's how you teach someone how to play soccer.
However... In soccer, you usually have one team that scores more goals that the other.
Sometimes, they both score the same amount, but most of the time... Um, somebody usually scores more and somebody scores less.
And then you have a winner and a loser.
However when the aborigine boys began to play soccer, they learned all the rules except for this last one of having a winner and a loser.
They actually changed the rules, so that, every game would end with both teams having the same amount of goals.
There would never be a winner and a loser.
And they did this because in their culture, which is, many many years old, i think many hundreds of thousands of years old, that's an incredibly long time, they didn't have competition like this.
They didn't think that it was, beneficial or helpful to have games where there was a winner and a loser.
So when they played soccer, they had no winners and losers.
They played every game so that everybody had the same number of goals.
And to me this is very beautiful."
"When my children were young... We decided that since we lived, so close to the... Sierra Nevada mountains, that it would be fun to own property up there and take them up for in fact every summer we went up there and rented a cabin and by this beautiful lake and we'd spend weeks up there.
And so we thought it would be wonderful to finally own one of our own.
There was an insurance man in, San Francisco, a very wealthy guy, who ran an ad in the Wall Street Journal, saying he had all this property for sale, at Huntington Lake and, um, he was going to sell it by July 4th to, to anybody.
So my husband decided that was just what we were looking for.
We went up there and, looked over the property.
And it was perfection.
So we bought it immediately.
There was, a large manor house on top of the hill.
In stone_ made of stone.
And it had everything from a dishwasher to whatever.
It was a beautiful place.
Another one was like a motel.
It had several bedrooms, kitchen_ it had two kitchens, two living rooms, and so on.
And, uh, there was a little cottage by the_ right down by the shore.
That, um, was perfect for a couple.
And, uh, another little guest cottage that would sleep two people.
And it was just perfect and so we bought it.
And it had been kept up so beautifully, and, in fact, um, all of the original linens and furniture and everything came with it.
We didn't have to buy a thing for it.
So we, enjoyed that so much, and we would let all of our friends borrow it for their vacations.
And, we would have all kinds of parties up there.
And it was just wonderful.
We could sleep a whole lot of people.
And, uh, i remember once my daughter bought her whole class up there to, uh, uh, water-ski and swim and enjoy the lake and the cabin.
And we would hike back in the wilderness and, there were other lakes back there that were beautiful to visit.
And this is a place just outside Fresno California.
Oh about, uh, an hours drive."
"Well i_ my mother, had, uh, seven children.
My father was always busy to support us.
So, I hardly saw him, at home.
My mother was, uh, actually raised us, taught us many things.
And, uh, scolded us, disciplined us.
Well i_ as I get older, I realized being a, uh, daughter, a girl in a family... Does not mean much.
Because I have, er, a, older brother who is two years older than i, I am.
And he was... A princess, no, prince of the house.
I am, a servant of, uh, my brother.
That’s the way, sort of why, I started to, uh, interpret my mother’s discipline.
And, uh, I was_ of course, I was not happy.
And I started rebel against, her... With, uh, this, uh, discrepancies of, uh, treatment.
Me from my brother, prince.
And, uh, unfortunately, my brother, was, uh, was, uh... I’m sure he was not aware of that.
Because he enjoyed his, right to be the oldest, uh, son in a family.
And, uh, my parents wanted him to be a engineer.
And he should be excel_ he should be excel in mathematics, science.
But me, i’m just a, daughter.
I’m just a girl.
And, uh, they taught me how to make bouquet of flower, flower beautifully.
Or how to make, uhm, clothes and, uh, cook, those kind of boring things.
Unfortunately, I was very, very good in mathematics at school.
And, uh, I went to female schools of course.
In those days females should not, hehe study together with, uh, boys.
So I went to female schools.
And over there, well I was very lucky because, uh, teachers really appreciated my talent.
And, I felt, uh, i, I was always praised by my performance.
And even, you know, one math teacher even told me, ""oh you are a genius.
You are going to do something very, you know, uh, wonderful in the future, if you keep doing it"".
And that made me so happy.
And, uh, every test I got hundred.
No matter what.
Any hard problems, I don’t know why, but I managed to solve very nicely, and, uh, teachers were very impressed by that.
And i, did not understand why I could do it.
And it just came out, just intuitively in my head.
So I was very proud of myself.
But, my mother, each time I showed her my scores, hundred, ninety-nine, ninety-eight.
All difficult problems I solved beautifully.
And, uh, then she, she, she was not happy at all.
And I couldn’t understand why she was not happy at all.
I thought she should be happy to_ for me.
And, uh, then my mother and i, went to see my teacher, because my teacher wanted to see my mother.
And of course, you know, I was very proud of what my teacher told my mother about me.
And, I was very happy, and i’m very proud of myself.
Then on the way back, I saw my mother’s face.
She was crying.
And I asked her, ""why you’re crying.
Aren’t you happy.""  she said... &Quot;oh my goodness.
Nobody want to marry to you.
Hehe.
You have to live a very lonely single life.
That's made me cry"" hehehe. "
"Because, I have been a musician, all of my adult life.
I brought some of, my skills, in listening, to a concert given recently at Princeton University.
One of the, performers, was a guitarist and composer named Steven Mackey.
S-T-E-V-E-N-M-A-C-K-E-Y who, um, performed beautifully on the electric guitar.
With a large chamber ensemble, meaning, about ten or eleven musicians.
They are playing notes that he had written.
But the music was unpredictable_ was very, very new, and not to everyone's taste.
But i loved it.
He played electric guitar throughout the whole performance on_ as, as improvisation.
And it was, wonderful.
I think if anyone asked me who is the best, or one of the better modern composers i would say, ""Steven Mackey."" I loved what he did.
He also had a tape.
And the tape played at points, throughout that performance, the sound of dogs barking.
Oh boy.
And i loved that, because i remember, having read about the German poet Goethe.
In Goethe's old age he couldn't sound the sound of dogs barking.
And here this fellow was, using the barking of dogs as part of the music.
When the, performance was over, there was dutiful applause.
People didn't know what to think.
I was pleased.
I've been teaching since i was about twenty-five.
Um, without a degree.
It didn't matter.
I worked for many years, over twenty, at a school called Horace Mann School, in Riverdale on the very West Bronx, New York.
I taught guitar there, mostly, one to one.
A student and a teacher.
And... At this point i had a few students.
Enough to give me the, um, the will to write arrangements for them.
And, they're adults.
They practice without being told.
I have had, had of course, at Horace Mann_ i had to teach little boys for a long time.
It was hard because they never practiced.
They were duti- very ,very polite children.
But they would say, ""Mr Morris i didn't practise guitar last week because we_ my family and i went to Tahiti."" some place like that you know.
And you couldn't nail them down.
So it_ that was difficult.
However those days are over.
Thankfully.
So i have a piano.
It is very expensive to have it tuned.
It costs seventy-four dollars and twenty cents, to have it tuned a few weeks ago.
But it is worth the investment, because when i play it, i get a good response.
I have a couple of guitars.
One of which is, fixed with a German microphone for electric playing.
But it doesn't have quite the bite of a real electric guitar, which is shaped differently.
Strings are closer together, they are all steel.
And one usually plays it with a pick.
And... Because, of the thin walls and my concern about neighbors, i almost never play the electric guitar.
So, i play these classical guitars, which are much quieter.
When i play piano for some time i hea- i hear, knocks on the wall.
Which i have learn to ignore, and not become annoyed.
Because i am annoying them as i play a song, on the piano."
"Well I'm very, lucky with my family, I think.
First for, for, for a reason that is quite superficial I think.
But, um, I have some family in Germany.
Some family in France, and in Britain.
Uh, of course in Switzerland.
So I can travel, and go and visit them.
And at the same time learn some languages.
Um, well, um, the family, uh, in which I live now, is quite big.
Uh, well I have both father and mother.
Uh, not, not granted of course.
And, they still live together.
I have, one older sister, she's called Charlene.
She is twenty-years-old.
One younger sister, Lucy, she's soon sixteen.
And one younger brother,  who's David_ is now nine already.
And, uh, just last year I discovered that I had a half-sister.
Um, she is living in Bologna, in Italy.
And she is now thirty-one.
Uh, she is half I- Italian.
Uh, actually, and it's quite surprising you, you, you don't know what to feel.
And actually, I have just met her once.
And now, now that I have been in England I couldn't meet her.
But, uh, my, my other sisters know her better than me.
But, I don't mind really I'll just take my time to, get to know her.
And, yeah, it, it makes it quite complicated.
I don't know how.
Um, just because... You don't_ well it's a bit, we are all a bit, um, overwhelmed.
A little bit tense sometimes.
That's why, maybe, I needed to go away from home.
I needed, yeah, just take some dis- distance.
And, I had to take a breath before, uh, before seeing_ uh, sorting it all out."
"I belong to a group called Amnesty International.
They're a human rights organization.
We recently had a case, of a young man named Nowan Shapel.
He's, was born and raised in India, but he is of Tibetan origin.
He came to the United States on a Fulbright Scholarship.
He was studying at Middlebury College in Vermont.
And for his, uh, thesis or for his, his work he went back to Tibet, to document traditional music, dancing and singing.
So he was there with his video camera taping... Llama's chanting and so on.
He was arrested by the Chinese.
They accused of spying and they sentenced him to eighteen years in prison.
So he's served about three years of that sentence so far.
And my group, is working to try to get him released.
There's also been some, uh, some people in the American government are trying to, to help him out too.
But so far without success.
So far the only thing we can do is collect signatures on petitions and, send them to, uh, the White House.
But, i don't know if that will be effective or not."
"Not long ago, I was in London, with a choir trip.
And I had a really fun experience.
I contacted a running group there, and, they met at a, subway stop, a metro stop.
And, it turned out the run, was set as sort of tour of the famous landmarks of London.
So we ended up running back and forth across the Thames several times.
And we saw, Buckingham Palace.
And we ran past, Downing Street, Houses of Parliament, lots of famous buildings.
They stopped one point, at Trafalgar Square for a rest, and they sang some sort of, funny songs.
And then kept running and eventually we, stopped back, and they stopped at a restaurant. "
"There was once a fiddler.
A very good fiddler.
So good he was, that he was called for many weddings and ev_ even funerals.
And he longed to have son, that he could teach all his skills too.
And when his wife became pregnant.
Oh, he was so pleased.
This was going to his, his boy, his son.
All that he was going to do.
He couldn't stop talking all through the nine months.
His wife did suggest if might be a girl.
But this was dismissed.
It was going to be a boy.
Well, eventually, the time came, that the child was born.
Put in the long robes, that was usual at that time.
And oh the... The fiddler he was so pleased about it all.
But, you see, there was one snag.
It was common in those days, that almost as soon as a child was born, it was christened.
But s_ the next time the minister was going to be around to do the christening, why, the fiddler had a wedding on the Saturday.
And he didn't really think he was going to be in a fit state, to take part in a christening on the following day.
And so he said to his wife, 'look, e- now we've got an extra mouth to feed, i mean it's really going to be important, that we get the money in.
Would you mind terribly if we put it off 'til the next time the minister was coming round.
' And rather to his surprise, she said it would be perfectly all right.
And so, on the Saturday, he went off to the wedding.
And it was the small hours of a Sunday when he came back.
So, he wasn't best pleased, when fairly early in the morning, there was a knock at the door.
And his wife answered it.
And there was, a well-dressed man.
Top hat, well-dressed.
Who, said could he come in.
He had something to discuss with them.
And so, she invited him in, and pulled h- her husband from his bed.
And, the man took off his hat.
And there in amongst his curls, they could see, two little horns.
This was the devil.
'Right,' said the devil.
'I've come for your child.
Your baby.
' ' E- wh- what do you mean.
' 'Well, you see, i've always longed for a son.
And yours is the only unchristened child in the parish.
So i've come for your baby son.
' 'Y- you can't do that,' said the fiddler.
'You can't do that,' said his wife.
'Oh, yes i can said the devil.
' And he made for the cradle.
But the fiddler said, 'hey, hang on a minute.
I believe you like wagers, and such, don't you.
' 'Yes,' said the devil.
'Well, couldn't you try us out with something.
' 'All right,' said the devil.
'I'll come back this evening, and i'll, ask you some questions.
If you can answer them, you can keep your son.
If not, he's coming with me.
' And suddenly, the devil wasn't there any more.
Well, the fiddler and his wife, they spent all that morning, and all that afternoon thinking of all the jokes, and riddles they could possibly think of.
So they'd be prepared, when the devil came back.
And then the devil came back, 'right,' said the devil.
'Are you ready.
' 'N... Yes,' they said.
And he turned to the fiddler.
'What has long blonde hair, but is loved by both men and women.
' And, the fiddler thought.
And, well his wife thought as well, but the devil was just talking to the fiddler, not the woman.
A- and, well, the fiddler couldn't think.
And the devil laughed, a horrible sort of chuckle.
And said, 'call yourself a fiddler, do you.
' 'Well, yes.
' 'Ahh, roared the devil.
And you can't get that when it's a fiddle bow.
' Oh, of course it was.
'Oh, well give me another chance.
' Said the fiddler.
The devil was enjoying himself.
'All right.
What's my favourite tune.
' Well, the dev_ the fiddler knew many devil tunes.
But, you know, how you're asked to produce something, and everything you know goes out of your mind.
The only thing he could think of, was the devil's curse.
And it wasn't likely to be that.
Or the devil amongst the tailors.
So, eventually, he stammered out, 'the devil amongst the tailors.
' And the devil laughed.
'Look, haven't i told you that i've waited all my life for a baby son.
It's a devil's dream of course.
' And he went to the cradle, and he grabbed the child.
And he was just going out of the door.
And the wife said, 'hey, hang on a minute.
I am as much that child's parent, as the fiddler there.
Haven't i got a chance to have a_ get my son.
' 'Hmm,' said the devil.
'I don't really hold with women.
All right.
What do i think which is wrong.
'And the fiddlers wife laughed.
She said, 'you think, if you take that child, you're going to get a son.
But let me tell you, you're in for a nasty shock.
It's a girl.
' And the devil vanished.
And the fiddler listened, sitting there open-mouthed.
'That's why i agreed to postpone the christening.
I didn't know how to tell you.
You've been on, and on, about having a son.
' But, well you can imagine, they went looking for the minister, there and then.
And had that child christened.
And do you know, she learned to play the fiddle very well.
And she was as good a fiddler, as all her brothers."
"My girlfriend for Christmas last year, decided to take me to Disneyland in Florida, I'm not sure whether it's Disneyland or Disneyworld.
And, um, we went down there for, a four day vacation.
And I was kind of tentative about going down because I was like ""ah Disneyland it's a little place for kids.""  but, uh, she's like nah nah nah just come just come, cuz she's been there before.
She knew what would happen.
Uh, we got down there and, it was just amazing.
I just became a little kid all over again.
I had the greatest time.
Um, the rides, the rides I mean, the roller coaster rides, they weren't that great.
They were, you know, they were roller coaster rides, you can get anywhere.
But the atmosphere in Disneyworld or Disneyland, whatever it is, is just one of such utter happiness.
People go there just_ and they're just happy.
It, it really was one of the greatest places I've ever been to.
Um, seeing the characters, you would think they are just for the kids, but they are not.
There were adults on line, waiting to see these characters as much as the little kids were.
I was one of them.
I saw Mickey Mouse, I was_ I just got all choked up when I met Mickey Mouse.
More so than I would, I would get choked up if I met, uh, a, a pro- a professional like football player.
Um, the food was great.
The people were just so nice.
Um, the people who worked at Disney, were so nice.
They were so accommodating.
Um, it really was the greatest time.
Uh, there's a, there's a park in Disney called Epcot Center.
And, I went there, and, it's, it's, um, it's, it's a park.
And in each section of the park, there is a different country.
It, it represents a different country.
And in each country they go all out.
People who work there are all from that country.
So you might have like_ picture the park as like a big circle, and, like a big_ like a clock.
And one o'clock there is one country, two o'clock is another country.
And we, would, we visited all the countries.
And when you are in the park, in that country, you really believe you are in the country.
The people, all speak the lan- like they're all from that country.
And, the culture is so rich in each one and is so diverse.
And you can go from Mexico, to Italy, to China, to Japan, to America, to Canada, to Norway.
And we went for all of these.
It was such a_ an enriching experience.
By far the greatest_ it was only four days and, um, the only problem with it was that you need about four months to actually be there and soak it all in.
It was a great vacation and I can't wait to go back."
"Uh, this summer i spent a week in France.
It was my first time ever, being there.
And French was the foreign language that i, that i studied in school for about, seven or eight years.
Um, so i was really psyched to, to go and, finally go to the country where i had studied the language.
But it was going to be real challenge to be able to really understand it.
When i heard real French people.
Um, the problem was, that i was staying with an American.
So anyway first of all, we were coming from London.
We took the, the  underground, the chu- the, uh, whatever they call it, under the Channel, the train.
And,uh, we got out,into France.
And it looked different.
The sky was a slightly different color.
They had poppies.
It was really nice.
Um... And i wasn't really understanding a whole lot, of the French.
But i was definitely, you know, when you hear it you start thinking it, kinda wanting to speak it.
Uh, but i was staying with an American.
And, so it wasn't really as much practice as i should've been getting.
And the other problem was that, i was staying with one person.
And i had to spend the whole time with this one guy.
And that wasn't really, the best hehe situation that that it could have been for us at that time.
For me, i don't know i_ it would have been better with a bigger group.
Um, but we did spend one night at <i>soiree</i> [a French word] a real_ you know all the different courses.
And, the two of us sat with these two, um, young French guys and we talked the whole night.
And, the next day i was_ the day for_ that i had to go home.
By that time, i was understanding, all the announcements on the train, you know, i could say anything.
I could, understand you know, much more, of what i was hearing.
And i could just talk about anything with, with anyone.
And the thing i learnt is that in a foreign country, it's not about the words that you say, it's all sign language."
"Not too long ago, i had the opportunity, to travel to Paris, on a trip with a choir.
It was really great.
I have to say Paris is a beautiful city.
I really like... All the downtown area, it was really beautiful.
And i had the opportunity to take a train ride and, meet up with some people, in a, suburb of Paris which was also really pretty.
It was a lot of fun for me because, i did study French for a long time, and, i very rarely get the opportunity to use it.
And one thing that was a kind of a surprise, there were only two of us in the group that knew French really well, and so i ended up being re- interviewed on Radio France. "
"One summer i was working for a family, um, baby-sitting two girls.
And their father was a professional bike rid- bike racer.
And, um, they just said &quot;do you want to go to Vermont.
&Quot; i said &quot;sure.
&Quot; so they said they're driving.
And i said &quot;fine.
&Quot; so i sat in the back with the kids for the ride.
We went there and stayed_ we stayed in a beautiful like three-bedroom, like, villa type place.
And it was gorgeous, and the mountains and hills.
The bike races were up like mountains.
And these bike_ these racers were just wonderful.
I mean they had to be wond- in wonderful shape to go_ make it up one of these.
And you know, i i actually got to try to get up one of them.
It didn't work.
But um i got to hike up one.
And it was wonderful.
I love hiking.
I found that i loved it, by doing it there.
The air was wonderful.
Um... During the day, we got to go out, into like other towns, other than Killington, which is uh_ like Vermont is north east coast.
And i had never been really up there before, so it was, it was quite different, like i didn't hear any like different talk or anything.
But you can tell it was different.
Um, it w- the towns were wonderful round there.
I found a wonderful sh- vintage shop.
They had this long vest with little shingles that was like seventies or sixties or something.
And i loved it and i got it.
And it was wonderful.
And, toward the end of the trip, i was little bored just because of the races, he was out there quite a bit often.
And, i was in the house or outside, playing with the kids.
And_ but the trip on, on the whole was wonderful i think.
Just to go to Vermont and... The air.
It was all different.
But i really enjoyed it."
"I wake up every morning at about six o'clock or six thirty.
I do that automatically.
The first thing i do is to turn on the radio to listen to the news and see what's happened.
And then i look to see what time it is.
Then i get up and make coffee.
And once i have my coffee i go back upstairs, and i turn on my computer and i start writing, in my journal, while i am drinking my coffee.
And after i do that i pay my bills and take care of what other_ whatever household things i have to do, like i might sweep the floor or, just clean up a little bit.
Then i take a shower and get dressed.
Then after i do that i go back downstairs and i cook something to bring for lunch.
And sometimes i just bring leftovers from the night before.
But sometimes i'll make, rice and vegetables.
And then i get in my car and drive about,ten minutes or so to work.
I work at a small publishing company outside of Princeton.
The first thing i do when i get to work is check my e-mail.
And i read my letters and then, i answer them.
And then i start doing_ like i look at my daily schedule and see what needs to be done.
First if anything's an emergency.
And then after a couple hours i go to lunch.
I either eat lunch... Or i go and run errands on my lunch break.
Like i might go to the health food store and pick up stuff that i need.
And then after that i come back and work for another, couple of hours.
And then i leave work about five thirty, drive back home, get home, hehe, watch the Simpsons and Seinfeld.
And after that, sometimes i meet a friend, for a drink or something, beer, coffee or whatever, or walk around.
But after that i usually just read, for a while, and then i go back upstairs and go to bed."
"My husband with_ was with the International Harvester, Company and occasionally we would win a- an all expense paid trip to some fabulous place.
We... Went to Montreal, um, Puerto Rico, but one of the, uh, most fun trips was to Mexico City.
Uh, what's interesting about that city is that, it was built on an_ over an underground lake_ on an underground lake.
And through the years, people drawing water out of the lake, caused it_ the ground to sink.
So that the whole city is sinking.
And all of the businesses... You step down into.
For instance, you_ you're on the side walk and you go down steps into the, uh, store.
And the big hotels, uh, can't be built unless they're on jacks.
So they can keep jacking them up, which was interesting.
We were there around Christmas time.
And it was nice and warm and, um, the- they decorate beautifully.
They really believe in Christmas down there.
And we went on, um, little trips around to see where the Incas wa- were.
And all of the things they built.
And there was one special, plantation that had a swimming pool that i know was a- an acre.
It was so huge, and had all kinds of, um, waterfalls and things in it.
It was very entertaining.
And of course there's the silver down there.
You get this Mexican silver and there are vendors everywhere, selling it.
Plus all of the untreated wool products, their capes, and jackets, and... And bags, and so forth.
And it's kinda fun to shop down there, but, um, you never know when the electricity's going to go out of course, and if you are on the thirteenth floor, you'r, hahaha, in a pickle and it's, breakfast time, haha.
Or if you want to take a shower you have to shower in the dark.
But, um_ and when you do go take your own washcloth because they don't furnish you with those.
I guess they get stolen all the time.
Their breakfasts' are interesting with all, the traditional Spanish things.
I've forgotten some of the names of them, eggs werewo- i can't even pronounce it.
I had two years of Spanish in college and i can barely remember si si, hahaha.
But, um, if you ever get a chance go to Mexico City."
"I have been to many states.
I've been to Ohio, mostly_ i've been to Vermont, um, New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and San Francisco.
Now  San Francisco is you know out of that little circle.
And um, the way i got there was my, my best friend, Betsy Smith, she has Down's Syndrome.
And, she, she's a beautiful person.
I love her so much.
But, um, when i first met her, she invited me to go do a talk with her, about inclusion and how, she was included in this_ our school system in Montclair.
Um, this_ after that talk we did, they liked us so much that they invited us to San Francisco to do a_ to talk for the international group of people.
And you know, i just was so excited because  i was only like maybe fourteen.
And, i had never been, you know, in a, on a plane before.
And i'd never been to the West Coast before.
And you know, it was a wonderful experience for me and I just_  we, um, got on the plane, and we got over there.
And kind of this was, was_ this huge hotel.
I know it was a Marriott, beautiful hotel.
And_ i mean i_ they told me it would be warm.
But i_ you know it wasn't that warm because i only brought like one sweater.
And you know, i had to wear that most of the time, because that wasn't warm.
It was foggy, definitely.
I heard that about San Francisco.
Um, but it was really cold.
When i woke up in the morning it was freezing because the window was open in the hotel.
Um... But we got out there, and we we got to, you know, travel a little.
We got to go on that really a long windy road, i forgot about, what it was called.
But it's a windy road and it's long.
And, the hills were_ oh my god.
And we got to see the house, um, where Mrs.
Doubtfire was taped.
Oh that was wonderful.
And i was just scared of the hills because they were so steep.
I could imagine like being on, roller blades or something_ and being on top of one of those hills and actually going down.
And not being able to stop because it's so steep.
Um... We didn't get to go over that, that swingy bridge.
It was a red_ it's a red big bridge.
Bay Bridge maybe.
I don't know.
But we didn't get to_ but i got to see it though, i got a picture of it also.
And we got to go to sh_ um, Fisherman's Wharf and, some other really cool places.
And they have some great stores down there.
And i bought two dresses.
And one i actually got to wear.
The other one my mom told me &quot;no, you can't wear that&quot; cuz it was black and it was_ it has a little slit, and it wasn't that big.
And she was so_ she just said &quot;you're just too young for that dress.
&Quot; it was long too.
Um, but when i left there, it was just beautiful to, to see everything.
And, and just going over all the land was just wonderful.
So, it was a good experience to see that side of the United States."
"My husband and i were traveling, in Africa.
And, we were staying in, a government guest house which was, sort of like a small hotel, but it a wasn't a very fancy place.
Anyway it was a very hot... Uh, night that night.
It was a very hot climate and it was really hot that night.
And we wanted to have the windows open.
But the problem was, we had everything we owned right there in the room.
And the windows didn't have any screens or anything.
So anybody could just, come right in, and steal our things.
But if we shut the windows, it would be impossible to sleep, it was, way over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit or forty degrees centigrade.
So we decided to put a lot of pots and pans and things like that, under the window.
So then if a thief came in, the pots and pans would fall down, and we'd wake up.
So that's what we did.
Anyway... We were asleep.
All of the sudden in the middle of the night... Sure enough, i hear the pans, crash.
I sat up in bed, my heart was beating like anything.
I could see that there was, a man in a white robe, standing up next to the bed.
I tried to scream... And, i had laryngitis which means my voice wasn't working.
And i was screaming in the local language fo- for help.
It was like 'help help'.
But i couldn't scream.
And so the man came over, and he shoved me down on the bed.
And then he says in English &quot;be quiet.
&Quot; and then i realized it was my husband, huh.
And when i was able to speak, i said &quot;what are you doing.
&Quot; he said &quot;well, i had a headache and i wanted to get up and get some aspirins.
&Quot;"
"Hi.
My name is Sis... And i would like to speak to you and tell you a little bit about myself.
I was born in a little town of Parkland, Pennsylvania.
And as i was growing up we didn't have all the facilities, modern facilities as they have in homes today.
I-  we used to have to walk across the, park and pump our water, to drink.
And to bathe.
And to wash our clothes.
And also we had to carry the heat_ the coal from the outside, to feed the pot belly stove.
There isn't many people today that really know what a pot belly stove is.
But that was our way of heating the house.
We cooked on a kerosene stove and we had this, metal thing that we used to sit on top of the burner, which was our oven.
And that's how we did our baking.
And i remember the old refrigerator... In the house had a motor on top of it.
And i think if anybody had to remove that from that house it must have taken about ten men to walk out the door with that thing, it was so huge and so thick with insulation.
I_ it was a small town i came from.
And i, was involved with our church.
I am from a Presbyterian, religious sect.
And i sang in the church choir as a grew older.
I became a Sunday School teacher and when i moved from Parkland, i had moved up to a town up towards Walgrove Pennsylvania.
And i had met my husband and i had three children.
I have two sons, and i have a daughter.
And i have four grandchildren.
I have three granddaughters and a new grandson.
Finally God blessed me with a grandson.
And... Then from there i have moved over here to New Jersey.
About thirty-two years ago.
And i gave birth to my daughter and she is, from New Jersey.
And she has Samantha and Breanna.
And Samantha's in her terrible teens of seventeen.
She's got a young fellow that she likes very much.
And she will be graduating next year from high school.
And her field that she wants to go in- into college i believe will be social work.
For psychology and counseling troubled teenagers.
Which i am very proud of.
And, Breanna, she's just like her grandmom, the tomboy of the family.
Haha.
Melanie, she is kinda quiet.
And, well Andrew all he can do is cry and screech and smile and blow bubbles at you now because he's still small."
"When i was ten years old i was sent to a convent in Sussex.
At first it seemed like a really good idea.
But, when, the day came for me to go, reality dawned.
And, it was, probably one of the_ my worst days i have ever had.
Leaving home and leaving your parents.
It was_ when you're a child, it was just terrible.
I hated it.
Um, but i was only there for a year, because i didn't settle down at all.
Um, and in that year, um, it was just the worst year of my life i think.
And it's, sort of, affected me i suppose, in... In ways it shouldn't of.
Um, it was run by_ it was a convent.
It was sort of_ no, it was run by nuns.
And, uh, it was_ they were the most inhumane sort of, group of people i've, i've ever come across.
And, they acted so bitter.
And, um, they were just so, horrid.
I, i can't sort of, explain.
And, to get away from it, i used to, play the piano.
And i'd hide myself away, in the piano rooms.
Um... And escape i suppose.
And then, also playing tennis.
And, i had ways of, trying to cope with it, um, obviously, when we weren't having lessons.
And i used to look forward to going to sleep because it was, when i was on my own.
Um, i always remember one crate that_ one of the nuns who used to, um, sleep next to me.
She had a sort of_ we all had a corridor.
And, um, we, we slept sort of in a communal, um, corridor.
There were, um, about twenty beds in.
And, um, she was brushing my hair, late one night.
And, um, i was very excited because my father was coming at the weekend.
And, he was, um, going to take me camping.
And so i was relieved that i would not be staying, that weekend in the school.
And i explained this to the nun.
She was brushing my hair, and she said, 'never plan ahead.
You never know when you might die.
' I told my father this, and, um, he was outraged.
And, promptly took me out of the school."
"Environmentalism, is... Actually a relatively easy subject to talk about, but much harder to put into practice.
Because many of the things... That would be... That would best_ that would be best to, uh... Many of the things that would help the environment the most are actually the hardest to do.
Because, for example we depend on cars so much... But cars are one of the biggest contributors to depletion of the ozone layer, to air pollution.
Uh... And but yet at least we in America could not live without our cars.
It's something that I've experienced myself.
I did not have a car until I was twenty-five.
And I got along quite well without one, although I had to get rides sometimes from other people.
But as soon as I bought a car I would feel, helpless without one.
As when I had to have my car, as when it_ if I ever had to have my car at the mechanics, in the shop to be worked on, I couldn't wait to have that car back.
But, these cars that we Americans have, we are dependent on them.
Most of, most of us us don't live in big cities with excellent transportat- public transportation.
But we need to get around and we ameri- we Americans... Uh,really depend on our cars.
But... It would be to real- to, to deal with this problem we would have to rearrange American society.
And that would be a very difficult thing.
But it is necessary, nevertheless, because we only have one planet as the cliche goes.
And, we need to do something about it.
We need to, we need to identify the problems.
And we need, to address them.
For example, the issue of endangered species.
There are a lot of people who say, ""well there're sp_ species have always gone extinct and they are going to continue to go extinct"".
But the problem is that if we just let species die, and we don't address the problems that are, causing these species to die.
We may be affecting our own future as well.
And we do not know, how complicated the food chain is for example.
If ,if a species of frogs say in Florida went extinct, it might affect the whole food chain.
And it might cause, for all we know, it might cause, a serious disaster that would affect, human kind in a very serious way.
And so... No matter how difficult it is... And it may be true that some species just have to, uh, just have to go by the way side, sometimes we cannot necessarily save, every species on earth.
But we need to take this very seriously.
We need to take the environment, seriously because, it is our only home.
And... Affecting one part of the environment, could cause the rest of it, to collapse or to become damaged, uh, beyond what we can repair."
"I was originally trained as an actor.
Uh, i left school quite early and went to drama school.
And then i worked, a bit in repertory and a few bits and pieces on television, for a few years.
And then, for various reasons, i had a_ a quite a long break and did other things.
And then when i came to Oxford as a mature student i, got involved in university drama.
Because Oxford drama is sort of one of the highlights of the, the Oxford scene, and Oxford life.
And, although i originally had, not intended to do this i found myself being pulled into the scene.
And, um, and then found myself wanting to get back into that, kind of life.
Because i think once, it’s in your blood, it remains in your blood.
It's there all the time.
It’s some_ it’s like a bug you can’t get rid off.
Um, and so i’ve been trying to work my way back, into, the business.
Um, which is not as exciting and as glamorous as people often think.
It’s jolly hard work.
There’s a lot of expense.
You’ve got a lot of outlay.
You’ve got to have photographs.
Pay to get into the Spotlight directory, which is the film and TV directory.
Which if you’re serious about the business you’ve got to get yourself into.
Because it’s sent round to everyone.
And trying to find agents and all this kind of thing.
But also too that_ um, i mean for instance i_ when i say people think it’s all glamorous and exciting_ the other week i was doing um a little bit of filming, locally at, um, a stately home here.
Uh, just out said Thame.
And, unfortunately, i don’t actually agree with it, but at the moment, because i’m desperate to get money, haha, and also to get myself seen.
I’m, um, sort of taking things which, some years ago when i started off i would have never have dreamed of doing.
'Cause Equity unfortunately now has very little control.
And what these companies tend to do now is they advertise, in local papers and, uh, publications saying that they’re going to be doing some filming and they’re having general castings at, a local pub or wherever.
And, um, i went along to one of these local castings, and of course all these local yokels, as i rather patronisingly term them, had turned up as well.
Um, and, uh, i mean there were one or two people like myself who had professional experience.
But, the vast majority were all these, um, local yo_ local yokels, um, thinking they’d get a bit of excitement.
Um, anyway, i was actually then rung up a few days later.
And, um, asked if i would, do a scene.
She said that she couldn’t give me a professional contract.
But could only pay me the peanuts they were paying, uh, hehe, everyone else.
But they wanted me because of my experience to do a scene with this particular actor who’s quite well known.
In a dinner party scene.
And, um, would i do it.
And as i say i’m trying to get back.
And at the moment i just thought, the experience of doing it, and you know and meeting people and all the rest of it would be quite handy.
So i said yes.
Um, i had to go along for a costume fitting.
And, um, there were some people_ other people who were going to be in the scene.
And some other scenes there then.
'Cause it’s, it’s actually set in the eighteenth century this particular, film they’re making.
And, um, i think people were really surprised at_ this was just simply the costume fitting.
Let alone when we got to the shooting in the following week.
And the hanging around and waiting.
And, you know, people we- were sitting around feeling really bored.
And i think, “oh this is so boring.
Waiting for hours till you were called to be fitted, and all the rest of it.
&Quot; and so, let alone when we actually had to the shooting, and be up at the crack of dawn.
When you have a 7 o'clock start.
And you’ve got to get yourself there.
And, um, i think people found this wasn’t quite as romantic as they thought.
And particularly then when you've had to be there for 7 o'clock in order to be dressed.
So that you were all ready by 9 o'clock.
Um, and that, that didn’t mean you were going to start at nine.
In fact we_ our particular scene wasn’t used till after lunch.
So in actual fact we had to disrobe part of our costumes.
So we didn’t get our lunch all spilt down them.
But our wig and our makeup had all been done.
And i, i they were just si_ sitting around yawning and this.
They wanted to smoke.
They weren’t allowed to smoke.
Which i was jolly glad about 'cause i can’t stand people who smoke.
But people were really, i think, quite surprised that they had sit around.
And they had to be quiet.
They couldn’t make a noise.
Because noise just carries so much.
Any sound will carry over.
And, people were feeling really, i think, rather restless and tired.
And thought that for the peanuts they were being paid, um, perhaps it wasn’t so glamorous.
And and then, when we actually got round to shooting the scene.
Um, oh they were all animated in between when they were meant to being_ uh, be quiet.
And, and, uh, were sort of talking and chatting.
And trying to talk to the a_ leading actors.
Which of course is a no-no.
You do not speak to unless you are spoken to.
Let alone try to make clever jokes and, assume a familiarity.
Which, um, one would_ just wouldn’t assume.
Even actually i knew one of the actors 'cause i, i know him from, uh, something else, um, that i’m involved in.
But even i didn’t speak to him till he spoke to me first.
And here were all these people_ and some of them were getting so, annoyed about this.
But, um, anyway, they were all animated as i say before they actually sh- shot the scene.
But then when they actually wanted to shoot the scene, of us, having conversation over a dinner party and, being entertaining and amusing and listening to the principal actors.
They were just sort of struck like lumps of wood of course.
And, um, uh, you know, and they had to keep doing retake, um, after retake.
Which is one my points.
I always think.
They should use professional actors, because it, it wastes so much more time in the end when you use, people who haven’t got experience.
Um, so, i think they were quite surprised these people.
And found it wasn’t quite what they expected.
Um, and they’ll probably find too that their little bit is actually edited out, and you’ll probably only see me talking to the principal actors in the end."
"My last holiday.
My last proper holiday was, um, i think about two years ago.
When i went to stay, on a friend's parents' boat.
And that was down in the Caribbean.
And we flew down there.
I, and, uh, two other friends.
Gavin, who's very big, and, uh, i- it was his parents that owned the boat.
And Charlie, who's another friend.
And Zach, my little one.
Zach was about three and a half then, i think.
Oh, no, no, i think he was coming up for four.
Something like that anyway.
Um, so we flew out there.
And, uh, we stayed on this boat, went cruising around.
And in the mornings we'd get up.
Zach would have breakfast.
And he'd always be in a hurry to get down to the beach.
So then we'd get in the dinghy.
And we'd go up to an island, and he'd play, for the morning.
And that would get him out of everyone else's, sort of hair and they'd_ could carry on sleeping in or whatever.
And i'd just sort of lie on the beach.
And, just carry on making parenting noises every so often, when Zach wanted something.
Um, it was really good.
We stayed there for six weeks and went snorkelling.
Um, Zach would swim in the sea everyday, and get a thorough dunking at least twice a day.
But he seemed to love it.
He remembers the palms trees, and crabs.
He remembers, fish in the sea that he could see.
Um, what else can he remember.
He remembers his birthday.
We had the, i_ it was his birthday.
His birthday fell, while we were on holiday.
And we, bought a cake from some restaurant.
Zach went down to, um, an ice cream parlour.
While we snuck the cake onboard.
Bought all these presents and things.
And, found a musical candle somewhere.
It was this appalling candle.
You lit it and, it didn't play_ did it play happy birthday.
Or, merry Christmas.
Something like that.
One or the other.
And, and i remember i_ we, we have photos.
He just looks, he looks so wired.
He'd had_ in, in these pictures.
He'd sort of spent the day eating sugar and, and chocolate, and this that and the other.
And he was all hyper.
And there's his cake, and he's just screaming, 'yeah...' And, that was a good day."
"Alex... Was in college at a very early age.
He wound up in medical school.
And that was all he was_ uh, early twenties, medical school.
And, uh, he needed a car.
He's very good on cars.
And he needed to buy himself a new car.
Where he got the money from, I don't know.
But he bought a brand new car.
Out on the west coast.
A red one, cuz, I had said to him once, that red cars are safer on the road you cannot miss seeing them.
Bright red and I didn't mean it to be as bright red as he got.
But anyway, he parked it somewhere near home.
And, uh, this was on the west coast near his home and school.
And somebody rammed into it.
And dented the door, they_ from what I understand, I never saw it, but they did a, good job.
And I still don't understand how it worked out.
But he convinced the manufacturers, the distributor, whatever.
That it would be cheaper for them to give him a new model car like it than to fix the old one.
And that's what he's got without a nickel."
"I play soccer each week, and i'll tell you, a story about something that_ which happened last week at one of the games.
It was very late in the game, and everyone was very tired, and i was very tired.
I was back on defense, protecting the goal so the other team couldn't get a, a late goal.
However, the other team had a break away.
They had gotten it so that just two of their players, were against myself.
So it was two players with the ball against me, only me between them and the goal.
And they were coming at me and i was very tired and i was going to do my best to try to and keep this ball out of the goal, in what could have been the very last play of the game.
One of them shot, and he shot right between my legs.
As best as i could, even though i was so tired, i tried to bring my legs together.
But the ball, uh, hit one of my legs or hit both legs, and kept going through, because he had hit it so hard.
So this is very embarrassing in soccer to have this, sort of thing happen.
For the ball to go right through your legs.
And, the most embarrassing thing perhaps to have is to have go through your legs and into the goal.
And then right at the end of the game.
That's just horrible to have, the game end like that.
So the ball hit my legs, went... Through my legs and i turned and saw it was going into the goal.
The worst thing i could imagine to happen.
So with very little energy, i knew i had to just try and  get that ball from going in.
So i just sp- spun, i began running as fast as i can with my tired legs... To try and get this ball out of the goal.
I knew that i have to run get, on the other side of it, kick it away, and save the goal.
But the next thing i noticed, the next moment, less than a second later, was that the ball was going right towards the corner of the goal, so right towards the post of the goal.
I knew that i would have to, move as fast as i could, sprint after the ball, get around it, kick it, out of the goal, and not, hit this post, this metal post of the goal.
And what ended up happen was that i got to it.
I cleared the ball, kicked it away from the goal and i slammed into the post, it was an ex- just an explosion of, of, of energy in this, this final play with very little energy left in my body.
And it all seemed to come out in just this violent impact between human being, soccer ball and goal post.
And what happened in the dust on the field was that you saw, a ball go flying outwards, saved from the goal, a human body slam into a metal post, drop flat onto the ground on its back.
And then this metal goal, which wasn't anchored in the ground just shift back, just move back, several feet from the impact.
And one of my teammates came running over and, hehe, he said “what's harder the the goal post or your leg.
&Quot; and, uh, i said “ well is there any blood.
&Quot; and he said &quot;no&quot; and i said &quot;well then, it's ok.
&Quot; and so there was no goal and, uh, no broken leg either."
"What is alternative medicine.
Well usually when people get sick, they go to the doctor and.. They get surgery, or they get a pain killer.
Or they get some kind of medication, that has a lot of side effects.
But alternative medicine is where instead of, doing those things, you try to treat the whole... Body using, maybe herbs, uh, or acupuncture, or even... Different types of yoga breathing.
Um, hm, it's a little bit hard to explain.
I guess mostly the herbal thing is a, a, a large part of it.
But it, gets into, deeper theories where they, talk about the body's entire system being out of balance.
So, i- if you get a headache, it might not be the thing to do to just take a painkiller, but find out at, wh- what level your body is, uh, out of balance and correct that."
"Hello.
My name is Amanda, and I live here in Oxford, very close to the river.
In a beautiful flat which is, uh, the top, flat.
And I always joke and call it my penthouse flat.
Because I have a wonderful view overlooking, the hills around Oxford and I can see as far as Boars Hi-, Boars Hill on a clear day.
And at the side.
Uh, view from my roof terrace balcony I can see the river, and watch the boats going by, and the college crews, uh, rowing up there.
And people punting in the summer too.
And, I also have my little pussy cat.
A little black and white cat who is the queen of the rooftops.
She was living semi-wild for a couple of years out on Grandpont nature park.
Which is immediately outside my flat.
And that is a, a beautiful, park which has been cultivated especially with wildflowers, and plants.
To encourage, wildlife and local butterf- butterflies_ to, um, encourage them, there.
And, um, she lived out there rough for a couple of years.
Because she was the runt of the litter.
Having been born in a flat beneath me.
And, um, the other cats there_ there were eight other cats chased her away.
And the poor little thing was living, as I say, semi-rough for two years.
And used to mew pathetically at any one going by.
And eventually, um, I became a real soft touch.
And she, adopted me and kept coming in for odd days.
And of course then, eighteen months ago, she came to stay permanently.
And, um, her name is called Poppy.
Like a flower, poppy.
That was the name she was given by the person who, um, had her originally.
And she's now, four years old.
She was four on the thirty-first of May.
And from being a really timid, nervous little cat, very scruffy with a poor coat, she's, now got the most beautiful glossy black and white coat.
And is so playful.
And becomes more and more &quot;kittenish&quot;.
She plays with everything_ she's got loads of toys.
More toys than many little children have,  hehe, i'm sure.
And she is so playful where as when she first came to me, she wouldn't run after a ball or, play with anything at all.
But now she’s so kittenish and she’s great company."
"When i got my flat a f- a few years ago after I had graduated as a student.
I found i had this beautiful large roof terrace.
And, i was a person who as a child hated gardening.
I never had anything to do with gardening.
And i thought well i, i need to do something with this space 'cause it seemed a shame just to waste it.
So apart from getting a table and some chairs, i thought i must have some pots and put some plants in them.
And gradually i became more and more interested.
So that now it's almost become an obsession.
I have built, or constructed a real roof terrace garden.
Um, i've got a bird bath and lots of, uh, stone animals and, and tubs, and creeping plants, roses and, passion flowers and Clematis climbing up the balcony.
And, um, then i use the sloping roof as well with containers.
And, and in the summer we_ i have hanging baskets.
And i've got shrubs and all sorts of things.
And, almost every inch of space is now covered with, um, containers of one shape or another.
And, a few years ago, uh, when i first started doing this.
Um, i was_, it was suggested to me i enter 'Oxford in Bloom'.
And i thought, &quot;oh i can't do this.
I know nothing about gardening&quot;.
But i got quite interested.
And, um, i sort of managed to get, enough things together for the first year.
And i was amazed when i got, um, an award.
A certificate.
And then i've entered now for several years.
And i, i always get, um, a certificate or a prize.
And it's, it's quite exciting really.
Um, i wasn't able to enter last year cause i had, um, an injury and so i wasn't fit enough to do it but i'm hoping to enter again this year.
And it just be- takes over so much of your life.
And i've learnt now so much about plants.
And, and also about all the, bugs and insects.
And what you have to do to try and, um, uh, stop them taking over your plants.
And i prefer to try and, do things naturally and organically where possible.
Rather than using sprays and insecticides and- which harm the environment.
And also_ although i also have a cat.
I also have a a number of birds that come and feed up there.
I always make sure the cat is not outside, haha, on the roof, haha, when they do come.
So i like to encourage all the birds th- there too cause, um, uh there's finches and sparrows and tits, and, um, robins and blackbirds.
All sorts of birds come.
And, um, so as i say i like to try and use, um, natural means to, um, get rid of all the bugs.
And the_ 'cause actually the birds, they're also another mea- natural means too.
Cause they do come and pick off some of the aphids that, uh, might be on my roses.
Um, so i've i've really found it really interesting learning about all the different sort of plants.
And each year i try and build up a bit more.
And experiment with more unusual plants and shrubs.
And, um, it’s become quite a real hobby of mine now."
"Okay, I'm gonna say a few words about the food here in America.
Um, I love it.
Uh haha very, very Americanized I am.
I, I realize it, and I am, just lost to it.
The food here, um, there's, there's an underlying theme of quickness and, uh, cheap food.
And, a lot of people don't like it.
I love it.
I, uh, I love, I love Burger Kings, I love McDonalds.
I'll probably pay for it later in life with, uh, like a massive heart attack or something.
But, uh, I love the food.
I think, I even think it tastes great.
Um, I love going out to restaurants, to, um, less quick food.
But, um, I love having people cook for me here.
Ah, going out to restaurants with my girlfriend's something we do like, two, three, four times a week.
Although it could be pretty expensive.
But it's_ I think it's worth it.
Eating, eating here in America, isn't as much a social thing as I hear it is in other countries.
Although I haven't visited many other countries.
And, um, but eating is something everyone loves to do.
Well... I love to do.
Um, some of my favorite foods are hamburgers, pizza.
I think a hamburger might be the world's most perfect food, although some people mi- would disagree.
Um, I love the taste of it.
Um, I'm a big meat eater, a big beef eater.
Um, i, I wouldn't be able to give it up.
I'm, i.m very addicted to it.
I think it just tastes good.
I know it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world, but... There's my American attitude."
"I am a, fourth year student at the College of New Jersey.
And, a year consists of two semesters.
For the past seven semesters, i've had a trouble coming up with the money that i need to pay my bill.
Every semester it's a struggle paying my bill, paying my bill.
This semester, um, i'm twenty-four years old, and the government deems me financially independent.
And because of that they give me_  they gave me a lot of grants this year.
I wasn't aware of that.
And, when i went to pay my bill this semester, which i've had to, work to come up with the money that i owed.
I thought i owed about three hundred dollars.
I walked into the place where i pay the bill, and got the bill.
And it said eight hundred dollars.
And i started to getting really angry wondering why i owed so much money.
When in fact they told me that, that was the money that they owed me.
I was getting a refund because, of the government, grants that i had.
So that kind of made my day very nice."
"Let me tell you another interesting story about my son, Alex.
Uh... First, i have to tell you.
He worked for his father summers.
His father had his own milk company.
Milk del- home delivery.
You used to get milk at home everyday.
Or if there was businesses that want regular deliveries, he did that too.
Now where we lived... I- in Spring Valley, New York, is a um_ was a resort area there were lots of hotels, a lot of camps for children.
And in the summer there was a separate route for the summer business.
And Alex took care of it.
And he must've been, sixteen, seventeen years old.
He had a license at sixteen.
It wasn't much later.
And he was driving the milk truck with the electric refrigerator over the cab, in front.
A new one, with a brand new refrigerator on it.
And he forgot, and went under a tunnel on his regular route, and smashed the refrigerator.
Because he drove right into this stone concrete structure and, and he smashed the refrigerator.
Now he's petrified.
He's worried his father is going to be upset.
Came home, came upstairs and got a rope that the_ what was left of a rope we tied a tree back with.
So that the tree shouldn't fall on the house.
It was a very heavy rope.
And he went downstairs and tied the truck to the tree.
Downstairs, diagonally across the road.
It's now getting to be a little dark.
People are coming home from work.
And for some strange reason they had to use this road to get home.
And our truck is there diagonally across the street.
And no lights are on the street, the light was way down.
And i'm sitting there watching him, &quot;what are you doing, what are you doing.
&Quot; &quot;i'm going to pull the grill work out.
&Quot; the tree was gonna pull_ he was going to back up the track and pull the grill work out.
In the middle of all this, his sister called me from college.
She was away at college.
And she says, &quot;ma you sound bad, what's wrong.
&Quot; I says &quot;listen to what your brother's doing&quot; and she k- says, &quot;stay on the phone ma i'll talk you through it.
&Quot; she knows him, and she knew what was going to happen.
In the middle of all this, he comes up stairs and goes to take a shower.
And the truck is still across the road.
I said &quot;Alex, don't leave the truck there, it's gonna get hit, a cars gonna_&quot; &quot;i won't be long, ma, i'm too over heated, i'm too sweaty, i got to take a shower.
I'll go back and continue&quot;, which is exactly what happened.
Well P-S the grill work stayed where it was.
Fortunately nobody decided to use our street and his father didn't even get upset.
Cuz it_ i don't know, maybe he thought Alex was a saint.
Alex could do no wrong.
So everything worked out fine.
But that, hour, more than an hour sitting and watching him in the twilight, trying to pull the grill work out of the car must-ve taken a couple years off of my life."
" hello, my name's Art.
I'm seventy-four years old.
And i'd like to talk about my passion for golf.
Sometimes, it's called an addiction, because i play everyday weather permitting.
Uh, i usually play with the same group of fellas, uh, Jack, Len and Andy.
Uh, we make up a team, and then we have a lot of fun playing a match.
We usually play the match for dimes and quarters.
What we do is we, uh, set... Have a set of four holes.
The team winning the most holes, wins the quarter.
As we are playing, there is a lot of heckling going on.
Uh... You, talk about the fellow when he is about make his putt, say to him be careful how hard you hit the ball, so to make sure it goes in the hole.
Uh, anyway, playing golf is really a fun game. "
"Okay, now I'm going to talk about how to make bread at home.
Um... I don't like to use, a machine.
I do it all with my hands.
Um... All you do is take some flour, and some water and yeast.
And first you put the yeast in the water, uh, and that makes it wake up, and you give it some, some sugar to eat or some honey, and that makes it, it wake up and start growing.
And then you mix together, some flour, and you can use different kinds of flour, uh, like white or whole-wheat.
And then, uh, you put the water with the yeast in it into the flour and mix it all up.
And then, uh, you knead it.
You mush it around, and kinda, mix it up.
And then you let it sit.
And then, uh, that's the part where I clean up, and go do something else.
And that's why baking bread, although, although it takes a really long time, it takes all day, but, you don't have to_ you can do other things.
So then after, uh, after a while you come back to the dough and it's grown.
It's, it's twice the size of, the last time.
So you punch it down, mush it up, knead it again, let it grow again.
And then finally you, uh, shape it and make it into loaves that are the way_ the shape that you want them to be.
And put them in the oven.
And then after an hour, you come back, and it's done.
And it is the best food in the world... Right out of the oven."
"I've been a vegetarian, since the age of twelve.
My family all decided to, change together, which I think is quite unusual.
It's my brother that suggested it.
And we all quite happily converted.
And I'm the only one at the moment who stayed a vegetarian.
My personal reasons for being a vegetarian, is I think we should respect animals.
And, and I'm happy not to eat them.
I try not to wear leather, if possible.
But at the moment I wear leather shoes.
I think it's so difficult to find, shoes that aren't, leather or suede.
I've recently started eating fish though.
I've just uh, changed my mind on fish.
But, uh, sometimes I feel a little bit guilty.
I think_ really need to find a comfortable level of, uh, animal rights, and, you know, what what feels natural for you.
Vegetarian meals are so much easier, to find in restaurants and pubs now.
And it's becoming more popular.
So it is easier to be a vegetarian, I think, than it was ten years ago.
And I love cooking, so it really isn't a problem for me now.
So, that's that's why I'm vegetarian."
"I am a woman.
Um, a French woman.
Um, but nevertheless a woman.
And, um.
. .  I’ve, uh, been brought up in a very open minded family.
And a very tolerant family.
Um... And my parents were part of the sixty-eight movement.
And my mother was a very strong feminist.
Um, she was absolutely devastated the first time a friend of hers offered me a Barbie Doll.
Um, but, um, so i’ve, i’ve been, um, raised up in this atmosphere of, respect for women.
And, um, also of the idea that, if you want_ if you work hard enough.
And if you, and if you work hard, as a woman you’ll, you’ll get what you want.
And you should get what you deserve.
And this not according your sex.
Now I have to say that, um, this is an ideal.
Um, and as a woman, I feel there is sort of segregation.
Not very strong at my level because, um, most of the people i’ve encountered so far, very intellectual people who are, um, very respectful of women.
Um, most of the men I have en- encountered had a lot of respect, for women.
Um, but, I have to say that there is still a sort of amount of, um, discrimination.
Even at the student level.
Um, first of all I have to say that, I always feel that I need to fight more, um, than a man.
In order to prove myself.
Um, and to prove that i’m right.
Now and, and also, I also have to prove that i’m strong.
Now th- this is completely, um, contradictory because, the result of this is that, often you find men, disregarding women who are strong.
Um, they say “what is this woman.
She’s behaving like a man.
She’s an iron woman.""  um, they’re often scared also by women who are strong.
Um, and, and they despise their strength.
For them sometimes a woman should be a bit more weak and under control.
Um, and they have difficulties admitting them at their level.
I also find, um, in the English, uh, student society a very interesting attitude towards women.
Um, especially in a city like Oxford.
Um, men are very, kind and respectful to women.
But in a patronising way.
Um you often find these clubs, um, these so called gentlemen’s club.
Where they, um, very, um, they’re very happy to invite women and to welcome women.
But as a result they’re all there sitting with their glass of brandy and smoking a cigar.
And basically, treating women as a lovely, um, piece of painting or whatever on the wall.
Or something decorative almost.
Now in this sort of situation, that’s_ especially when I want to behave like a man.
When I would love to take a cigar and start, and start puffing it away.
Get a glass of brandy and swear like them.
Um, but of course if I do that i’m going to be, um, considered as a vulgar person.
Um, now I don’t know who is vulgar here.
Is it, uh, me or is it them.
Who are generally in a general sense, vulgar.
Um, i’m also very aware that, um, I don’t encounter a lot of discrimination.
But if I was in a difficult, situation I would.
I have some friends who, um, have been in a very distressful situation, having no money, being in the street.
And they’ve told me... Incredible, stories um, about the abuse of power, um, that they have suffered from men.
Even for the slightest things.
For asking for allowances, for their baby or things like that.
They would be asked basically to go to bed.
Um, and this is_ this happens in France today, um.
In Paris.
Uh, it is, um, and from the lowest, the lowest man in the administrative, um, hierarchy.
Uh, up to French member of parliaments.
So, um, seeing that does not reassure me about, um, about, the way male consider women.
And, um, i, i, i’m glad that, um, i’ve a high level of education.
Um, which is_ it sort_ it is like protecting me from so much discrimination.
And, I think there is still a very long way to go, before men do actually look women in a real respectable way."
"I'd like to tell you about how they build houses, in an African village where I lived.
First, they would dig up a lot of dirt.
Then they would pour water on it, and get it wet.
They would put this mud, into, a rectangular wooden frame, the size of a brick.
Then they would pour it out on the ground to dry.
They would let the bricks dry in the sun for several days.
They called these green bricks, because they were not, baked in a fire.
They just dried in the sun.
When they got ready to build the house, they would, put four, sturdy logs, in the ground to be the four corners of the house.
They would... Lay the bricks around, making the walls of the house.
Between the bricks, they put mud, which acted as mortar.
There would be a door, and a wooden frame to hold, the door in place.
When it was time to make the roof... They would get poles, and attach them, to the logs at the corners of the house.
The poles would go up to the center making a point.
Then they would attach straw, onto the poles, and make a, lovely grass roof.
That would be a basic house.
Often, they would build more than one hut, on a, a compound for a family.
For example there would be, a small hut, for the kitchen things.
Also, it was common that, each wife would have her, own room for sleeping and the husband had his room.
The young children, slept in with their mother.
That was a typical house. "
"There was once a nobleman.
Who longed to have a son.
A son to raise up to bear his name, and look after his estates.
But he and his wife had no children.
And then at last, she gave birth.
But to a daughter.
What use, was a girl to a man like that.
He would have nothing to with her.
Had nurse maids to raise her up.
And they had to keep her out of his way.
And she was to grow up and marry the first man that came along.
Well, the first man who asked for her hand in marriage, when she got to about fifteen, or sixteen.
Why he was old, he was skinny, his eyes squinted, and she didn't wish to marry a man like that.
She couldn't think what to do.
She took herself off to the wise woman.
'Ah, my dear.
Ask for a gown of silver.
' So, she went back.
And a gown, a dress, with fine silver thread, was made.
And, oh it fitted her, and she looked pretty in it.
But she still wasn't going to marry a man like that.
Again, she went to the wise woman.
'Hm... Ask for a gown of gold.
' And a fine dress with golden thread weaved in it was made.
Oh, it suited her so well.
But, she was not going to marry a man like that.
Again, she went to the wise woman.
'Uhm... Let's test his wits, his brain, as well as his purse.
Ask for a gown of feathers.
Not just any old feathers, hen's feathers, peacock's feathers.
But feathers from all the birds of the air.
'And so, that's what she did.
And, the man must have had something going for him.
For he put food on the ground.
And as each of the birds came down, they left a feather.
Until there was a great mound of feathers.
All the colours of the rainbow, and many more besides.
And from that, a fine dress was made.
Oh, it shone in the sunlight.
But she still didn't wish to marry a man like that.
Now, i might have given up at that time.
So might you.
But, no she went again to the wise woman.
'Ah.
' Said the wise woman.
'Ask for a gown of cat skin.
' Now, you and i might not think this is very sensible, or very kind.
But, in olden days, cat skin was used.
It's a very light, fur.
Very nice to wear.
Very soft.
But of course, it takes many animals to make one such as that.
And therefore, it's very expensive.
So, she went back, and asked for a gown of cat skin.
And a great dress, a cloak-like dress was made.
Oh, it was so soft and light, and warm.
She didn't want to take it off.
But she wasn't going to marry a man like that.
All she could think to do, was to leave home.
Take all her favourite possessions, including these beautiful dresses, with her.
And leave.
And that's what she did.
And she walked for many a mile.
And many a day.
And many a week.
'Til she was in the land where she wasn't known.
And there was a great house.
And she went and hid all that she had in a cave, apart from her cat skin gown.
Because, it was so soft and warm that she kept it on.
Now she was a nobleman's daughter.
She wasn't trained up for any work.
But, she went and knocked on the door, and asked if they would at least have her as a kitchen maid.
The lowliest sort of work.
And it was agreed.
And she went to work there.
And she wouldn't say her real name.
So everybody called her Catskin.
Now, the young man of that place.
The young lord, he'd been on a journey, and was coming home.
And his parents were going to hold a ball.
Everyone, was to go to that ball.
Everyone, except Catskin.
When she asked if she could go, the cook threw a basin of water over her.
But when everyone had gone.
Catskin, crept out, went to the cave.
Got her silver dress, and put it on.
And she went to the ball.
And, oh, she was the most beautiful thing there, and the young lord he danced with her all night.
He asked where she'd came from, because he'd never seen her before.
'Oh, the Sign-of-the-basin,' she said.
Thinking of the basin of water that had been thrown over her.
But before the end of the ball, she left.
Went back to the cave.
Took off her pretty dress.
And put on her cat skin gown.
And was back in the kitchen before anyone returned.
Well, the next day, that young man, he looked everywhere for her.
No one could remember seeing her before.
No one had heard of the Sign-of-the-basin.
He persuaded his parents to hold another ball.
As before, everyone was to go.
Everyone except Catskin.
This time when she asked, the cook picked up a ladle, and hit her on the shoulder with, um, with it, and it broke.
Again, when everyone had gone, Catskin went to the cave.
And this time she put on her gown of gold, and went to the ball.
Oh, the young lord was so pleased to see her.
And he danced with her, and danced with her.
And said, 'i looked everywhere for you.
I couldn't find you.
You don't really live at the Sign-of-the-basin, where do you live.
' 'The Sign-of-the-broken-ladle,' she said.
Thinking what the cook had done.
Well, as before she left before the end.
And was back in the kitchen, before anyone came back.
And again the young lord looked for her.
And couldn't find her.
He moped around the place, as only a young man can mope around the place.
His parents wouldn't hold another ball.
But... Well... Eventually they did.
You really can't have young men behaving like that.
It_ for the sake of peace and quiet.
And they were_ held another ball.
Well, you can imagine what happened.
And this time, of course, it was that beautiful gown of feathers, that Catskin wore.
And oh, it shone like jewels in the candlelight's.
And the young man, well, he'd got his senses back.
And this time, when she left, he followed her.
Saw her go back to the cave.
Change into her cat skin gown, and go back to the kitchens.
The kitchens in his very own house.
Could she really be a kitchen maid there.
The following day, he crept down the stairs to see, and yes, there she was.
He went running to his parents, saying, 'i've found her.
I've found her.
And now i can marry her.
She's a kitchen maid in our own kitchens.
' 'You can't marry her.
' Said his parents.
'You, a young lord, marry a kitchen wench.
'He stopped eating.
He stopped drinking.
He took to his bed, very sick.
All the doctors were sent for.
No one could cure him.
And then someone said, 'that girl, what was she called.
Catskin.
Um, get her to, to make a dish.
Perhaps, well then, he'll eat it.
' And so it was done.
She'd now learnt to cook.
And she made him the best dish she could find, and took it up to him.
And he ate a little.
And on the next day, a little more.
And a little more.
'Til he was well again.
And his parents relented, and they were married.
Now that might have been the end of the story.
But, well, they had a young son.
And one day, when the boy was about four, and was playing in the courtyard with a beggar's child.
The old cook.
The nasty old cook.
She saw them and said, 'well, i can see why those two play together.
Two beggar's children.
' And now Catskin knew that she must say who she was in truth.
At first her husband couldn't believe that a father could treat his daughter like that.
But she said it was true.
'Right, we must go and visit him,' said the young lord.
And Catskin didn't want to go.
But, he persuaded her.
And they got a coach, and rode back to where she'd been a child.
And she wouldn't come in.
But the young man went in, and said to the nobleman, 'are you the father of a kind girl, who left here about five years ago.
'Oh, yes, i didn't realise what a wonderful girl she was, 'til she was dead, and my poor wife has died of grief.
But, i did so want a son.
' 'A son like me.
' 'Yes a son like you.
' 'Come with me.
' And the young man took the old man, out to the carriage.
And said, 'here is your daughter again.
Here is a young grandson, who can be raised up for your estates.
And i will be, as a son to you.
' And so, they all lived happily, we hope."
"I work as a volunteer, for a national charity, taking disabled people on holiday.
So far i've been on four holidays abroad.
I've been to Portugal twice.
Been to Rhodes, and to Austria.
It's a wide range of age groups, um, from eighteen up to about seventy.
With all different uh, people from abilities, and from all over the country.
It's usually a really good atmosphere.
And we get together and do trips during the days.
And then go out in the evenings.
And, on the trip, there's usually eight volunteers, and the courier who organises the trip.
And a nurse, in case there's any problems_ people need, uh, medical help.
We usually stay in a four- or five-star hotel.
Which is quite nice.
And, uh, all the trips are included.
So it's usually a really good atmosphere.
So that's something that i really enjoy doing, and hopefully do one later in the year."
"Okay, i will start with some_ a few things i dislike.
So, i li_ i dislike hot weather because, it's_ makes me ill most of the time.
I mean i've been, to hot countries such as Morocco, or Turkey, even South Africa.
Uh, each time, uh, i was sick and i could not eat for a few days.
And, oh, i mean i wouldn't do that again.
Haha.
And, um, i dislike, people who don't, listen to other people.
They just, get_ they don't communicate very... They're just there for themselves.
And, it's not about selfishness, because selfishness is, is also positive.
Um, you have to be selfish sometimes.
Um, i like nature.
I like being outside.
I mean whe- when i go on holiday i always go hiking or_ yeah.
I, i don't like staying inside and watching T-V for hours and hours.
I like sometimes watching a film, a nice film in the afternoon and the evening, with friends and_ but, i mean, yeah, it's_ i like being active i don't like being laz_ well sometimes i am lazy.
But, i'm not the sort of person that would who would lie on the beach for hours and_ yeah.
I- in the hot sun.
Uh, [ouf], i hate that.
I prefer being active, for quite a while, and then resting in the nice evening.
For instance, in winter i would go, uh, skiing, or you know, just walking i- in the  snow, and then, being back home, having dinner.
And, obviously in front of a nice_ at the fireside.
And, you know, um, i like_ i absolutely love being bare feet.
I, i think it stems from my time in Africa.
Uh, when i was in Africa, i- i couldn't bare having, um, shoes on.
I really_ i had to bare feet.
And, when i came back to Europe it was very_ really hard to, ha-ha, to have to wear shoes.
So now sometimes i'll go into the garden.
Whenever i can i, i am bare feet really.
Ha-ha.
And that's about it i think."
"So if you want to study at university in Switzerland, you can choose between many faculties.
First, you can choose medicine, and then you have, psychology.
Then you have, um,  scien_ i don't know how you call it, i don't know.
For, politics.
Um, social sciences i think you call it.
And, then you have, um, literature i think you call it.
I don't know, it's not really literature.
It, it includes geography, history, and all sorts of languages.
And, that's what i've chosen.
But, actually, when you choose this one, you have to choose three subjects.
And, one of, one of these three, uh, ha- has to be the main one.
And, this is_ this will be your main subject and you, you will do an exam.
Um, so i've chosen history, to be my main subject.
Then English.
And i've chosen to combine these two subjects with another one in, another faculty, which is social sciences.
So, i've chosen to study sociology.
And that's one of the possibilities, they have, to combine two faculties.
So, i have three subjects on the whole.
It's not like in England, when you can combine whatever.
It's just_ yeah, it's all mixed up.
You can choose, uh, well of course if you study medicine, y- you don't study anything else.
It's enough.
You have enough work with medicine.
But, um, it's not so_ you're not so free to choose whatever you want.
Whereas in England i think_ and it's longer, i think.
So, for me it will be at least four years, if i succeed.
Ha-ha.
So that, we'll see.
And the reason why i've chosen this_ these subjects is because i'm interested in, in, in them, mainly.
And, i, i, don't have an idea what, what it it will lead me to.
But, i just do it because i enjoy it.
And i'll_ and i need something, solid.
Something i can hold to, um, because now i've been getting around quite a bit, learning something, more structured.
Uh, just to, to get to_ like a frame or_ uh, like, yeah, a structure.
Uh, so i'm quite looking forward to it.
Because, uh, it_ i'll been in, friendly environment i hope.
Ha-ha.
People of my age and, uh, with the same interests.
Well, generally the same interests.
And, i imagine, um, i'll do a lot of activities.
And work a lot of course.
Ha-ha.
Although the, the first year is said to be, a f- a year where y_ where you adapt yourself.
You get to know how it works at university.
And, y- you realise if it's really want to study or not.
And many change, change direction."
"I'm a student at a small college, um, in Oxford University.
And, uh, i'm living in college, this year.
So i get up at about, eight o'clock.
Um, and i go downstairs and i'll have, have breakfast in our, in our kitchen.
Um, along with about, i think a- a- about twenty twenty-five other people.
So it's quite lively at breakfast.
And, after that i, i go upstairs and have a shower.
By this time it's about nine o'clock.
And some days i have, i have lectures.
Although not too many, luckily.
And, if i have a lecture i am_ it's about fifteen minute walk away.
So i go to that for, for probably an hour.
Perhaps two hours.
Um, then i come back.
And if i've got to get some books from the library, i can go and do that_ that doesn't take too long.
Um, come back, perhaps do a bit of reading before lunch.
We have lunch at about, one o'clock, with everybody.
It's quite nice.
And then after lunch, sometimes, um, i'll be going off to do, um, a rehearsal, with a band, that i'm in.
So, uh, i can take my guitar, and amplifier along to that.
And then in the evening perhaps try and do some more work before dinner.
Which again we have, we have altogether.
Sometimes we can bring guests to dinner.
Uh, and then after dinner i've got the whole evening.
So perhaps you'd go to the pub with, uh, with some friends.
Or go and see a film.
I like to go and see some films.
We've got, uh, three or four cinemas in Oxford.
So, we- we're quite lucky.
Got a good choice of cinemas.
Um, and then after that, perhaps if i'm, if i'm feeling quite hardworking, i can go back and do some more work.
If i've got to go and have a_ have a lesson the next day.
Um, and then into bed at a fairly healthy time.
At about midnight_ something_ roughly.
And, uh, that's about it, for an average day."
"Um, i think, in everyday life, the, the most important, like, and dislike, because i think the two go together.
Is, people that you don't know, when you're walking along, the street.
Um, because you know i- i- i- it only takes a few seconds, as you're going past someone.
To look at them.
Um, because you can make a_ you can ma- make an opinion on what you think that person might be like.
Just from walking past.
So i think it is important that, if, if you're walking past someone.
I- if there's even, a crease of a_ a crease of a smile, or a friendly look on someone's face.
Even though you know you're not going to stop and talk to them.
It's very nice to have that.
Whereas i think, a lot in Oxford when i'm walking along, um, it tends to be_ if i go past someone.
A- and you make brief eye-contact with someone.
You tend to me- to meet a frown.
They look, uh, a bit suspicious of you.
Which i think is a shame.
Because i- i think life would be a lot easier if people would just make a little bit of a smile now and again."
"It might have been that i would have married a missionary, at my church.
That does tend to happen to a lot of members.
But, instead i've ha_ actually married a person who doesn't, officially stand as a member of my church.
He's very welcome to come, and he's highly delighted that people make him welcome every time he does pop along.
He does wonder_ the services can be a bit long.
But he's very patient, and he sits with me, and i direct him towards what's being spoken.
And the idea that it is quite crucial to pay good attention.
People have made an effort to develop their talks for Sundays.
And one day i'm going to be asked and he's going to be expected to help me out.
Because, i will be asking him.
Hmm.
So, there's, times that he enjoys coming, when he does choose to come with me.
We've also had our wedding at the church, of course.
Which was quite an i- opening event, for our relationship.
Because, we got to know our mutual friends more on that day.
Lots of people came.
Lots of_ the family members that we have were inspired by the church, and how welcoming people were.
They didn't miss the tea.
They thought they might miss tea, on, on, such a day.
But they were happy to drink the very nice fruit juice that was prepared.
They_ as members of the Church, that were there, were pleased to meet our family too.
And have since made them very welcome when they've, popped along to events.
One event that should be coming up this month, is the talent night.
Which my husband is quite expected to come along to.
Because, everyone realises that he's got a very good sense of humour, and he's quite into stand-up comedy.
He will write quizzes as well.
One of which is being held at the church, and people thoroughly enjoy the evening.
And we raise money for Comic Relief into the bargain.
They do tend to look for him, to make them laugh.
S- church isn't always very serious at all.
But he's_ he can certainly bring light elements to, the meetings.
Something that we have yet to decide on, of course, is whether or not our family_ our children, might be members one day.
That will be very interesting.
We don't particularly have views either way at the moment.
But i like to think that we will bring them up in a spiritual manner.
And my husband has no real objections to that being, the case.
He worships within his own four walls, as he puts it.
Those of his head.
And, um, he also studied theology at school, and he was a member of the Christian Union, like myself.
So, going to church, having a dear faith is not totally alien to him.
And we hope that we can encourage our friends, and our family around us, to be en- encouraged by our example.
And to, maybe think twice next time, missionaries pop round to them, whether or not um, they do stand to gain something from what's said.
And whether or not they, they certainly make them welcome.
Because one day, who knows, their family, several generations removed even, might just happen to have joined, and be able to tell them about how much they enjoy it as well."
"Cock fighting’s a popular sport in Asia.
Although i lived in Indonesia for twelve years i never actually saw one there, because it’s technically illegal in Indonesia.
And they do a pretty good job of hiding it from the tourists, haha, although it still goes on.
There’s no doubt about that.
But, um, yo_ the first time i saw one was in the Philippines.
'Cuz i was going there just on a, quick holiday.
And, uh, the gov_ it’s legal to have cock fights in the Philippines and the government even, uh, sponsors huge cock fighting rings.
And i went to one of these things, in, um, the island of Mindanao.
It’s, it’s a really big thing.
It’s almost a, it’s like a very small stadium, around.
And, uh, the cock_ actual ring is, uh, covered with perspex, like a, a, glass, a see through material.
So, the cocks can’t run away, but you can still see them perfectly well.
And they have their little spurs on their feet.
Which they attach at the last minute, after they’ve got their_ the cocks really good and angry.
By, uh, nipping at theirs bums, and beating them about the head.
And then they’ll put them in the ring, show them the other bird, and even hold, the oth_ hold_ before they put the spurs on they left the different birds get a kick in at the other one, by holding one down.
So, by the time they let them go the birds are really, really angry.
And, to, uh, to knife one of the others with the spur, the cock has to be higher up than the other one.
And so they’re both trying to get higher up, by flapping their wings and pressing into the other one.
So they end up just rising together, up to about maybe four or five feet in the air.
Just a, a ball of flapping and spurs and feathers.
It’s really spectacular.
And then one of them will, will fall down.
And, hehe, and they’ll take it away.
Each round, doesn’t last more than about thirty seconds.
It’s really quick and a lot of money changes hands, around the stadium there.
I won a hundred pesos on my first cock.
But then i lost it all."
" Coincidences well, as far as i'm concerned, it's more about_ i don't know what to call it.
Maybe, intuition.
And_ well, it's connected with my, my half-sister.
But until last, summer, i did not know, that she existed.
And, although i did not know, i sort of knew.
Haha.
Because, first, she is_ she was born on the fourteenth of March.
And my aunt, was born on the seventeenth of March.
And i always thought my aunt was born on the fourteenth of March.
So, i mixed them together.
I don't know if, if it's all about intuition or not.
But, some people say it might be.
Some- some- something i felt, i don't know.
Don't know if it's true.
I mean, might be numbers you know, in your, in your head.
And, the second thing about my sis_ my half-sister is that, i sort of knew, i sort of felt it.
Just before, uh, we, we all, um, discovered that she existed.
Well, my, my, father, um, bro_ broke the news to us.
Um, first he, um... Uh, i just can't remember what i'm going to say, hehe.
Uh... Yes.
When, when we were about to discover it.
It_ we were very tense in the family.
I don't know, if we all felt something.
Which is_ was, one of the most tense moments, we had in the family.
And, a few weeks before, i just told my father, 'well, you have a secret.
' I just said it like that.
I don't why.
I don't know_ it came out like that.
And, uh, and afterwards i didn't, i didn't even remember that i'd_ that i'd said so.
And once my father came to me in my room and said, 'you know, you_ you told me once that i had a secret.
Were you thinking of anything is- in particular.
' And i said, 'no.
Did i say that.
I can't remember.
' And i even, didn't think that he was worried about it.
And i didn't even think that h_ he must have, one secret, at that moment, when it was, most obvious.
Ha-ha.
And then i realised, what was going on, and i discovered it all.
But everybody in the family said, i_ i was, somebody quite intuitive.
Who could feel things, and_ well i suppose it happened."
"Uh, since coming back from, travelling where_ um, I was eating rather... Odd things like, um, lots of boring things.
And, um, I've taken up a passion for cooking.
Um, I've... I love cooking and, um, tend to cook a lot with coriander and limes, and fish.
Um, and I've sort of taken over my dad's kitchen, and started making my own pasta and bread.
And, I don't quite know what's happened.
But, um, haha, maybe I'm growing old too quickly.
But now I love it, and, um, i, i, I tend to sort of cook wi_ quite healthily with lots of olive oil.
And, um, fresh herbs.
But, um... I never thought i, I'd be a good cook.
But it's quite nice to hear lots of people say, uh, say that, um, uh, a very tasty meal, all sorts of compliments.
So that's my new_ latest passion I've taken up."
"Well although food is not, uh, such an i- interesting topic.
For me I have a few things to say.
Because now that i, i_ well, I've been renting a room for, a few months now, in Oxford.
So, I had to cook for myself, of course.
Food, and shopping and everything.
And at first it's quite_ it, it's quite nice, because you, you can cook whatever you want.
And its it's,  qu_  it's also  cre- a creative thing.
You, you put some bits and pieces in there to_ really create a meal you don'-, you don't, buy ready-made meals or something.
I_ I'm not like that.
I, I like creating and, uh, I like putting lots of, herbs and garlic and onions.
And, I like spicy food.
Not too spicy because then you, you cannot taste anything any more.
But, uh... Well it's quite different.
Uh, at first I chose to, to buy things that I di_ I did not used to, to eat at home.
Like lentils, or, you know, chickpeas, or even vegetables that you don't, get in Switzerland.
For instance, like parsnips, or, uh, yeah whatever.
Uh, I love vegetables, very much.
I love fish that I've found.
Um, the... Uh, the bread is awful.
It's absolutely_ it's terrible.
I'm reall_ I'm really looking forward to go to back to Switzerland for that because, th- the bread in Switzerland is gorgeous, compared to here.
It's just, it's just insipid, I mean_ and it's so... Chewy, and it's not crispy.
Uh, I mean if you buy French, well French breads, they're all_ they only have the, the white one, and it, it's taste- tasteless.
I mean... So, I hoped t- to do my own bread.
But then, haha, it, it would take me too long I think.
But, uh, usually at home I do my own gradually, we've g_ well we have a machine so, you don't really do it.
You put the ingredients in, you can put whatever you want in it, and, have nice bread, and it smells nice.
Yeah.
And, um, I've got a friend who_ is in Oxford now, and he is_ um, he likes um, doing vegetable juice.
So, he puts lots of vegetables_ yeah, but I've never tasted it though.
But, he invited me to go and have, a taste of it sometime.
Um, you can put some nuts in it, and you mix it together.
Ah, i- I'd love that I think.
Yeah.
I really would love that.    "
"So the first year that I moved to the U-S i, lived in the... Uh, common dorm that there is, uh, um, a dining table and common... Kitchen, where everyone, uh, used to went and ate cooked food.
So we didn't have to bother.
But in the next year, I and my friend decided to move, over to an apartment.
And... And, we were really confident we're going to do a good job, in, uh, cooking Indian food and... And even invite others for eating it.
But very soon we found out that that's not the case.
Uh, it was really hard for us to cook, uh, food up to, our mothers' cooking standards.
But I think in Indian food, uh, for non-Indians maybe just, uh, when you add some curry and add some spices, uh, it just, uh, becomes Indian.
But, uh, those who are really used to that food may find that, difficult to eat, so,  we just kept the food we cooked to ourselves.
And, um, whenever we meet these days, we really don't discuss those, haha, days of our cooking."
"England is full of interesting stately homes.
And Oxford has its fair share of interesting houses, in the near vicinity.
Uh, uh, just over a week ago i went to visit Coughton Park which is, um, the other side of Stratford-on-Avon, which isn’t too far away.
And, um, i hadn’t been there before.
And i found it a fascinating place.
It was built in the fifteen-thirties.
And belonged to the Throckmorton family.
Who were, a recusant Catholic family.
And, there was, um, an old church.
And a priest’s hide-a-hole.
In fact i think there were about_ i think there were two or three priest hide-a-holes there.
But they also had, a number of interesting letters and archives from all sorts of kings and queens.
Dating actually back from even before the fifteen-thirties when they actually built that particular house, on the site of the land that had, um, been given to them.
Um, going back to even some of the Plantagenet Kings.
Various charters and letters that had been written to them.
Cause they had always been courtiers.
. .  At the courts of the various monarchs.
And, um, particularly interesting correspondence during, the reigns of the Tudors.
One of the, um, Throckmortons was a very close go-between between Queen Elizabeth I, and Mary Queen of Scots.
Who has always been a great heroine of mine.
Ever since i was a child.
I think she’s one of the most fascinating women in history.
In fact, both queens are.
I think they’re two of the most fascinating.
And one of the most fascinating things about them is perhaps that they never met.
Um, although various playwrights, and writers have tried to speculate on what would have happened if they had.
Um, and they have there, actually, which i hadn’t been aware of before.
Because i thought i had seen, most places which had any memorabilia of Mary Queen of Scots.
But they had, um, the chemise she wore at her execution.
And also her death mask.
And, 'cause Mary Queen of Scots was actually in fact very tall.
Not people are very aware of this.
And she was abou- about five foot eleven.
She was nearly six foot.
Um, which in those days, for... A woman was extremely tall.
Even for a man it would have been extremely tall.
In fact it’s one of the reasons why the unfortunate, um, romance between herself and Lord Darnley took place.
Because he was he was the only tall male around.
Hehe.
The only one who could look her in the eye.
Hehe.
As opposed to the chest or below.
Hehe.
And, uh, she loved dancing and so therefore they were more or less, of an equal height to dance.
Anyway, um, i’d never actually seen the this_ the chemise wa- was really interesting because it looked_ really you could tell.
I stood beside it, and you could tell, you know that, it only_ i was sort of several inches beneath it 'cause i’m, um, about five foot five.
And you could tell that it had obviously belonged to a very tall woman.
And, um, and the death mask was interesting as well because her face was quite full there.
Whereas usually, um, portraits and pictures show a much leaner, angular.
And of course, she would have been, a, a middle-aged woman then.
Which, in fact, at the time really c- would have been considered quite old.
Um, so that was very interesting to see that and quite fascinating.
Um, in fact, actually the only pictures they have_ they don’t unfortunately have a postcard or a picture of the death mask.
But they have got a picture of the chemise.
And it’s actual fact, on the same postcard where they have an alb, uh, which is a vestment.
Um, sorry not an alb, a cope.
One of the vestments worn by, uh, one of the priests that used to say mass there.
In fact actually this, um, particular alb, um, i will keep saying alb_ cope, had been, um, embroidered by Queen Catherine of Aragon.
Who was Henry VIII's first wife.
And the, the chemise is in between that, and also a coat.
A hunting coat that belonged to, um, one of the Throckmortons in the eighteenth century.
And both the coat and the vestment are really quite short.
And then you’ve got this very tall chemise.
Hehe, lo- long chemise.
Um.
When i say tall because the, um, models that they’ve fi- dress- dressed them on.
Um, it looks quite extraordinary because Mary Queen of Scots’ chemise is head and shoulders, you can say, above the two, um, men’s, uh, coat and the, the vestment.
So, um, it was as i say it was actually fascinating seeing that.
And there were beautiful gardens and grounds.
And they had all these plants and herbs that they grew there.
And they also sold them.
So i was able to, bring a few unusual herbs home.
Um, to, make additions to my herb garden on my roof terrace."
"I first danced when i was about four years old.
And, um, i was_ i took to it very well.
I was, um, a natural dancer.
But as i was so young i, i missed my mom.
And, um, i couldn't_ i couldn't, continue it any longer.
I mean i gave up.
And then i cont_ and then i started again when i was about fourteen years old.
And i won, lots of awards and things like that.
Um, but again i gave up after, a few years.
Now that i'm twenty-five, um, i'm going to take it up as a hobby.
So, i'm looking to, start an evening class, in dance.
Um, possibly contemporary dance.
Um, 'cos i just love the sort of freedom and the movements, and, the music and, i, i wish_ it's kind of a regret.
But i wish i'd, never stopped dancing."
"I live in a house with three other people.
It's a big old house on the corner of Spring Street, and Vandiventer, which means it's in a neighborhood with other old, beautiful old houses.
But it's only one block from town.
So it's like living in town at the same time.
We have a nice big porch out front that's nice to sit on in a summer.
One of my roommates Crystal, she is about thirty-years-old, she's interesting.
She actually went through Princeton Seminary, which is an unusual thing for a woman.
She's working at an athletic department of the university now, so she's not... Really using her, degree.
But... I like living with her cuz she's a calm person, and very patient.
And she likes to_ she likes the same kind of things that i like, so we have a good... Groove together.
Our other roommate Chris, is a young man and he's, a little bit off track, in his life.
He drinks too much.
He drinks every night, beer, wine.
Not just a little bit like normal drinking, but more than somebody his age should.
So, we're a little bit worried about him.
He could be really interesting if it weren't for that.
He likes to go kayaking and hiking and, he has a good job, and he is a good looking guy.
But its a little bit_ concerns us that he does this.
He never has girlfriends, and he's scared of girls and stuff, and he just drinks all the time.
So that's him.
And then, we have another roommate who we don't see much.
And she 's from the midwest.
And she's a typical midwestern type of girl.
She has, blond permed hair, not a natural blond either.
And she is very i- into athletics and things.
And she seems funny to us cuz she actually makes jello.
And cooks like eggs and meat and stuff like real, mid- midwestern Americana type of things that she does.
So she is engaged to be married now.
She is going to be married in a few months, yet she still doesn't come home every night.
So we don't really hehe know what's going on with that.
So those are the three people that i live with."
"Hi my name's Colleen.
And this year for my class trip, we went to Walt Disney World in Florida.
It's, uh, composed of, of a couple different parks.
Um, the first one that has been there for pretty much forever is the Magic Kingdom.
Um, it's filled with rides and, shows with traditional Disney characters, like Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and Goofy and Donald Duck.
Um, they also have another park, it's called Epcot.
And that displays the country of the wo- countries of the world.
Um, each_ when you go to each country, they have a restaurant with, food from that country and the traditional setting.
And, um, they put on shows, and give like kind of tour rides, uh, showing you different things about the country.
Everybody that works in that, country, uh, is natively from there and, also speaks whatever language is from that country.
Um, they also have M-G-M, which is a park that shows you_ um, they show films about how the movies are made, here in America.
And, um, they also have a lot of three D rides that make you feel like you are actually in the movie.
Um, that's a lot of fun.
Um, and they new_ they also just built, um, what they call the Animal Kingdom.
It's a, its a safari ride through a park that is set up like a jungle.
And they have, um, all different animals from Africa, with elephants and, giraffes and, antelope and all kinds of things like that.
So it's a lot of fun.
Um, we had a really good time while we were there.
And you should try to visit it sometime."
"Okay one of the great things about, California which singles... That state out, over everybody, and especially southern California is its diversity.
You have this huge, Mexican influence in California.
And it can be seen everywhere.
In the houses, and the way the stucco's designed and everything_ as soon as you go there, you know you are in California.
And, the street names.
Uh, i dare anybody to find street name doesn't have_ that is in English rather than Spanish.
Everything is in Spanish over there.
And... Part of it's just because, um, Mexico is so close, and there are so many immigrants in that area, that they've influenced California so greatly.
And i'm sure part of it has to do that, California was once a part of Mexico.
California is a Mexican word.
And_ or a Spanish word.
And, um... Not only, is, is a Mexican culture prevalent there, but the Asian culture is.
You have a lot of Chinese and Japanese and Korean, all coming to California because it's the closest place to Asia.
And it's, it's really interesting because, um, in a lot of places there, there is no exposure beyond Caucasians.
But in California there's everybody."
"Um, a lot of the people i know, i, i know they’re dyslexic from_ it’s, it’s almost a very characteristic thing.
It’s, uh, i look on it as, as quite a nice thing to_ it’s almost an advantage.
And, um, um, you can_ i can almost_ now 'cause i’ve been taught a lot about it.
I’ve got a dyslexic, uh, tutor who would just tell me, no end of stuff about, about the, um, the condition, if you want to call it that.
And i, i just sort of_ supposedly out of_ there are seventy-five different kinds of dyslexia that are known.
Yeah.
And, and, most people who are dyslexic don’t even know it.
So, we take all our information from people who we know are dyslexic.
But i know so many people, who just get away with it.
Because it, it can be an advantage.
It can be taken as an advantage.
I’ve got a really good friend, who i know for a fact is dyslexic.
Like left, right, and centre he’s completely crazy.
He goes off on one all the time.
Somehow he did no revision and managed to get loads of As and Bs in his exams.
And his G-C-S-Es.
Um, and it can, like, it can_ people look down on it.
And i can’t, can’t understand why.
I mean i suppose maybe they just don’t, haven’t been told about it non-stop like i have.
Like... Basically, um, Cheryl’s just sort of, completely, sliced it all up and gone right, 'this is this.
This is this.
This is how your brain work.
This is, uh, why it works that way.
This is why you have dyslexia.
This is how it affects you.
This is what goes wrong with your writing.
This is why you rea- if you if you’re reading a book, and you get_ you misread a word, you, you don’t notice you’ve misread it.
But your brain will scatter 'cause your brain knows that it’s got the word wrong.
And you, sort of skip over lines or words and get confused, and then you have to go back.
'But it’s, it’s not too much of a problem really.
I mean you can_ basically the second_ if you’ve made a mistake, you will notice it and, generally you can sort it out if you’ve been trained to be able to deal with this problem.
And it’s just like if you spell a word wrong, like, like proportion.
You just go back to the root word.
Which is what, the, the, smallest version of that word.
Um, and then you just sort of build it up.
It’s really easy.
Um, and i_ if it’s_ it’s, it’s quite good because i’ve sort of been, been going to Cheryl for, a couple of years, a year and a half or something.
And she will just tell you those little bits and bobs.
Lil_ little bits about Latin.
I mean i can’t speak Latin or read it or anything.
But i know the little bits of it now.
And it’s, it just like_ it comes in useful.
It'd to tell you little bits about words like_ 'cause you have to explain how to spell a word.
So, you have to explain why the word is there.
Why these letters are joined together.
Why, the word is in sections.
In, in phonic sections.
Um, like you’ll get sort of all these, all these swear words.
And, and she’ll tell me, 'right.
All these swear words, the reason why they’re offensive,' 'cause i always wondered this when i was little kid.
Why is a certain word offensive.
.  It’s just a word.
And she said 'well.
'  One day she, she explained it to me that, 'because England has been invaded, so many times, uh, in the early half of, of the century.
Um, and so the Vikings they bring a language, a style of a language which is, short, to the point, sharp words, okay.
Um, and these words... Are different.
There’s different ways of saying things.
'Now you say it in a Latin way, they’re long words.
They’re beautifully pronounced.
They’re... They’re wavy and that and they, they're nice.
You can even_ if, if you walk the street shouting Latin swear words no one would do anything.
If you walk the street shouting Viking swear words, everyone would be quite offended.
Just because of the sound of the word.
Um, and you’ll get like, a four letter word in Viking and it’s like fif- a ten letter word in like_ in Latin.
And it’s_ and the kids.
The mothers, your mother would, uh, hit you around the head if you were talking Viking.
But not if you were talking Latin.
Because it’s the educated language for the time.
&Quot; but, anyway i’ve strayed from the point.
Basically like you_ if, if you are dyslexic you can’t look on it in a bad way.
'Cause you can use it as such an advantage.
The left side of your brain is bigger than your right side.
You know this to be true.
So use everything that you know that you can use.
And, all the strengths that the left side of your brain gives you, use them.
Take advantage of them.
I mean like it’s com_ you can get extra time in exams.
You can get free special one-to-one tuition.
You can get everything if you’re dyslexic.
The world is totally your oyster.
I mean there are like_ if you are dyslexic you’re lucky that you’re not, that you haven’t got the same problem except with your ears.
' Cause like my dad’s got the same problem with his ears.
He, um, your wi_ you will mishear things instead of miswriting them.
So like you’ve just gotta, you’ve just gotta grasp it.
Do you know what i mean.
And you’ve gotta use it for all it’s worth.
If someone gives you jip for it then, i mean find out about it and jip 'em back.
Because you’ve got like,  you’ve got it on your side."
"I'll tell you a story about Easter and an experience i had around the time of Easter.
So Easter is a Christian holiday and it takes place sometime in the spring.
And in America, i don't know if this is true in other countries, but in America, Easter has become associated with rabbits.
And uh, rabbits hide candy and eggs.
And children go find the candy and eggs.
So children really like the Easter bunny because they get all this... Candy and these eggs.
So, i had a job one Easter and i dressed up as a very large rabbit.
I dressed up as the Easter bunny, and i was in a shopping mall, and i would sit in my Easter bunny chair and children would come up to to me and they would get to have their photo taken, with me.
That is they would get to have a photo taken with, the Easter bunny.
And, um, so i had this very interesting job.
And at the same time, i was writing music with some friends, and we had a band, and we were able to have a performance at our high school.
So we scheduled the performance and we planned some, interesting things for the audience to entertain them besides the music.
So one of the things i thought was that i could take this little_ this box that i had from work.
And this box held small toy rabbits, little toy Easter bunnies, which children like so much.
And i thought “oh i can take this box of small toy rabbits, of toy Easter bunnies.
I can take it to the concert and then while we are playing we can, uh, throw them out into the crowd and so, the crowd can have an even better time than just listening to the music.
So at the appropriate song, what ever it was, however we decided what song, we had someone begin throwing these little Easter bunnies out into the audience.
And the crowd really loved it, hahm.
They, they must have had such good memories from their childhood o,f the candy, and the toy eggs, and the, toy rabbits.
And everyone just went crazy and made so much noise and were cheering and were trying to get hands on these rabbits, while we're playing our music.
However, they made so much noise, so much cheering and shouting, that the drummer of our band couldn't even hear us playing the music.
We couldn't hear our own music.
And we completely lost time, due to the fact of the crowd making so much noise.
Not because of our music, but because of Easter bunnies, of little toys, being thrown into them.
And, uh, it was a complete disaster, or so we thought.
And we didn't know where we were in the song, we didn't know what we're doing, who was meant to be playing what, or singing what.
And somehow we got through.
But uh, it was very amusing um, experience.
Maybe it's more amusing, to be able to tell the story of how the song was completely, ruined because of the toy Easter bunnies."
"I'm Ebony Tucker, Ebony Laticia Tucker.
I'm eighteen years old.
I'm a Scorpio.
I was born November nineteenth, nineteen seventy-nine.
And i think i should've been born earlier.
I i was_ i came out of my mother's womb and, she told me i was green.
And... Um... She said, uh, because i was green, that she thought i would be like an old, old girl like a- old lady.
That's what she called me an old lady.
So, um, i was, i was quite old.
I was beyond my years.
And when my younger, my younger sister was born, i sort of took over the mommy like role, with her.
And i took care of her for a while.
Um, i have like two sisters, and two brothers.
One's deceased, my oldest_ my older brother.
My oldest brother is twenty-five, my oldest sister is twenty-one, and my younger sister is fifteen.
The girls are three years apart.
Um... I get along with my younger sister great.
I love her to death.
My oldest sister, unfortunately, does not like me.
And i don't know why.
My mom is, wonderful.
She is crazy just like i am.
And i love it.
But, um, she was crazy in bad way too.
So we had some hard times when i was growing up.
Um.
I lo- i go to school.
I go to College of New Jersey.
And i'm majoring in elementary education, and psychology.
It's wonderful.
I love it so far.
I love being in school.
I love being on my own.
I love, working and being busy.
Um, i have plenty of goals that i want to accomplish.
And i have a plan that, you know, i could follow, but might not go the right way, yaknow.
Um, i'm in love haha.
But we won't talk about that now.
Um, in school, i'm also in the army reserves, i'm in R-O-T-C which is reserved officer training corps.
And, i use them for money, basically.
Um, i mean, the discipline also and to get my body in shape.
Um.
I like fitness and, i want to be in shape and, um, that is definitely helpful hah.
Um, i also_ i am, i'm also in a group called leadership development program.
And i'm a facilitator.
And we give workshops about, how to run meetings, and how to deal with stress in school.
And, um how to... Run like your staff meeting and how to have something go well for you.
How to, um, just plan things and be organized.
It's a wonderful group and... And i'm glad i'm in it huhu.
I'm also in the black students union, which is pretty good.
Um yeah, we build parties, we have leadership conferences.
We, just have fun, i guess, and we do a lot for, um, the minority camp- on campus.
Um, right now, i live in a new residence hall on campus.
And i'm happy because it has air conditioning.
And i'm not dying, um, of heat exhaustion like i did over the summer.
Because my house unfortunately was really really hot.
And my mum's fan broke and then my mum stole my fan.
And my sister had my fan from school.
So i had no fan.
And it was rough, it was very rough.
Over the summer, this past summer, i, um_ my best friend, or my really good friend from Ireland came to visit me.
And,it was great like, um, i found out that he was really in love with me.
And, i mean i loved him before.
But... But, you know, i didn't know how much i did.
But, but the time he came, i was seeing someone across the street from me.
And he was staying in my room, like, he slept in the bed that was next to mine.
Well, you know, on the other side of the room.
And, it wasn't like a big deal or anything.
But the guy i was seeing was very jealous.
And he wasn't even really my boyfriend.
But i was just seeing him like, a little bit seriously, i guess.
And, um, i ended up just losing or wasting three weeks of my, time with a terrible jerk guy who was across the street.
And i had a wonderful, wonderful guy who loved me truly, in my home.
And_ but it worked out for the best anyway, cuz, i dumped the guy across the street.
And... Um, Paul, the guy from Ireland, came back for a, a day, before he, uh, flew to Kentucky to see his brother.
Um, well... That was about the end of that summer.
And i got my first car.
Yes, i got my first car.
That was a highlight of the summer.
And i had a wonderful, wonderful baby-sitting job that i had two lovely kids um the Kraals, Sally and Duncan.
And, it was just wonderful.
It_ the kids were just funny and fun, and... Um, they paid me very well .
Two hundred and fifty dollars a week.
And my_ before i had my car, they gave_ they lent me their car, their old car.
Uh, left me money for the kids.
And it was wonderful.
And i went to go buy my car, and i found the perfect car.
My favorite color's blue, and i got a blue car.
It 's four doors.
It's not too small, it's not too big.
And it runs pretty well.
And i only paid... One thousand four hundred and ninety-five dollars for it.
And... It had eighty-five thousand miles.
So_"
"I love school.
I... You know, i couldn't live without going to school.
I can't imagine living without going to school.
Um, since elementary school, i love my teachers, i love going everyday and, playing outside, playing sports.
Once middle school came, i loved it.
Um, i didn't have too many fun times in middle school.
But i still loved it anyway cuz i was learning so much, and... Um, experiencing so much with people.
And high school, my freshman year was the best because i was involved in sports.
And i was good at them.
Now sophomore year, i had to stop, playing sports or running track.
And i started working.
But then it opened up a whole little_ a whole new section of my life to me.
And i met a lot of people, who actually got, got me where i am today, or helped me get to where i am today.
Um, my senior year, i just got out of high school.
I was just ready to leave and i got out, ready for college.
The real thing, being o- being on my own and learning, real stuff like, in high school, you don't really learn real stuff.
You learn facts and information and stuff.
And you get a chance to study certain things that you might be interested in.
But in h- in college, you have the opportunity, to actually take a topic that you're really interested in, and look further and deeper into it, and see your own little things.
And, and... I don't know i was just really for that.
And i went to the College of New Jersey because it was close by, not too far away, they gave me the most money.
I_ that wasn't my first choice though.
My first choice was a, a small historically black school, um, called Lincoln University Pennsylvania.
And i went there.
And i fell in love with it, because the campus was beautiful, people were so nice, and they had a lot of things to do there.
Um... But i got in there, i got in.
But i didn't go because it's in Pennsylvania, and i had to fill out a total different financial aid form for that.
And i was, through with forms.
Senior year's full of forms and tests, so... I didn't want to go through that.
Now the College of New Jersey is not the best college... In the world.
It's a very good college for academics.
Soc- i mean socially and like fun-wise it's like a three.
They have some good parties because fraternity life is on campus.
And the... The fraternities are pretty cool.
They have some good parties.
But a lot of them have left Trenton, the area around the school, because there was a shooting last semester.
Um, the minority fraternities on campus are very few.
But, they are cool also.
And they give the most parties, the best parties.
And, because there is no alcohol at them.
Like they're_ parties with alcohol are good.
But they are not like the best because, people ruin it.
Because they get all messed up and they can't have fun any more.
Um, sororities now, sororities, i'd love to join one because they're on campus.
But the one i want to join is not on campus.
And they're deltas they're, are at another college.
Um, i'm in R-O-T-C.
I work as security for my residence hall and it's all fun.
I love being busy... And... I can't wait to graduate. "
"Great travel book.
Possibly, the quintessential travel book.
<Em>A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush</em>, by Eric Newby.
Almost everything that Eric Newby's written, that i've read.
Which is most of it by now.
Is... Interesting, funny... And, exciting.
But a lot of it's not very suitable for reading aloud.
He does have very long sentences, and they do get a bit tangled up.
And i was very pleased to see, when i went to hear him speak recently, that, he has difficulty reading aloud from his own work, as well.
Bless.
Ha ha.
He was a bit hampered by a very loud thunderstorm that was taking place.
Which we could hear.
But sometimes it was appropriate, to what he was reading.
So it balanced out.
Anyway, <em>The Hindu Kush</em>, is the story of, his first exploration.
This is the one that sent him, off to be a travel writer, really.
This is where he undertook this as a career.
He, starts off as a salesman, a dress salesman, um, and, this is where he is at the beginning of the book.
And it tells of his departure from the dress salesman business.
Ha ha.
To, a completely different man.
Halfway_ ah well eventually a_ all the way up, a mountain, somewhere where almost no Europeans had been, ever before.
And, there are photographs in the book, which, show this sort of dapper, podgy, little Englishman.
Um, looking unbelievably naive, and unprepared for things at the beginning.
Smiling proudly, you know, here i stand on foreign soil, type of thing.
Um, and, um, a rather, um, the worst, for many infections.
And rather, gruelling situation with inappropriate boots, for climbing.
And, uh, very weather-beaten, looking fellow, towards the end.
But still... Shining-eyed.
I was very pleased to see the photographs.
And, shows that travel can improve, as well as, wear you down.
Ha ha.
But, the book... Is, very, true and very engaging, and very sincere.
And, full of his life all around.
I think one of the reasons that he's such a particularly good travel writer.
Is that, he... He experiences each individual thing in its context, as something that is happening to him in his life.
So, what i mean by that, is, whatever happens, it isn't just, and then, and then.
It's, got a sense that, it belongs with something he's told you before, that might not have happened on this journey.
But as an aside.
Or, it will, add a layer to something that comes next.
It's almost as if it's constructed like a novel.
I'm not sure whether, he writes like that.
I'd_ i'm not sure whether any travel writers deliberately write like that.
Though i'm sure at least some do.
But, it certainly reads like that.
It's certainly got that richness of structure.
And there is of course_ it is a quest.
Because, he's going on a quest to go up this mountain.
And, um, it makes dashed good reading."
"I went to Russia, in the summer between my seventh and eighth grade.
And, i, found out a lot of things about their culture that i never had anticipated.
And, for example, uh, friendships over there are, more physical and, they have a lot of more touching contact that's comfortable.
For example, friends in America don't usually, hold hands, and, lock arms, and give hugs all the time.
It's, its more for special occasions and really personal times.
And when i went there, girls that i, talked to for three minutes, they just wanted to, walk down the road holding my hand.
And at first, i was pretty freaked out cuz i never experienced that before.
But then i realized that was just a different culture.
And just a different way, of letting somebody know that you care. "
"Now we'll take a little vacation.
I_ one spot i like, is Canada.
When you leave the United States to go to Canada you have to stop at the border.
And they examine your car,  and check to make sure you don't have nothing like cigarette contrabands and... Liquor and things like that.
And then once you get into Canada you have to change your currency.
Because our money now is not worth much.
But their money at one time used to be worth less than ours.
And they would always give you a few cents more than what your dollar was.
The town of... Montreal is a lot of French.
And we went out to look for a place to eat.
And to speak to these people.
Ha, it's very fi- hard to find someone that'll tra- translate English for you, or speak English.
This man had sent us to this cafeteria style restaurant.
And... The guys in the back that were cooks they would just sort of slop the food on your plates, you know, instead of putting it nice and neat and proportioned.
And there was holes in the concrete floor.
But i enjoyed Canada.
The Niagara Falls is very nice.
Their countrysides are very nice.
And the Queen's Highway is beautiful.
It's very clean.
It's not litter all over, like there is in the United States.
I had gone to... Texas one time.
And i guarantee you if you don't like heat you do not want to go to Texas.
It was like a hundred and thirteen one day in the shade.
And if you stop along the roadside_ we used to stop for lunches on the roadside.
And the gnats_ the sand gnats, they bite you all over.
And Florida.
I used to go to Florida and i enjoyed my trips to Florida.
Because i loved to go to the Seminole Indian village.
I_ their equipment and their houses_ once a year they go off, and hunt wild game and things and come back.
And the women and the old men and the children are only ones left in the village.
I watched the alligator wrestler.
And a lot of people in the United States don't realize, but the Seminole Indian village people is the only tribe that has never signed a peace treaty with the white man.
And, they live more or less on, wooden platforms, and they, they do everything as_ all the rooms are on this one platform.
But it's a nice educational... Vacation to take to learn about different tribes,and different... Groups in the United States.
I like to learn as much as possible because i do have a little bit of Indian heritage in me.
And i'm very proud of it.
So let's see_ but i think my favorite vacation place and my final retirement place, is going to be Martha's Vineyard.
It's like a different world there.
Everything is so clean, and... Out of my vacation spots that's my favorite."
"The first time i ever went skiing, i was about eight years old.
And my parents didn't want to ski, and my brother didn't want to ski.
I just wanted to ski.
So, they signed me up for ski school.
And, i went on the mountain and i thought it was going to be really easy, and it was the hardest thing in my life.
I had two big sticks coming out of my legs and, i didn't know how to get up, i didn't know how to get down.
I was slipping all over the place.
Just the bunny, the bunny slope which is the easiest hill on the mountain, i fell down five times... The first time.
And my instructor would wait for me, and then i'd get up and fall down again, and my skis would fall off, and i'd have to put back them on again.
But you couldn't put them on wrong, you had to put them on right.
And it was_ these huge boots, and it was this big production.
And then the second time i went down, i only fell down once.
And that was very cool... Uh, i was really getting into it, and so i wanted to go faster and faster.
And i was speeding down this hill, really really fast.
And, my, my teacher was yelling &quot;slow down, slow down.
&Quot; but i thought she was just saying down.
So i ducked even lower and i went even faster.
And i ran right into a sign, it was a ski school sign, ironically.
And hahaha that was my first day of skiing."
"I like reading books about climbing.
And a lot of people in my family climb.
But i can't stand heights.
Especially not big draughty heights.
Like you get on the side of a mountain.
What i like is depths.
I like caving, because, you have the same climbing thrill.
But you can't see how far down it is.
Much better.
And there's no wind whistling past you either.
So you feel, kind of, warm, and dark, and safe.
And it's like being a little animal going down into your burrow.
You just feel safe underground.
Well i do.
I like wet caves better than dry caves.
Dry caves are all very well.
But, after a while you just, feel like a mole.
Whereas wet caves, it's like another world.
Wet caves are, certainly in my experience, are bigger, and more dramatic.
There's a lot more to look at.
Little muddy passages, are little muddy passages in the end.
But, the kind of holes that are carved out, by water.
Just, you can go through little tight squeezes.
And come out into just, enormous caverns.
That, you know, almost nobody's been in before.
I mean, a lot_ you know few people do.
Few people are prepared t- to crawl around, in the dark, in their spare time, for two hours, further and further underground.
So you know that you're in a special place.
Very pleasant.
The first time i went, i was quite nervous.
My friend had got me into it.
And then when the day came, she couldn't come.
So it was me, and two old guys who ran the local caving society.
And, we went off for the weekend to go caving, together.
And they took me down a very easy cave to start with.
Which was... Uh, almost like a dent in the hillside really.
You could just see daylight, even from the cavern at the bottom.
But it gave me a feeling of what it was like, to concentrate on not thinking about the enormous lump of rock over your head.
And how it might just decide to fall down, that particular moment.
Because i did that one quite well, i think.
As in, i didn't have a screaming, claustrophobic attack at them.
Which no doubt they're always expecting as a possibility with a first time caver.
They decided that they would, next go down a cave that, they like to go down.
This cave was on the far side of a river.
That you had to wade across.
The entrance was on the river bank.
And the river was going down the entrance, already.
So, it was_ yo_ you can only see half of the entrance.
It was crawling, face down.
And the water is coming up, running up past you, going down quicker than you are.
Nice cold water through the wet suit.
So you're always cold.
I couldn't bottle out at this stage.
Because you can't go backwards.
It was at a_ about a forty-five degree angle, downwards.
With the water coming too.
And it was, about, twelve feet, with, uh, approximately a right angle bend every, four feet.
And then you came out onto a, a steep passageway.
Um, which just dropped, and you could climb rapidly down, and then it was very tall and thin, and everything was fine.
At that point i could have turned round, and gone back out.
But by then i was hooked.
Because i knew that, the tight space, is only a doorway, extended.
And so you don't need to be afraid.
There's noth_ it's, it's... That's how i saved myself from the fear of being trapped.
Was that i could experience it as just a doorway.
Something you walk through from one big space, to another big space.
And so, i thought &quot;wow, right, this is fine.
I can cope with this, this is marvellous.
&Quot; it was very tall and thin.
And the sides of the cave, were, waving in and out, depending on where the water had been, that.
Because, obviously the water level changed, a lot, um as the, the height of the river rose and fell.
And, we sometimes had to take off our helmets.
And sometimes we had to bob under the water, to avoid places where the walls got very narrow.
Too narrow for your head to go through.
And then we came out into an enormous, wide, open cavern.
We carried on through, small and wide spaces, for a while.
And then, my two guides, agreed that they were lost.
And, they hadn't actually been down this cave, for, ooh, about a decade.
And they couldn't remember how it went.
So, they left me sitting on a rock.
While they went off in different directions.
And i sat under the ground, listening to water pouring in.
Trying to persuade myself that it wasn't going to fill up.
The only light, the light coming from my, helmet.
The, the lamp on my hard hat.
While they went off in different directions, to try and find the way out.
Needless to say, they did find the way out.
And i discovered that i'm not actually brave enough.
No matter how curious i am to hide the light, and to see what it would feel like, to sit there in absolute pitch darkness."
"My husband always wanted to fly a plane.
So once, for Father's Day my, two daughters and i... Made an arrangement, for, lessons, with a local teacher, flying teacher.
And, um, i told them, i says, &quot;now i can always get a new husband, but you can't get a new father&quot; hahaha.
And so they said, &quot;well maybe we'd better not give him those lessons&quot; but we did and he learned to fly and, he bought his own plane.
And in fact we had two of them.
And, um, the last one he had was_ well it was the equivalent of a twin engine plane.
But it had a single engine put out by Cessna.
It's their largest single engine plane.
I even remember the, numbers November six two one one bravo.
And it would go_ it could go as, as, say three thousand miles at a shot, and without having to stop for gas.
But then people can't go that long.
So we would, uh, fly, uh, just so far, like from, California to Phoenix for instance.
And have lunch and, uh, get, um, um, oxygen in the plane and, then fly on to maybe St Louis and spend the night.
And, um, the next day stop at, um, Lexington maybe for lunch.
And then, that night we would be in Princeton to visit our daughter.
So it was always great traveling across country in the that plane.
We had, um, property in Arkansas and we would fly there occasionally to check on it.
And that was always very interesting landing there.
Because the first time we tried it, the landing strip was between a lake and a mountain.
And the, uh, windsock was all worn out, so we couldn't see what way the wind was blowing except by looking at the waves on the lake haha.
So that was entertaining trying to land in that little dangerous spot.
But, um, Arkansas is interesting that way hehe.
But some of the most enjoyable times were spent, uh, flying down into Mexico.
We would take, um, my daughters and my_ maybe a sister and her husband or something.
And go down to  Wymas or Puerto Vallarta and, uh, enjoy the Mexican food and, uh, beach activities.
The food is just wonderful down there when you get away from the border.
And, um, my daughter and i still laugh to this day about their quaint way of, labeling things on their menus.
We saw on one, um, sweet potatoes and we thought &quot;oh great.
That's that's those candied yams, those wonderful sweet potatoes that we have&quot;.
It turned out to be Irish potatoes that they had peeled and put sugar on.
So that was sweet potatoes to them.
And of course the girls enjoyed para-sailing and disco and one thing and another, but it was, uh, a lot of fun.
And of course sometimes it could be quite harrowing.
I know, on one trip back we came into a storm... And at San Bernardino.
And, um, uh, somehow we got caught up in snow and that was before my husband got his instrument, license so we were trapped and we didn't know how to get out of there because we had the mountains between us and home.
And we had to call on Edwards Air Force Base to get us over the mountains hahaha.
Like, they could see us on their radar and could, uh, track us to see that we got over the mountains all right.
So, little things like that made it entertaining.
And then once the, uh,landing gear light came on saying that it wasn't working.
And um_ so i had to pilot the plane while my husband pumped, this old pump that would put the wheels down.
And, um, that way you don't know if the wheels are down really cuz you can't see under there.
And we were coming home, and it was a Sunday night and no one was at the airport.
So we couldn't fly by the tower to see_ let someone see if the wheels were down.
So we really had to kind of chance it to land.
So we didn't know if we were going to land on wheels or the bottom of the airplane haha.
So there were interesting moments like that.
That_ how did my husband put it, &quot;you spend thousands and thousands of hours, with just boring ordinary flying, punctuated by moments of sheer terror, hahaha.
But, uh, we always made it haha.
Sometimes i thought we weren't going to, but it was fun."
"There was once a widow woman who had one son Jack.
Oh, he was the laziest sort of man you've ever come across.
Now, when he was boy she didn't mind looking after him.
That was a mother does.
But now he was growing up it was time he got a job and contributed something to the household.
But he just sat around.
She didn't know what to do to make him get a job.
And then she thought, no work... No porridge.
In other words she wouldn't feed him, unless, he got a job.
Now the first work that Jack got, he was paid in coins.
And he put them in his hand.
And his way home took him over a stream, and as he jumped over the stream, the coins fell out.
So he went home with nothing.
'Oh, you foolish boy said Jack's mother.
You should have put them under your hat.
' 'I'll do that next time,' said Jack.
Well the next place he worked was on a farm where they made fine butter, and cream, and cheese.
And for his pains they gave him some butter.
And he remembered what his mother had said.
And he put it under his hat.
Well you could imagine what it was like when he got home.
The butter was in his hair, and it was running down his face.
So again he'd come home with nothing.
'Oh, you foolish boy,' said Jack's mother.
'You should have wrapped it in leaves and carried it on your hand.
' 'I'll do that next time,' said Jack.
Well the next place that he worked they had a cat who was a fine ratter.
And they gave him one of the kittens for all his work.
And he remembered what his mother had said, and he started to wrap it in leaves.
Well, like any self-respecting cat, it jumped off and ran away.
So again he went home with nothing.
'Oh, you foolish boy,' said his mother.
'You should have put string around it's neck, and pulled it along behind you.
' 'I'll do that next time,' said Jack.
Well, the next place he worked it was a butcher.
And for all his work he was given a leg of lamb.
And he remembered what his mother had said, and he put string around it, and he pulled it along through all the mud and muck.
With all the dogs in the place running after.
When he got it home it wasn't fit to eat.
'Oh, you foolish boy,' said his mother.
'You should have put it on your shoulder.
' 'I'll do that next time,' said Jack.
When he went to work for a herdsman who had animals of all sorts.
And for his work he was given a little donkey.
And he remembered what his mother had said, and he started to put it on his shoulders.
And there were arms ev_ everywhere, and legs everywhere, and mud everywhere, hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haws everywhere.
Oh, you've never seen such a sight.
Now it so happened that Jack's way home that night, took him past the farm of a very rich man.
A man who had a daughter, who never laughed, and never smiled.
And her father had said if anyone could make her laugh, or smile, they could marry her.
Well, she was looking out her window that day.
And she saw Jack coming with the arms everywhere, and the legs everywhere, and the mud everywhere, and hee-haw, hee-haws everywhere.
And all the small boys of the place running after cheering.
And she laughed, and she laughed, and she laughed.
Her father had never heard such a noise, and he came running.
When he saw what was happening, he looked out of the window and he saw Jack.
And he beckoned Jack to him, and said, 'Jack you're not married are you.
' 'No.
' 'Then you can marry my daughter.
' 'Oh, i'll have to ask my mother,' said Jack.
Showing the first piece of common sense he'd ever shown.
Well when he went home his mother didn't say, 'oh, you foolish boy,' that day.
She just said if you're going to live with that rich man, then so am i.
And so they did.
Happily, we may suppose."
"Um, i’m also really into stories.
I think, all humans, it’s a natural trait.
It’s been going on for a long time.
Um, i mean this is like a tribal thing, do you know what i mean.
There’s like one bloke within a tribe who tells the entire tribe like, all these crazy stories.
Keeps them active.
It’s, it’s been entertainment for thousands of years.
And, um, i really like films and stories.
But especially books.
Because a book, there’s something about it.
You conjure your own visual images from a book.
It’s not like a film where, you get, bombarded left right and centre by images and, clever little things that_ well supposedly clever little things.
A book is, is intricate.
It’s big.
You can reread a book, uh, more times than you can re-watch a film.
That’s what i generally find myself.
Especially creative writers, um, like James Joyce, or Franz Kafka.
And they can they can make these stories that are, that are unbelievable.
But they can make them, incredibly interesting and incredibly, involving and enthralling.
They can_ take for instance, um, <em>Metamorphosis</em> by Franz Kafka.
The beginning page starts, with a human who wakes up one day and he’s on his back.
And he realises that he’s been changed into a giant bug.
Like a cockroach.
A giant cockroach.
Now that doesn’t sound like a very good intro to a book to me.
But this is one of the greatest stories i’ve ever read in my life.
Um, somehow he, he manages to link it with, feeling.
And he makes it believable.
That is a strange thing.
It is believable this.
Because the family are so, the family is, so close to, to this Gregor, before he turns into a bug.
Um, and, and somehow i- it, it keeps it there.
And, his life is, is told in such a realistic way.
And, these incidents where he’s nearly caught, they’re so believable.
The entire thing is.
Uh, and there’s loads of moral issues as well, that he goes through.
This guilt trip.
And, and you would really, wouldn’t you.
If you were, if you were the support for your family and then suddenly your family was supporting you even though you couldn’t.
And they didn’t know how to do it, because you had given them everything they wanted.
And now, they had to give you everything you wanted.
But you look like a giant bug.
And, and there’s loads of issues like, what if, what if it was reversed.
What if the situation, was reversed.
What would, what would my actions towards my family be, if it was the other way around.
And he, and he thinks, and he thinks, and he thinks.
And he's trying to_ he’s constantly trying to get round a problems, that he can’t solve.
And it’s, it’s a beautiful story.
He ends up dying... I believe.
Starving.
I can’t really remember.
Um, it was such a long time ago.
And i’ve lost the book.
It’s been robbed of me.
It’s in Kuwait.
Yes.
When (Telall) comes back from Kuwait, soon he will give it me."
"Hi, let me tell you about one of my favorite books.
It's <em>1984</em> by George Orwell.
It was written in the early fifties, as... A prediction as to what the world would be like if the co- government continued to take more and more control... Over the aspects of our lives, the public.
Um... It describes a world where... The government employs, anyone that's considered a citizen.
And, where, you cannot do anything without the government knowing about it.
The government only gave you the information that they thought you should have.
They rationed all your food, and all your drinks, and everything.
Um, people are deprived of, things we take for granted now.
Um... And, if they try to work around the government, the government just, had them killed.
Not_ but not before torturing them ridiculously.
Um... I think it's a good book because, it opens people's eyes.
It's often taught in high school here.
Um, and it makes people question authority.
It makes them... Be grateful for what they have.
And it um... It really makes people think about, what could actually happen.
And uh... I don't know, i think, i think it's definitely a good book for everyone to read, because... It really makes you think about, uh, about the world we live in."
"I went deaf for a couple of weeks.
It was very odd.
There was_ it was overnight.
And it was both ears.
It got better, i'll tell you that now.
Ha ha.
So that was okay.
But, of course, when it had happened, and i was still deaf a couple of days later.
And, went to the doctor.
And they couldn't make it go away.
I thought i might have to cope with this for the whole of the rest of my life.
I could wait, for two weeks, until they finished all the procedures they could do.
And, just put my life on hold, panicking and wondering what was going to happen.
Or, i could just, go with it.
And say, 'okay, let's either play at this, or, learn straight off.
' And, decided to go for it.
And i read lots of books on being deaf.
And i thought_ and i joined mailing lists of being deaf.
And, i sort of, decided to do the 'what's it like to be deaf' thing.
And make an adventure of it, rather than going, 'oh, woe is me.
I can't hear a thing anyone says.
' 'Cos that was quite annoying.
And i didn't realise, until i got my hearing back.
How much i enjoyed being deaf.
I wouldn't go deaf again, on purpose, i mean it's just too convenient to be able to hear.
And it makes it a lot safer crossing the road.
And i do like to natter to my friends on the phone.
Though there are, of course, things you can use, that i found about out.
Like text-type, and typing phones, and stuff.
But... It's, a privacy that you have, when you're deaf.
Because, people can't shout your name.
Even if you don't turn round.
When you can hear someone shout your name, you want to turn round, even if you make a decision not to.
It's like it perks you up.
It distracts you, and it disrupts your train of thought.
And for those two weeks, while i was deaf, nobody distracted my train of thought.
Nobody.
Nothing, distracted my train of thought, except another train of my own thought, interrupting it.
I could watch telly, i could read books, i could have conversations with my boyfriend, when he had to shout at me.
But_ so they were kind of hard work.
But, it was all my initiation.
And that's a very... Comforting feeling.
Makes you feel very stable, and sure of who you are.
And... I missed it, when it was gone.
I can see why people, can object to having hearing thrust upon them.
Cochlear implants, and things like that.
And why old people turn their hearing aids off.
I can see.
Because, that, impenetrable silence, is, very reassuring, and very soothing.
And you get used to it.
Boy, do you get used to it.
And you miss it when it's gone.
Course, it's much worse when you've got, raw, can-hear-again ears.
And everyone thinks that they must shout at you.
And so, my reintroduction to the hearing world was particularly loud and raucous.
Haha.
And quite painful, actually.
But, um, i, i'm pleased to be able to hear again, obviously.
But, it was a interesting, couple of weeks.
For just a holiday, i'd recommend it.
Ha ha."
"There was once a king.
A king who had a most beautiful queen.
Her name was Silvertree.
And then, they had a daughter, who they called Goldtree.
When she was a child, she was pretty enough.
But as she was growing up, then she was going to be as beautiful as her mother.
If not more beautiful.
Now, usually as a girl is growing up, she and her mother can become friends.
But, sometimes, just sometimes.
A canker gets into the heart of the mother.
And she begins to resent her daughter.
Resent her youth, resent her beauty, resent all the compliments that men pay to her.
And so it was with Silvertree to her daughter Goldtree.
And as men came, talked to her, laughed with her, as they didn't to her mother.
And as young men came from foreign parts, to ask for her hand in marriage.
Oh, Silvertree, she resented it.
And one day, she walked up the long dark glen, to the pool where the trout lived.
And said, 'troutie, troutie, who's the fairest queen of all.
' 'Which is Goldtree, it's Goldtree.
'And Silvertree was so angry, that she ran down that glen, and she went to her husband the king, and she demanded the heart, and the liver of her daughter, Goldtree.
Well there was no way, that the king was going to kill, his only daughter.
And there was a young man there who wanted to marry her.
So the king called him to him.
And said, 'marry my daughter.
Take her to your land far over the seas.
'And then he went out into the woods, and he killed a goat.
And he took the heart and the liver of that goat.
And served it up to Silvertree as though it was the heart and liver of Goldtree.
And all was well, for about a year.
'Til Silvertree again went up that long dark glen.
To the pool where the trout lived.
And said, 'troutie, troutie, who's the fairest queen of all.
' 'It's Goldtree, it's Goldtree.
' 'But, Goldtree's dead.
' 'Goldtree lives over the sea.
' And then Silvertree remembered the young man who'd been there about a year before.
And this must be where Goldtree was.
So, she got a boat, and set sail for those distant lands.
And Goldtree, she saw the boat coming.
She saw from the flag, that it was her mother.
And she didn't wish to see her mother.
And her husband wasn't there to protect her.
He was out hunting.
Only the servants were there.
And she said to them, 'go and put me in that little strong room, and lock me in.
And hide the key.
Don't let anyone in.
Not even my mother.
' And they did so.
And when Silvertree came onto the shore, and went up to that place, and demanded to see Goldtree.
They said, 'she wasn't here.
' 'Her husband then.
' 'Oh, he's out hunting.
' And Silvertree wandered around, and she came to that little locked room.
And she knew her daughter must be there.
And she said, 'Goldtree.
Goldtree, it's you mother.
Open the door and let me in.
' 'I can't.
I haven't the key.
' 'Oh, Goldtree put your little finger through the lock that i might kiss it.
' And thinking no harm, Goldtree put her finger through the keyhole.
And her mother took a poisoned thorn, and stabbed her on the finger.
And Goldtree fell back as though she was dead.
And Silvertree sailed away.
When the husband came back from hunting, he heard of this strange visit.
And how his wife had asked to be locked in the room.
And he took the key, and went in.
And found her there as though she was dead.
And he picked her up, and he put her on a table.
And left her there.
And only he went to visit her.
And the body, didn't decay, as you'd expect a body to do.
But, well a man like that must have a wife.
And so he married again.
He told his second wife all about Goldtree.
And she was allowed to go wherever she liked, except into that little room.
Now, i don't know about you, but if someone tells me i can do anything except one thing.
And go anywhere but one place.
That's the place i want to go.
And so, when one day that wife found the key.
She went into the little room, and she saw the body of this beautiful woman, lying on the table.
And of course, she went closer to have a good look.
She knew it must be Goldtree.
And as she looked she saw a little mark, on the finger, and she touched it, and she pulled out the thorn.
And slowly, Goldtree, came awake.
And so it was, when the husband again returned from hunting, there was both Goldtree, and his second wife to greet him.
And oh the joy, and the hugs, and the laughter.
Well the second wife would have left.
But, they said 'no, you saved Goldtree's life.
Stay with us.
' And so she did.
And all was well.
But, meanwhile, back in that land where Goldtree had been a child.
Her mother again went up that long, dark glen, to the pool where the trout lived.
And said, 'troutie, troutie, who's the fairest queen of all.
' 'It's Goldtree, it's Goldtree.
' ;It can't be, Goldtree's dead.
' ;Goldtree, lives over the sea.
' And so she took ship again, and sailed.
And when Goldtree saw her coming, she would have hidden again.
But the second wife said, 'no, we'll face this together.
' And they went down to the shore to greet Silvertree.
And Silvertree came, and landed.
And she had with her, a little flask, a little bottle.
In which said was fine wine, for a gift for her daughter.
But the second wife said, 'it is the custom in this land, if anyone brings anything to drink, or to eat.
They must have the first of it.
' And she made Silvertree pour out some of that wine.
And drink it.
And the evil Silvertree, fell dead on the ground.
And Goldtree, and her husband, and second wife, lived happily as we all may."
"I'd like to talk very briefly, about manners and courtesy.
Which are two things that i think are very important to this world.
But that people don't pay enough attention to.
If we all just treated everybody else, they way we'd like to be treated ourselves.
Think what a better place it could be.
Just, having somebody hold a door open for you.
Saying 'thank you' if you hold the door open for them.
And smiling at you as you pass them in the street.
It would just make everyone_ everything seems so much more, sunny and happy in life.
Just remember that other people have problems.
And that your problems, are probably not as, desperate as the others.
Try to be happy.
And pass the happiness onto other people through, your politeness.
Remember to say, please and thank you whenever you can.
'Cos, when people do that, they seem to be so much, nicer people to know.
And i feel, people like that are the sort of people i want as my friends.
If you see somebody in trouble... Go their aid, and help them.
It can't hurt you.
It will make you feel better afterwards.
I think if we all did something like that, we'd feel better about ourselves.
And when we feel better about ourselves, we can deal with our own problems better.
Which in turn make us feel better about ourselves again.
Um... Courtesy doesn't cost anybody anything.
It makes, people's lives so much more pleasant.
And just a, a trip into town, when you've got to go and buy some milk, i- is just made into a much better experience, if people around you, are happy and polite."
"Heritage Weekend, is a European event, whereby buildings that aren't normally accessible to the public_ aren't normally opened up to them, are available to see, for one weekend.
It is a, a weekend that i thoroughly look forward to, all year round in fact, and i'm keen to tell people about it.
Maybe to the extent that they weary of me, but it is a lovely occasion.
And i intend to go for many years to come, each year.
First of all, you're able to visit those places, that are open locally in your own town or city.
Those that we have seen have been a local observatory, with a globe on the top of it, that has, um, signs from the zodiac, positioned all around it.
And the figure of Atlas holding up the globe, indeed.
Ltthe views are wonderful, from the top of the observatory, even though you have to climb a very narrow, steep stairway to get to them.
You are able to open the window, place your camera outside, and chance your arm with how wonderful the view's going to be in your picture.
Another place that we're able to see was that of an architect's practice.
He had converted a slaughterhouse, into an office for himself.
And he'd done some very nice projects on houses locally.
He was also able to tell us about the Landmark Trust.
Which is a group of people that enable you to stay in unusual buildings.
One of them was a building that looks like a pineapple, from the outside.
It has a turret with a window that is decorated with stone, that is carved in the shape of a pineapple.
Maybe we'll be able to stay there.
It probably will cost us quite a bit to do so, but who knows.
Another place that we're able to see, was the following weekend, when London opens up all its houses that aren't normally open.
One of those was the Courtauld Institute, which has some crypts down below.
And a complete walkway that you're able to travel round, and gain a feeling of what London was like in Dickensian times for example.
I think that's an embid_ abiding memory, that will stay with me.
Especially when i enjoy watching costume dramas on television, and i can really get a sense of the, times that were had there, in amidst all the smoke, and, the worries of how hard life was."
"In my life, and at church, i hope that i'm following Christ by befriending people that i come to know.
Whether it be at work, or whether at church, or in the community.
If i could focus on when i'm at church, people who come, new, each week might not know what time we start, what time we finish, how long the meetings are for.
And what's done in the meetings.
So i can give them an idea, and of the events that we'll be doing later on in the month, or the year, as well.
To encourage them that there are lots of things to look forward to.
Each month something that we do, is to go and visit, the fellow members that we have in the church.
We will go together, as a partnership, myself and another lady at church.
The idea is to make sure that, sisters, as they are called, are safe in their homes.
They're feeling stable in their lives.
And that if they've got any things that we can possibly do for them, we can set about doing those.
We hope, that they look forward to our visit.
And we certainly always gain from seeing them.
At the church on a Sunday, i'm probably going to help in the nursery as well.
Lots of weeks we might find that, somebody hasn't been able to turn up.
So you go in at the last minute, and you thoroughly enjoy it.
Time passes by, ever so quickly, and you've exhausted yourself, and the children have still got lots of energy to run around.
The library is something that i'm... There to take care of each week.
I've got to arrive by nine-thirty.
And if people want things for the lessons that they're going to hold, hopefully, i've dug out some pictures for them, and some points of reference that they can use.
I've taught a class myself, so i know that it's important to have visual aids to try and keep the children's attention.
I knew that i wanted to join the church.
I knew that i certainly wanted to go to church.
But, this church in particular, i find has a lot of practical bases to it.
And very dear family values, which i share.
So, i never want to impose my views on people, but i just want them to possibly see the example that i hope i lead.
And think about applying some spirual- spirituality into their lives, so that they will gain.
If they choose not to, that's certainly their prerogative.
But, u- i tend to think, that there are lots of things that i've gained from_ by joining the church.
And i hope there's lots of things that i have to look to in the future.
Developing my character more.
Meeting, yet, more and more people, and doing more and more of things."
"Now, i suppose, all of you know, the sound that a lion makes.
If you live in Africa, you might know only too well.
And hear that roar echo, across the grasslands.
If you live elsewhere, you've probably read, plenty of stories about the lion.
Well, this is an African story, about how the lion got his roar.
Because, they say, once upon a time, in the olden days, the lion was silent.
And he crept through those long grasses on the savanna.
And then, suddenly, with a rush, he pounced on his victim.
And the poor creatures, never knew, where he was.
So well camouflaged, was he, by the long tall, golden grass.
And they certainly, couldn't hear him.
As he never made a sound.
Well, the animals decided that something had to be done.
And they called a meeting, without the lion of course.
And they discussed, and they thought, and they puzzled, and they wondered.
How on earth_ why on earth did the lion not make any noise, when all of the rest of them, made some sort of noise.
They yapped, or they squeaked, or they yowled, or they twit-tweeted, or something, anyway.
And, at last, the hare, the hare said, 'i've got an idea.
' 'Huh, you, little hare.
Well, you can run fast, so if you get into trouble, then certainly you can be out of danger, quite quickly.
All right.
What's the idea.
' 'I'm not going to tell you.
Let's see if it works.
'Well, the animals shrugged their shoulders, and thought, nothing attempted, nothing done.
So, the next day, oh, what a day it was.
The sun was beating down, it was so hot.
And it had been a long hot, dry, summer, and all the water holes had dried up.
The river beds were sandy.
There was hardly a trickle anywhere.
And the animals were, very, very, thirsty.
Well the hare, he ran along.
And he hid behind a big prickly bush.
Because he daren't, he daren't risk this lion pouncing on him.
But he could see the lion, lying on his side, and panting away.
And he called out to the lion.
'Lion,' he said, 'lion, are you thirsty.
' 'Wha- huh, wha- who's there.
Oh, hare, yeah, of course i'm thirsty.
Do you know where any water is.
' 'Well, a- a- as a matter of fact i do.
' Said hare.
'Oh, do you.
Can you tell me where it is.
' 'Oh, well, better still, and because it's su_ a long way away, lion, i could take you there.
But, it's awfully long.
We'll have to go very fast lion.
' 'Oh, oh, oh well let me stretch a bit.
All right, when do we set off.
' 'Right now.
' Said hare.
[Whooshing noise] and all you could see in the distance, was this ball of dust.
Well, poor old lion.
He got up, and he started running, [lion panting] he was soon very out of breath, i can tell you.
'Hey, hare wait for me, wait for me.
' 'Come on,' said hare.
'Come on, you've got to run faster than this, if you want to get to the water hole.
' [Lion panting] 'all right, all right, all right,' said the lion.
[Lion panting] and he ran on, and on, and on, and on.
And the sun rose up, high in the sky, and still there was the hare, chasing up, and over the rocky outcrops.
Down into the valleys.
Along the dried, river beds.
Through the tall grasslands, on, and on, and on.
And every now and again, poor old lion, shouting out to hare, 'hare, hare, wait for me, wait for me.
I can't run as fast as you.
' 'But, you'll never get there,' said hare.
'We need to be at the water hole, before -fore the evening, when all the animals reach there.
Come on lion, come on.
' [Lion panting] and off he raced.
Well, on and on, and on they went.
And by mid-afternoon that poor old lion_ he was padding up that last, rocky outcrop, and at last they got to the top.
And he just stopped, and said to hare, 'hare,' he said.
'I can't go on any longer.
' 'Oh, look it's just down in the valley there.
' 'No, no, no, not another step.
I've just got to, i've just got to, uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh ohhhh.
' [Snoring sound] and yes, our friend the lion was fast asleep.
And as you may guess, that's exactly what hare wanted.
The hare,had stopped, underneath... A giant honey locust tree.
All prickles.
Long spiky prickles sticking out from this honey locust tree.
But hanging, on one of these prickles, was a large bag of sweet smelling, sticky honey.
'Mmm,' thought hare.
'Just what i wanted.
' And he stood underneath this bag of honey.
And with a great leap, up he reached.
And with his hands caught the bag of honey, and pulled it down.
And then he sneaked over to the lion, who was lying, dead to the world.
And he took that honey, and he smeared it all over lion's mane, and all down his back, and all down his legs, and in-between his toes.
And lion, i suppose, in his dreams thinking that somebody was giving him a very nice massage, rolled over onto his back, with a yawn.
But he never woke up.
And hare smeared that honey all over his tummy.
And then, all around his cheeks, and in his nose, and up his nostrils, and round his eyes.
Until he was completely smeared with that sweet smelling sticky honey.
And then he hopped away.
And hid, behind the tree.
And soon, as evening began to fall, yes [bees buzzing] back came that great swarm, of bees.
And they got to the tree, and, 'zzz.
Where's our honey gone.
Zzz, who's stolen our honey.
Zzzzz.
There's the culprit.
' And they descended on poor lion, in a swarm.
And they bit him, and they stung him.
They stung him on his nose, on his nostrils, on his head, in-between his toes.
In-between his fingers, on his claws, on his backside, on his front side.
They stung him all over.
And poor lion woke with a start, and he started to swat out with his front paws, and kick out with his hind legs.
And... 'Ow, oh, ow, oh, ow, oo, uh, uh.
' And suddenly, he was racing across, and down the rocky outcrop, and he let out the most enormous rrrrroarrrr... And that roar echoed across the grasslands, and down the valleys, and over the mountains, and all the animals heard that roar.
And they knew that hare had tricked lion.
And now, they would always know when lion roared, and his echo, echo, echoed, over the land.
That they_ might have a chance of escaping down that burrow, or up that tree, or into the river.
And that, they say, is how the lion got his roar."
"One thing I enjoy doing is cooking.
Mainly because I like eating.
But I do actually enjoy the cooking to begin with.
The best part is when I'm at home, and I can cook for my family.
Because it means I can cook a really big meal.
And hopefully they it enjoy it at the end of it.
I find it quite difficult since starting university.
Because, I'm only cooking for myself.
So, it needs to be made in small- smaller quantities.
But, uh, sometimes we share meals, a- at my house, we're living at.
So it is easier, to cook for three or four.
When I'm cooking, I tend to experiment, rather than follow a recipe.
I just sort of, bung anything in, and use up leftovers.
Which is quite fun, 'coz you never know quite, what it's going to taste like, or, what it's going to end up like.
Probably my favourite part of cooking, is making puddings, and desserts.
'Coz, I've got a really sweet tooth, and I'm a bit of a greedy pig, sometimes.
But, uh, unfortunately, l- nobody else in my family, has a sweet tooth.
So it means I have to eat it all by myself.
But, uh, in general, I really enjoy cooking."
"Well, when i come t- to talk about what i think, or what i like and i dislike about England.
I automatically compare with Switzerland of course, because that's the place where i live.
So, at first when i, um, i came to England, one thing that, really struck me was, how to_ um, the way you get information from people when have to phone, i don't know, a swimming pool or even at the school, at the office when you want some information, you cannot get it.
E- for instance i wanted to know, when was the next exam.
So, i asked the secretary of the office, and she couldn't tell me.
She said, 'there's one person in the, the whole school who knows.
' Hehe.
Um, but she couldn't tell me, where to get the information from.
But, she couldn't tell me_ well give me the information.
She could not.
I was amazed.
I mean, if there is a place where you, you can know that it's, uh, in the office.
They could not.
And, there's a saying when you have to phone the train station or, ahem, i don't know what_ the swimming pool or whatever, they can- they can't give you the information.
They just give you another phone number.
And, you end up with, with ten phone numbers and so on, hehe.
It's so difficult.
I mean in Switzerland you get it like that and_ yeah.
It's_ maybe it's because, well, i thought the education, all the, yeah, how qualified people are.
For this i reall_ it- it made, it's_ it made it very difficult for me, hehe.
And_ but i like how people, um, are sociable.
They meet and, you can see, uh, several uh, leaflets or ads, for people to meet.
I don't think you see that so much in Switzerland.
I don't know how effective it is, i've never been to these meet_ and well, not so much to these meetings.
A few times its_ they meet in the pub there.
There're are several_ uh, later they may go for a walk.
For instance they, uh, they- they have these, um, groups where, anybody can go to.
They can, uh, go for a walk around Oxford, every Saturday, or something like that.
They can go, cycling together, and anybody is welcome.
And that's- that's quite nice i think.
Yeah, i think they are quite sociable, English people.
Um... Um, and... What i disliked also was the, the means of transport.
Ha-ha.
It's not really, organized.
I mean Oxford is_ you have several companies_ and, far too many buses.
Too many companies.
And um, it's open.
But, um, i mean any bus company can... Um, the_ there c- can be any bus company.
Any bus company who wants to come to, to Oxford can come.
But, uh, it's like_ it's (xx), i mean... It should be more organised and united.
Like, the, the train.
There should be trains going to Scotland.
And, uh, i mean, all these several companies they should be united and it would be much, much simpler, faster to travel.
Maybe, it's because it's_ why it's not so, so big England.
I mean Switzerland is of course smaller, but England is not as big as the United States of course.
But, um, yeah it should be more united i think.
Um, i can't think of anything else about Britain.
I think that, um, i would realise, better, when i go back home.
You know, you need a, a bit of time afterwards, to, to realise, how it really was."
"Some years ago i visited Israel to spend a month there teaching, English.
One on one actually, tutoring English.
Um, i was all excited about going, and i enjoyed the trip.
But i was sure i would feel comfortable there because these are my people.
No matter where you are in the world it, it_ Jews are all over.
And my children who had been there, told me that i should expect culture shock.
There would be a difference.
And i pooh, poohed it.
And I laughed at that.
And sure enough there was culture shock.
They have a whole different concept.
The, the Israeli Jew is, is almost not Jewish, as compared to the other Jews in the world.
And the reason for that, i think, is that they, became Israeli Jews because of, Hitler's war.
These are the people that had no place else to go, and these are the people who originally founded and settled Israel.
It was fi- Israel was finally given to the Jews from Britain.
And, uh, we had a homeland.
That was the important thing.
And i paid a lot of attention to helping that new Israeli state begin.
But, um, when i got there, i did not fit in.
I wasn't comfortable.
It was_ first of all you can't speak Jewish [Yiddish] there, it's almost against the law.
You have to speak Hebrew, because they don't all understand English.
And i, have trouble with Hebrew.
I learned it but i don't use it.
So i had no way of u- and the Hebrew that i leaned is Biblical Hebrew.
They have a very different Hebrew, where a lot of the words are... Uh, pronounced differently.
Spelled a little differently.
And it's a whole new ball game.
So that didn't work too well.
There was one example.
They have what they call a cheroot.
It looks like a taxi, but it's really a bus.
And they jam five or six people in, as many as they can.
They'll pick you up where you got picked up, take you where you want to go.
And fare is supposedly less.
Well one day i went into a cheroot to go some place and, um, i gave him a five dollar bill in Israeli money.
And it cost less than a dollar for the ride.
And all i got back was some change.
And it wasn't much change, and i couldn't understand.
Had_ that i got enough money.
I wanted to make sure that i wasn't cheated.
Because, of_ countries have a tendency of cheating tourists.
And so i kept asking and he kept saying, &quot;don't worry, don't worry.
&Quot; now the woman sitting next to me leaned over and said to me in Jewish, &quot;do you understand Jewish.
&Quot; and i said, &quot;yes&quot;.
And she pointed out the little coin that's smaller than our dime.
That's a dollar bill in Israel.
That's a dollar any way, it's not a bill, it's a coin.
But she had to whisper because if she_ anyone had heard her speak Jewish it would have been terrible.
You speak Hebrew in Israel, even French they'll answer.
English, if they, if they know it.
But not Jewish.
They want to have they want to have their own state language.
And it gets complicated.
There was one woman told me_ she was from America, she met, uh, uh, uh, a guy form Casablanca, a Jewish man from Morocco, from French Morocco, and they_ the way they communicate best is with Hebrew.
And they made a rule before they got married, that they'd use no other language, so that they'd have to learn Hebrew.
And they_ it's a little better now, they must have three kids by now.
But in the beginning it was difficult, but they managed.
Um we did a lot of traveling around.
I did not get to Jerusalem because it was_ July and it was too hot in Jerusalem.
But... I don't remember where i was.
Is it Baha'i.
Must have been Tel Aviv.
There's a Baha'i headquarters in Isreal, which is a different, religion from the Arabs or the Jews.
And, uh, a lot of walking.
I was at Masada.
One thing you have to know when you get to Israel, either you can walk or_ you don't go on the tours.
I was_ oh yes two, two uh, soldiers, i guess, who could been old enough to be our sons, flirted with us.
There were three of us living together in the volunteer headquarters.
And they wanted to take us to a beach party in the middle of the night.
I said, what are you going to do with me at a beach party in the middle of the night.
Well i didn't go, the other two women went.
I didn't even ask then what happened, but i'm not interested.
And then in my purse i had a card, my business card, i was looking for something, and i pulled this_ i said, &quot;look what i brought with me.
&Quot; the guy took it from me.
He said, &quot;may i have it.
&Quot; &quot;yes, sure.
&Quot; and then five minutes later, i had him showing everyone, &quot;look this American woman gave me this business card.
&Quot; he's going to visit her when he came to mish_ that story that he came up with.
Got to be very careful, you got to be very careful wherever you go.
What else is there to say.
The, the outside markets there are unusual.
Big markets, you, you wouldn't even know they were there.
Here if, if there's a flea market or something you see tables when it's empty.
They put up buildings, booths, and, and when they clear out_ they're only on Saturdays or Sundays something like tha.
, But when they clear out you'd never know that anybody was there.
They sold everything.
Even pieces of furniture.
And yet you would never know they were there."
"Uh, yeah, uh, first time i came to England was in ninety-three.
But that was for a very brief spell.
I had spent three weeks in Holland.
So i just spent five days here.
And i went back to West Africa.
And um... Well, this time around, i, i came, since September last year and, uh, i, i've been studying ever since.
And, uh, i, i must admit_ I mean, some of the things, i, i really anticipated to find here_ i thought i'd undergoing some good changes.
For example, um, where i come from in, in West Africa, uh, from a former a British Colony... We had a, a great respect for, you know, the, the British attention that is paid to to, to high standards, and to quality, in all spheres of life.
Particularly in education.
And, uh, we used to even compare and contrast British education with other... Powers in the west.
I don't even want to mention names.
Because, um, yeah, uh, we, we believed when we went to school that, uh, um, British people, had the education the hard way.
I mean they, they made sure you had, the right stuff, in the right amounts and, at the right levels.
But, um... Well obviously that has been, changing over the years.
And... Uh, even listening to people conversing and from, programs on the radio it's like, children who are going to school, now, are not having the kind of education that, we really admired, you know, in those days in West Africa.
And, uh, it's been commented that, you know ,the youngsters now, have a real big problem, with spelling, and, simple mathematics and things like that.
And, um, they are becoming more and more heavily dependent on calculators and, spell checks in computers and things like that, that, you know, they_ I mean they overlook the need to really, learn to spell properly.
So i mean_ and ,and you find this even, in, in very, um, grown up children.
And even some, some college students, they just can't spell.
And ,uh, i i'm happy that at least, uh, this been picked, up and the authorities are trying to, pay more attention to this.
For this to be improved.
And, uh, also, well_ i mean the fact that, globalisation is taking place very rapidly and, uh, with the, revolution in transport and all, that you have people from, all corners of the world coming to Britain.
And, and rightly so because, um,  the British Empire_  uh, um, Britain had, the biggest colony.
And so it's like chickens coming back to roost, from these different colonies.
And they bring with them, all sorts of things and, no doubt some of the standards have been watered down.
And, uh, in spite of, restrictive measures being put in place by the authorities i think this process will continue.
But, um, i, i have always, you know, had a lot of respect for British education... And i'm happy i came here to study in the first place."
"I came to the U-S four years ago for my studies.
Before i came to U-S my impression of, U-S was that it's a rich and very glamorous country.
There's milk and,,, honey flowing all over, and there is a lot of glitter everywhere.
But off course over the years this impression has changed as i've lived here for four years.
Surely it's not, uh, you know very glamorous or anything.
There are very normal people living here who read newspapers, just drink milk and go to work every day.
Um, maybe this impression is there, eh, because, of Hollywood and that people_ ma_ one of the main contacts for people and... What's going on in the U-S is really these movies.
And there's a lot of glamor there.
So these are really glittery even for the Americans to deal with.
And the aspect of rich i think it's really true that U-S is a very rich country, compared to the third world countries, or, India.
And one of the things that struck me as soon as i moved in was that, there's, uh, hot and, cold water taps, separate taps in every house.
I mean this is something possible, maybe even in one house in India.
Like, you have your own boiler and separator.
But, uh, doing it through public, for the public, through, you know, throughout out the whole nation is something amazing.
I mean, that sort of sums up the kind of richness that has been... Over the years accumulated in this country.
Um, i mean maybe today it just looks like richness.
But, it of course has come out because of a lot of... Effort over the years by the bureaucrats and statesmen, who made sure that this is possible whether you are rich or poor."
"Hello, my name's Jane.
I'm from Devon in the south-west of England.
I'm twenty-five years old.
I've just done one year at University.
I'm doing social work, which is of course for mature students.
You have to be twenty-one to start.
Um, eventually i'd like to work with old people.
Mainly with Alzheimer's.
I started the course a year ago.
It's a three year course altogether.
It's a degree course.
But you can qualify after two, if you do the diploma.
It's a very mixed group of people on the course.
Uh, people who want to work with children, or with disabled people.
A lot of people want to work with um, adults with learning disabilities.
But i'd personally would like to work with old people."
"It was a fine summer's day.
And Jack was out walking.
Well he was a lazy sort of fellow.
And when he saw a hare in a field, he leant against a farmer's gate, and watched.
And started dreaming, daydreaming.
He thought, if i could catch that hare, i could skin it.
And i could take the skin down to market, and sell it.
And, what would i buy with the money.
Oh, i know a pig.
And, perhaps (xx xx) in pig, and i'd have lots of little piglets.
And i could raise them up, and they'd have more pigs in their turn, so i had a great barn full of pigs.
And i could sell those, and, what would i do with the money.
I know, i could buy, my mother a house.
I did say this was a fairy story didn't i.
And, if my mother had a house.
Then i could marry.
And who would i marry.
Ah, I know, uh, a rich farmer's daughter.
And the old man would die, and he'd leave me the farm.
And we'd have sons, and they could do all the work about the house.
And i could sit back in my chair, and snap my fingers, and all'd be well.
But as he dreamt of snapping his fingers.
So he did in reality, and away ran the hare, and with it, all Jack's dreams."
"Jack was a blacksmith.
He'd been apprenticed to his father, and now he worked with him.
And it was a very hot day in summer.
Far too hot to go inside, to eat their midday meal.
So, Jack's mother brought it out to them.
And they set_ ah... And they sat, out in front of the forge.
And down the hill came a knight, in shining armor, on a beautiful white charger.
At least it should have been a beautiful white charger.
In actual fact, it was the boniest, skinniest, old nag you have ever seen.
But, the knight stopped outside the forge, dismounted, and said to the blacksmith.
'Do you have a hammer, my man.
' Well, to ask a blacksmith if he had a hammer, it was a ridiculous question.
So the blacksmith said, 'yes, i, i have many hammers.
' 'May i borrow one.
' 'Well, e- yes, of course sir.
' And so, Jack's father took, the knight into the back, of the blacksmith shop.
And the blacksmith picked off... Hammers off the wall.
And felt them, and said, 'mm, this seems a good hammer,' and walked outside.
Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack.
Before they could say anything, the knight had lifted up that heavy hammer.
And started hitting the horse.
And Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack, a- and there was blood everywhere.
And bones everywhere.
And Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack.
And then was a 'poof', and there stood, the beautiful white charger, a knight should have.
Well, Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack.
And, the knight handed the hammer back to the smith.
And said, 'mm, that was a very good hammer.
Keep it my man.
I might need it again.
' And, got on his horse and rode off.
And Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack.
And Jack's father said, 'you know that old pony of ours.
' And, Jack said, 'father you can't.
' But his father went and got that old pony.
And got the hammer.
And lifted it up.
And there was blood, and there was bones, and there was skin... And there was no flash.
All the two men could do, was to put all this horrible mess on a trestle, and take it down to the bog, and throw it in.
There was no way they could tell the neighbours, what had happened.
Well, time passed.
It was about a year.
And it was another fine, warm day.
And Jack, and his father sat outside the forge.
And down the hill, in bright shining armour, came a knight on a white charger.
And up, behind him was a beautiful lady.
At least it should have been a beautiful lady.
In actual fact, it was an ugly old crone.
Sort with a nose comes down to meet the chin.
Oh, well, she wasn't beautiful.
She couldn't help it.
But she wasn't beautiful.
But the knight stopped.
Helped the lady off.
And Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack.
And... The knight said, 'my good man, do you still have that hammer.
' 'Uh, y- yes of course sir.
' 'May i borrow it again.
' 'Uh, y- y- yes.
' Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack.
And Jack's father went in and fetched the hammer.
And handed it to the knight.
Who raised it above his head.
And Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack.
And before they could say anything, or stop the man.
The knight had lifted up that hammer, and started beating the old woman.
And there were cries, and screams, and blood everywhere, and skin everywhere.
And there was a 'poof', and there was the most beautiful woman, Jack or his father had ever seen.
And the knight handed back the hammer, to Jack's father.
Helped the lady onto the horse, and got up, and they rode away.
< /P>  and Jack looked at his father.
And his father looked at Jack.
And, Jack's father said, 'you know your mother, she's getting on a bit.
' And Jack said, 'no father you can't.
' 'If we have a beautiful young woman, i'll share her with you.
' Said Jack's father.
Well this is too much for Jack.
He went to the house, got all his clothes, and possessions into a bundle, and left home.
Well, he had to find work.
Even though he's a qualified blacksmith, it wasn't that easy to find work.
And a few days later he was sitting on a stone, possibly a milestone, and a neighbour came by, and said, 'Jack are you looking for work.
' 'Well, yes.
' 'Well, there's a proclamation, posted on the walls of the palace.
And the king's got a sore on the back of his neck.
And if anyone can cure him, they can marry the princess, and have half the kingdom.
You could always try your hand.
'Into Jack's mind came, what we'll call dung.
And of course, things like that, can cure.
But also came into Jack's mind, the thought of all the courtiers, in all their lace and velvet, collecting fresh cow pats.
And Jack made his way down to the palace.
And the palace guards weren't going to let him in.
But he said, 'it didn't say it couldn't be the likes of Jack.
' And so Jack went before the king, and bowed low, and said, 'i think i can cure your sore, your majesty.
' And the king was ready to try anything.
And so for the next few days, in all their lace and velvets, all the courtiers, and the court servants, went out with buckets, and picked up the fresh cow pats.
And anything else they could find.
And it was put as a poultice, on the kings neck.
And it worked.
In no time at all, the king was_ wound was healed.
Jack was to marry the princess.
All was set for the wedding.
The church was full.
Jack was standing at the front.
And down the aisle, came the beautiful princess.
Except, that as she got nearer, and nearer to Jack, her face turned into the face of his mother.
And there was a hand on his shoulder shaking him, saying, 'wake up Jack, wake up Jack.
' The whole thing had been a dream."
"Well, you'll all have heard of Jack.
Jack the clever man.
Jack the trickster.
But if Jack had a fault.
And, perhaps he had many.
It was the way he went on and on about his daughter Mary.
How wonderful she was.
How beautiful she was.
How clever she was.
How she'd looked after him so well, after his wife died.
And it was all right when the old king was alive.
'Cause Jack was a friend of his.
But now there was a new young king.
And he got absolutely tired, fed up, of hearing about Jo- Jack's doctor [daughter] Mary.
Can i_ i will say that bit again.
He got fed up, of hearing of Jack's daughter Mary.
One day, he called, Jack to him.
And said, 'look Jack.
If your daughter Mary is as clever as you say she is.
Then she'll be able to answer questions of mine.
If not, you are going into the deepest darkest dungeon i have.
' Well Jack didn't like the sound of that.
So he said, 'all right, what's the question.
' 'You ask you daughter, how deep is the sea.
' Well, Jack was worried at that.
He couldn't think of an answer to that.
And he couldn't see how his daughter, would know the answer to that.
So wearily, he went home.
Now, some of you will know, what it's like if a man is worried.
He's grumpy.
He won't eat his food.
He sits in the corner, in the chair.
And if you say 'what's the matter.
' 'Nothing.
' Well, Mary hadn't lived with her father, all her life, without knowing just what it ah- is like, when a man has something on his mind.
And eventually, she got out of him all about the king's challenge.
And how her father would be in a dungeon if she couldn't answer some questions.
'Oh, for heaven's sake father, what's the question.
' 'He wants to know, how deep the sea is.
' Well Mary thought.
And then Mary laughed.
'Ooh, that's easy father.
' 'It's easy.
' 'Yes, it's a stone's throw.
For if you th- throw a stone into to the sea, it gets to the bottom doesn't it.
' Well, Jack wasn't sure.
It seemed a sort of tricky sort of answer.
But then it was a tricky sort of question.
So, he went to the king the following day.
And as he went to the palace the following day.
And the king called him, and said, 'well.
Has your clever daughter got an answer for me.
''Well, yes.
She says it's a stone's throw.
' 'Why.
' 'Well, if you throw a stone into the sea, it gets to the bottom.
' And the king laughed, and said, 'that's a good enough answer.
But, i need the answer to another question.
Otherwise, into my deepest darkest dungeon, you go.
' 'All right, Your Majesty.
What's the next question.
' 'How heavy, is the moon.
' Well, Jack didn't know the answer.
And he went home, and Mary was waiting.
And said, 'well, was that the right answer.
' 'Well, yes.
But he's got another question for you.
' 'All right father, let's be having it.
' 'H- he wants to know, how heavy the moon is.
'And Mary thought and said, 'why it's, the weight, of a handful of water.
For if the moon shines on a pond, and you put your hands underneath it, you can lift up the moon.
' Well, the king seemed to have liked Mary's answers before.
Maybe this was the right answer.
So the following day, Jack went back.
And he went to the king, and said, 'Mary's got an answer.
' ';Oh, yes.
' 'She says it's the weight of a handful of water.
Because you can pick up the reflection of the moon, from a pond in your hand.
' Hehe, and the king thought, and the king laughed.
He said, 'i'm beginning to like the sound of your daughter Mary.
' And he knew of course she was beautiful.
'Tell you what Jack.
If she can do what i'm going to ask now, i'll marry her.
'Oh, Jack was so excited, and he went running home, and said, 'Mary, Mary i- if you can do what the king asks, w- then, then he's going to marry you.
' 'Why should i want to marry the king.
' Said Mary.
No one had asked her.
'Bu- bu- bu- but surely you want to marry the king.
' 'I would have liked to have been asked,' said Mary.
'Anyway tell me what i've got to do.
' 'Well, he says, he wants you to come, to him, when it's neither, night nor day.
He wants you to be, neither clothed, nor unclothed.
And neither riding, nor walking.
' Jack was beginning to think it was a bit tricky.
And, he'd been a bit upset by his daughter's answers to, the fact that, she could marry the king.
Huh, said Mary.
'Why should i want to marry the king.
' But she went to bed that night, and she thought about it.
You see, she didn't want to spend all her days, looking after her father.
And well, the king was quite a good-looking young fellow.
And, he seemed to have a mind that worked in the same way that hers did.
And he was the king.
So she got up, very, very early, before it was day.
And she went down to the seashore.
And she got some of the fisherman's net.
And she took off her clothes, and she wrapped the net round her.
So she was neither clothed, nor unclothed.
And she went and got the old billy goat out of the field.
And she walked with him 'til she came to the palace.
And then she got on his back.
But, her feet of course were on the ground.
So, she was neither, walking nor riding.
And she waited 'til it just begins to get light, before the sun, comes above, the skyline.
And she called out, 'Your Majesty.
Your Majesty i'm here.
' And he threw open the window.
And there she was.
When it was neither, night, nor day.
Neither clothed, nor unclothed.
Neither riding, nor walking.
'Ah, Mary, you've come.
' He said.
'You're prepared to marry me.
' 'Yes.
' 'And i'll marry you,' said the king, 'on one condition.
You and i are not always going to agree.
But i am the king.
Argue with me, as much as you like, in private.
But in public, i must always win.
' And Mary agreed.
But why_ whether two such strong-minded people could keep to such a bargain.
And, just how many new tea sets the royal potter had to make, well, that's another story, for another time, and another place."
"My alarm clock generally wakes me up at around 8 o'clock in the morning depending on what i've got to do that day.
I, get up, and i usually make myself a cup of tea and i have some breakfast.
And i listen to the news on the radio.
I, get dressed and have a wash, and head straight out.
I, usually go straight to work.
Sometimes i have other things to do.
Get a quick bit of shopping or something.
But, i go to work and at 10 o'clock we have tea break.
Which we have to attend.
So, every morning i spend half an hour chatting to other people at work.
And, then i work until lunchtime.
Usually a group of, maybe five or six of us go and have lunch together somewhere.
We, just have a quick snack lunch, sandwiches.
And then head back to work for the afternoon.
Again we have to attend our tea breaks, at quarter to five.
No, quarter to four.
And they generally last a little bit longer than they should do.
So, quite often i just go, straight home after i've had my cup of tea.
I tend to relax for a couple of hours, and watch the television, make myself something to eat.
I like cooking so i usually make something nice.
And, then, i get ready, and i'll go out somewhere.
I have a few different groups of friends so, i might meet, anybody when i go out.
And we usually just go to a quiet bar somewhere.
Have a few drinks.
And, i'm generally home, by 11 o'clock.
Because i don't stay up too late.
And, then i can get myself a good night's sleep before the next day's work."
"I've got a dog and a cat.
And, they're both, about three years old.
Uh, my dog_ we were planning to get a very small dog.
But we fell in love with a puppy... And, she was ten weeks old, and she had very intelligent eyes.
Um, we took her home and, she is huge now.
Ha, and, she's, uh, type of dog, 'deer hound,' that does grow enormous.
But fortunately, she's only half deer hound.
So she only comes up to mid-thigh level.
Uh, she's... Very scruffy looking.
Um, we called her Sable because she's got dark fur.
Um, but she likes playing a lot.
And she's lots of fun.
And she's very clever.
Um, my cat on the other hand is very lazy.
He's a big white fluffy cat.
And he's blind.
He was born with no eyes.
Um, so he doesn't do very much.
He tends to lie around in the sun, or in the garden.
Because he likes being outside.
Um... But, uh, he gets played with quite a lot by dog.
Who tends to, jump on him, ha, and decide to play quite a lot."
"I've lived in a number of different places.
And, almost everywhere i've lived i've had the chance to join, a good choir or a small singing group.
It's a great way to make friends and, of course i enjoy singing a lot.
Some of these groups have been really, good, some of them, not so good musically, but still fun.
The last place i was living, i was there for seven years.
And after i'd been there, for a year or so, i joined a really good choir.
Also a part of that choir is, a ballet group.
And these ballerinas are really good.
We sang, most of our music in the language of that country, and... I think i was the only one who wasn't a citizen of the country.
But fortunately, i did learn the language and, we had to sing everything without any music, so we had to memorize all the words.
It was a great opportunity, uh, the choir found sponsors to pay for, trips, and we got to sing... Number of times in London in Paris, in Athens, in Berlin, and in the Kremlin in Moscow.
When we traveled... We would have, uh, rehearsal from, early in the morning, and do_ stay in the theater all day and do the show at night.
And usually get back to the hotel around one in the morning or something.
But, whenever we traveled, they'd make sure we had at least one free day, usually two.
And, that was a good opportunity for me to see a lot of places i wouldn't have seen otherwise.
On my free day i'd, explore the city, maybe go to a museum.
Sometimes if i knew someone in the area i'd, meet up with them.
Right now i've just returned to live in the U-S, and i've just joined another choir.
It's really different from the last one that i was just in.
But i think it's also, a good choir, and i hope it'll be a lot of fun and that i'll make friends."
"My friend and i were playing baseball, last week.
And we went to a baseball field.
It was just he and i that were playing.
My girlfriend was with us.
But she decided that she wanted to take a nap in the outfield.
Um, so she took a blanket and she was laying down.
And she was in_ she was pretty much out of the way.
She was in the safe place for the most part.
But, a little bit later in the afternoon, my friend was, batting and i was pitching.
And i threw the ball and he hit, he hit the ball relatively close to her.
And she was sleeping and she had no idea the ball was coming toward her.
So i started yelling, and the ball just missed her.
I saw_ the ball just missed her.
So i started yelling at her to move.
And she wouldn't listen to me.
She was just sleeping saying that everything was okay.
So screaming and screaming and screaming at her to move, and she just wouldn't move.
So i got fed up and thought that &quot;all right fine if a ball hits her she deserves it.
She deserves to be hit she's being too stubborn.
&Quot; so i said to my friend, &quot;Nick you know what, go ahead and hit her.
She deserves it.
&Quot; on the very next pitch, he hit the ball real real hard and it hit right into my leg, and dropped me.
I i fell down in serious pain.
My girl friend came running over.
It was very ironic.
And he'd hit me so hard that the stitching on the baseball left imprint on my leg that lasted for about two days."
"Yeah, talking about languages, i, i think the best, place to learn a language is, the country, or place where that language is spoken, freely and openly.
And, uh, i mean it's like, i've been studying English, i mean all my school and college years.
But there are certain aspects of spoken English that, um, were completely new to me, when i, when i got here.
And it's like, uh, one day i was in a friend's house in London.
It was a Sunday and, um, my friends had gone to church and, i didn't go to church on that day.
Because i go to church on on a different day of the week.
And then there was a knock on the door.
I opened the door and this, this guy just stood there.
And, uh, he didn't say hello, he didn't say hi.
He just stood there and said something like, 'BT mate.
'  So i said, 'what.
' He said, 'BT mate.
'  He had to say it for the third time before i got it that he was saying, that he was from BT and he had come to check on the phone hehe.
You know because, uh, ba_ back home whenever we never refer to one another as, as mate and things like that.
So, ha ha, this guy just came_  and, uh, well this was another culture shock.
I mean, where i come from, um, when you open a door to somebody the first thing he says is 'good evening or good day' or, or whatever.
But, uh, i mean i opened the door and the guy just said 'BT mate' 'BT mate' so, i, i, really found that very very funny."
" uh, i was fourteen when i started learning English.
And at first it was very difficult.
Um, before that, i had, um, learnt how to speak Russian, and little bit of French.
Then we came to English, it was just too difficult for me.
I just couldn't understand the way... Words and grammar were set up.
But then, um, i thought to myself that okay what's the point of learning a language without being to able to speak it.
So i decided that, um_ i was in high school then, i decided that from time-to-time i'm gonna flunk out of some classes at school and, go to one of the touristic sites near my high school and started talking to tourists.
So uh, after about a year or two, my English started to get really good.
And then i started getting offers, to go, um, go interpreting, you know as a, paid job.
The first time i interpreted, um, was for... For an American professor who came to Vietnam to teach about preschool education.
And, it was my first time.
I was very green, meaning very inexperienced.
And um... But i did a good job, because i knew that i was not, all that good and that i needed, to pay more attention to what i did.
And so... It wa- even though a little bit intense, but it was very good.
And from then on through, um... By words of mouth, i got a lot more offers.
And since i was very responsible for what i did, i had offers from, many interesting and, supposedly high-ranking people.
So my job with, um, the American embassy was, um, the result of such a process.
And i got an offer to start interpreting for the ambassador.
And um, i understood that it was... A huge responsibility.
But starting.
Um, i really_ i really tried my best and, um, started to learn more about different things, political, economic_ and, um, i think you need to have a very good knowledge.
Um general knowledge when you work as an interpreter.
And also, um, you have to understand the cultural characteristics of,the country whose language you are interpreting into, and that_ and your own language.
So, um, i think i did a good job.
And, um, that's not, only what i'm saying.
But i got a lot of compliments from people i worked for too.
So i think being an interpreter is very interesting after all. "
"On my seventeenth birthday i, decided i really wanted to start learning to drive.
So, mom very bravely took me out in her car.
And we uh, drove along the country lanes.
But, within a few minutes, i uh, drove up the bank.
Which was, a bit embarrassing.
But, she, she saw the funny side of it, and laughed it off.
And uh, we carried on.
It took me about six months to learn, um, with lessons, and also going out with my parents in their car.
And just practising, going up and down the roads.
And practising to reverse in the drive.
All the useful skills.
Before i'd actually passed my test though, i was driving with my dad, and, uh, i drove into a wall, which was really frightening.
'Coz all the people around heard the crash, and came out to see, and picked up the pieces of glass.
Fr- fortunately, my dad was very supportive, and didn't shout at me.
Surprisingly enough, and was very good, and we just carried on driving.
It did put me off a little bit.
It was a very frightening experience.
But, i carried on, and i started driving the next day again, so i wouldn't lose my confidence.
And i've been driving ever since.
It's possible that i'll need a car for my placement, on my course this year.
If so, it'll mean buying my own car, which will be very expensive.
But, if it means getting a better placement, and maybe having a better job, it'll be worth it.
So, hopefully, i won't need one, but, it's possible."
"Once upon a time there lived, a young girl, who lived in the woods in the countryside.
She was the most beautiful girl in the whole land.
Her mother doted on her completely.
She even made her a beautiful red riding hood.
This red riding hood made her look so beautiful that everybody came to know her as Little Red Riding Hood.
One day her mother made her some food and said to her, &quot;take this food which I have made and bring it to your grandmother who lives through the woods,&quot; Little Red Riding Hood said, &quot;yes i would like that very much.
&Quot; Little Red Riding Hood took the food from her mother, put on her little red riding hood, and set out through the woods.
As she walked through the woods, she came upon the wolf.
The wolf saw how beautiful she was, and came up to her and said, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood where is it you're going.
&Quot; and Little Red Riding Hood replied, &quot;i'm going to the woods to my grandmother's house.
&Quot; well the wolf desired to eat her right then and there.
However there were some woodsmen nearby.
So the wolf decided, to wait and he made a plan, he said, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood, if i go one way through the woods, and you go another way through the woods shall we see who comes to your grandmother's house first.
&Quot; so Little Red Riding Hood said, &quot;yes let's do that.
&Quot; so the wolf set off on the shortest, quickest way to grandmother's house.
His fast strong legs carried him through the woods and he very soon arrived at grandmother's house.
Little Red Riding Hood on the other hand, she took the longest slowest way through the woods.
And she picked berries, and nuts, and flowers for her grandmother.
When wolf arrived at grandmother's house, he knocked on the door and said, &quot;grandmother let me in it's Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, and the grandmother replied, &quot;i'm in bed, the door is open, unlatch it and come in.
&Quot; so the wolf unlatched the door, came in and ate up grandmother, right there.
He took her clothing, put it on, climbed into bed and waited for Little Red Riding Hood to arrive.
Little Red Riding Hood took her time picking berries hehe, gathering nuts, and gathering flowers.
Finally she too had traveled through the woods and arrived at grandmother's house.
She knocked on the door and said, &quot;grandmother it is i Little Red Riding Hood may i come in.
&Quot; and the wolf imitated grandmother's voice saying, &quot;i am in bed, unlatch the door and come in,&quot; so Little Red Riding Hood unlatched the door, and came in, the wolf said, &quot;put the food on the stool, and come into bed with me Little Red Riding Hood.
&Quot; so Little Red Riding Hood put the food on the stool, took off her little red riding hood and climbed into bed with the wolf.
&Quot;my what great legs you have grandmother&quot; Little Red Riding Hood said.
And the wolf replied, &quot;the faster to run with.
&Quot; Little Red Riding Hood said, &quot;my what great arms you have,&quot; and the wolf replied, &quot;the better to hug you with, my dear&quot;.
Little Red Riding Hood said, &quot;my what great ears you have.
&Quot; &quot;the better to hear with, my dear,&quot; the wolf replied.
Little Red Riding Hood said, &quot;my what great eyes you have.
&Quot; &quot;The better to see you with&quot; the wolf replied.
&Quot;grandmother what great teeth you have.
&Quot; &quot;the better to eat you with my dear&quot; and the wolf ate her up right there."
"I am a French student, and i’m studying in England, um, and i cam_ the first time i came to, really live in England, was four years ago.
When i was sent as an (Erasmus) (resident) student in Edinburgh, it’s not England it’s Scotland.
Um, but i have to say that, it was my first really real contact with Great Britain.
And i fall absolutely in love with the country.
It is certainly not the food, and it is not the weather either, but i don’t know_ i can’t really define what it is, but whenever i come to England, i feel really happy, um, and whenever i come back to France, um, although i am joyful, i am not as happy as when i’m here.
Um, i’ve always wondered, um, what it was that was making me so happy in England.
I’ve came to the conclusion that it might be, um, the fact that i’m living here a cosmopolitan life.
By opposition to a French life.
If i was in France... I would be French in France, speaking my own language, um, and staying in my home place.
And also i might have some international friends.
It is not the same as being a really_ foreigner in a different countries with, a, a culture which is close enough.
But still different.
Um, and most of the people that i’m in contact with are also foreigners, living in a different country than their home countries.
And um, i- it’s, it’s a, it’s a very different lifestyle.
It’s, it's very cosmopolitan in a sense, and, um, most of cosmopolitan people are very attached to travelling.
Um, to moving.
They are not opposed to settlement.
But i think the picture_ they do not picture their life, um, in one single place.
Living on the same, spot, um, for, um, more than few years.
And, um, also most people who are cosmopolitan, um, have generally a lot of friends all over the world.
And a lot of contacts, which also makes them, um, want to travel a lot.
As a French person, uh, in England, um, i’ve always been asked, um, 'why do you like England.
' Because most people, most French people hate England.
And most English people hate France, um, i’m not quite sure this is true, most French people i’ve, i’ve met really, um, don’t really care about this whole iss- issue about hating the English.
Um, although the French call them roast beef.
But, on the other hand, most English people i’ve met, um, really_ don’t really care about, um... Hating the French.
I have to say that it’s most of the time an advantage to be French.
This, this sort of French girl, um, reputation, um, but, uh, it’s, um, also sometimes i’ve been called 'froggie', but it was mostly a joke.
And, um, i have to say that with Europe.
Especially, i think that people are getting closer, and away from this, um, stupid, um, antagonisms that used to exist.
And people are becoming more and more aware that we are not that different.
And that we have a lot to share, instead of fighting against each other."
"Four years ago i introduced a Korean man to the original Jersey.
He's Korean American, and comes from New Jersey.
So i was able to tell him that the Jersey that I knew was, where the name of his locality, originated from.
I was able to tell him about the life that you can lead over there.
Whereby, you have to work hard.
But you've got u- the benefits outside of work of the wonderful beaches and countryside, into the bargain.
There is a world-famous zoo on the island as well.
With lots of very interesting animals, that hopefully are being conserved for future generations.
The island has a network of green lanes.
That mean that you're able to walk more freely round the island, without fear of coming up against cars, and having to back into the side of alleys.
And worry about the speed at which they might travel down them.
They're ideal for cycling around, as well.
And it's very nice indeed, when you spot, um, a green lane sign.
And you know that you're going to enjoy the rest of your walk, if you take that route.
You can walk around the island very easily.
You can journey on a bus around the island, in the matter of an hour.
You've got views over to France, from the north of the island.
And, you've also got the, notion that, it's a little piece of England that's been bitten off by France.
'Cos it happens to be quite near.
Twelve miles away, from St.
Marlow, for example.
They have very, local customs, making things like, black butter.
And talking a patois, which is a mixture of French and Celtic languages from England.
Such as Cornish.
You have, perhaps, an insular people.
But, a friendly people as well.
And an island that's governed by it's own parliament, as distinct from the parliament that we have in the British Isles.
Held in London, and now in the Welsh Assemblies, and in Scotland.
You have different, currencies.
They still maintain the one pound note.
Which is quite a novelty for people who journey from the mainland.
Who've known their pound note to have, been, done away with several years ago now.
There are lovely place names around the islands.
Adopted from France.
And it is a place which you will always hold a dear, part of my heart, as i went to school there.
And i enjoyed bringing up some of my family there.
And, now one can see that friends are looking to go there.
So i hope that i'm going to gather up a package of leaflets, and memories, that i can forward to them.
To help them enjoy the place to the full.
And indeed to look beyond it's shores to the neighbouring islands of Guernsey, Hark, Sark and Herm.
And maybe then onto France.
There are lots of visitors to the island each year.
Particularly at the time of the Battle of Flowers.
So we hope that they can hold those memories as well.
And encourage more people to, come back, as they, in- indeed do, year upon year, to the island.
And look to the new things that are being built there.
And the new generation that's unfolding."
"Um... I came to Oxford in nineteen-ninety-two for the first time.
Because, i wanted to, to learn English.
I wanted to speak fluent English after all.
Because, i did study English in school, and i had a very nice teacher, who lived in, in England for a few years.
And he was talking to us, uh, in English all the time.
So, he advised me to go to England, so I did.
And uh, when i arrived here... I felt, it was a strange thing, but i felt like i was coming back home.
Even though that i came here for the first time.
And, uh, anyway i didn't know anyone.
I didn't have addresses of, um, of people that i_ that was coming from my country or something.
But, uh, the very first weekend i already had a group of friends from different countries.
So i stayed here for, two years.
I stayed here for two years, and, uh,i did enjoy it very much.
Hm, i did all sorts of things.
First i work- i worked as an au pair, hehe, and i lived with a family for three months.
And then i moved_ i lived on my own in, uh, Y-W-C-A, which is a kind of youth hostel or whatever.
And, um, there i met people from all over the world.
And, um, i also did, courses in English language.
First in, uh, Lake School of English then in Oxford College.
And, uh, i did a few examinations like, uh, Oxford Preliminary and First Certificate ... And um ... Then after two years i decided to learn another language.
So i moved.
Uh, i wanted to go to Italy.
But it was completely different things, and i missed Oxford all the time, uh, i also lived in London for, four months.
It was a nice change but after all_ but after few weeks i stopped really enjoying it, because London was too busy ... So... Uh ... Weekends i used to spent in Ox- back in Oxford again, because it was much calmer.
And um all my friends were already here and then after four months living in London, i moved to Oxford again.
Same place Y-W-C-A haha which was kind of my home.
And, um, and i remember when i left_ when i left England for, for good i was very very upset hehe i felt very upset.
But_ because i decided to do other things, i knew it was... The thing that i had to do, anyway.
And, uh, it's nineteen ninety-nine now.
I'm back in Oxford visiting some people.
And, um, and England which i like ver- which I still like very much.
And uh, Oxford is still the same.
Hehehe, nothing much changed.
Uh, it's nice to be here again but, i can't put up with the weather really.
Which is surprising, surprising enough.
Um... I, i also visited London, twice already.
And, uh, i found it... More exciting that_ than i used to, find London a few years ago."
"Fairy tales are mostly based on older stories and sometimes on quite primitive, belief.
And this is a, a tale that comes out of China.
And it's a tale about the importance of water.
We tend to take it for granted.
We just turn on a tap.
There was a time when water, was life.
And to insure that the waters came, sometimes there would be sacrifice.
And sometimes that sacrifice would have been human.
And this story leads right back to those days.
There was a girl and she was called long hair.
She was called long hair because her hair, hung down her back... Almost to the ground.
And her hair was as black as a raven’s wing.
I don’t know what her real name was.
So we will call her Long Hair.
And every day, Long Hair would have to go with the other girls of the village, to fetch the water.
And the only water, came from a stream.
It was a mile away down a hard rocky track.
And it was hard work fetching that water.
And quite often as she came back with the water on her shoulder, Long Hair would look up at the mountain that, stood by the road.
A tall mountain, so tall it was called lofty mountain.
And she would wonder why no streams came trickling down it.
Because most mountains have streams, don’t they.
But not lofty mountain.
And one day, Long Hair went for a walk up the mountainside looking for, plants that she could feed to her pigs.
When she saw this giant leafy plant, growing out of the side of the mountain.
And she took a hold of it and she pulled, and she pulled, and out came a giant turnip.
And out of the hole, that the turnip left in the ground there came bubbling... Water.
Water coming out of the mountain side.
Trickling down it towards the village.
At last... Thought Long Hair, we have got water going to the village.
But suddenly there was a great swirling of wind.
And that wind plucked the turnip from her hands, threw it back down into the hole.
And then it picked up Long Hair herself, and sent her swirling up, up, up, right up the mountain.
And threw her down in front of a cave.
Where there sat an old man with a long beard and a very fierce expression.
'You.
' He said.
'You have discovered the secret of my water.
I am the spirit of lofty mountain and that water belongs to me.
And for discovering it you should die.
You should be turned into stone.
But if you promise, never to tell a living soul of the water, I will let you live.
''I promise,' shouted Long Hair.
And with that, that swirl of wind picked her up and sent her whirling down, down, down, down the mountain side, and threw her onto the grass.
She picked herself up and she ran home just as fast as she could.
But she'd had such a fright.
And do you know what happened to her hair.
It turned white.
No longer flowed down her back.
As black as a raven’s wing.
It was white as a waterfall.
And people wanted to know, what had happened, but she couldn’t tell them.
You wouldn’t want to be turned into stone, would you.
Now, shortly after this disaster, struck the village.
The stream... Dried up.
There was no water.
And without water the village would die.
And then long hair became angry.
'I know where there is water,' she said, 'follow me.
'And she left... She led the villagers up the mountainside to where that giant turnip grew.
And she took hold of it and she pulled and she pulled.
And out it came.
And out from the whole it left, as though glad to be free, came burbling and trickling,the water.
'Quick,' she said, 'chop up that great turnip.
' Which they did with their knives, just in time.
For suddenly there was this great swirl of wind, that frightened the villagers and send them scurrying back down the mountainside.
And it picked up Long Hair again and swirled her up, up, up, up the mountain.
Threw her down in front of the cave.
Where the spirit of lofty mountain sat, and he was angry.
'You betrayed my secret,' he said.
'Now i can’t stop the water flowing... And for that you will die... You will be turned into stone.
I will make a stone statue in your likeness and its feet, will lie in the whole from which the water comes.
And the water will run over your stone body and trickle down through your long hair, like a water fall.
That is your punishment.
'Long Hair trembled in fear, but then she said, 'if that brings water to my village so be it.
But before you turn me into stone let me go back.
Let me go back to say goodbye to my mother.
'And the spirit of lofty mountain took pity and let her go.
'Be back, by nightfall.
' So down she went.
And she said goodbye to her mother.
And as_ on the way back, walking slowly and sadly across the meadow.
She also went to say goodbye to her favorite tree.
We all have got favorite trees, haven’t we.
And she hugged the tree.
And to her surprise a voice came out of the tree.
'Don’t worry Long Hair,' it said, 'i will help you.
'And out of the tree, there stepped a man and he was dressed in green.
And his face was green.
And he had beard and hair of green leaves.
He was the spirit of the tree, a green man.
'I will help you,' he said.
'I will make a stone statue in your likeness.
All I need for it is your Long Hair.
'So from her head he cut the long hair.
And from a stone he fashioned a statue.
And to the statue he fastened the hair.
And together they carried it up the mountainside, and they laid it with its feet in the hole from which the water came.
And the water, it trickled over the stone body, and ran down through the long white hair like a waterfall, with all the colors of the rainbow in it.
'Long Hair,' said the green man, 'your courage has brought water to the village.
Your courage has brought life to the village.
Now you go back down... And live in peace.
' And back down to the village beside the stream, walked Long Hair.
And to this day the people of that village look up at the waterfall... And give thanks, to the girl they remember as Long Hair.
What happened to her.
Well it wasn’t long before her hair, grew again.
And you know what color it was.
That's right, long and black as a raven’s wing."
"My parents both came from Hungary.
And when I was born, I first learned to speak Hungarian.
And I didn't learn English until I was five when I was entered into school.
So now I'm very happy about that because I can read and write very fluently in Hungarian.
My parents, came over to, America from Hungary, uh, in the late eighteen hundreds.
And we had_ there were seven children in my family.
There were two boys and five girls.
I am the, fourth, youngest of the girls.
And we each have our own s_ type of talent.
Uh, I have a sister that plays the piano beautifully.
She has quite a nice talent for that.
And another sister that plays the violin.
Uh, my sister Margaret is a very good artist, and she designs and makes her own clothes.
I do, bits and pieces of everything else.
I'm fond of music.
And when I was living in Florida, I used to, dive into the ocean and bring up sand dollars and then make them into jewelry.
Well every_ each one of us has, managed to get around the world.
I did most of the traveling.
But now my heart is set on traveling to Denver.
That is where my granddaughter is.
I have a daughter Susan, her husband Ken and my granddaughter Rebecca living in Denver and this summer I hope to visit them."
"Um, I sort of consider-_i wouldn’t say I was English, or, or British even.
I consider myself like a_ I mean i’m not a world citizen 'cause I haven’t been everywhere yet, but I wanna be.
Cause i’ve got family, you know, bits and pieces everywhere.
I’ve got, my dad’s side of my family in the, Ukraine and Canada.
And sort of dotted all over the place.
And i’ve got my mother’s side of the family in Ireland, and Scotland.
And i’ve got an unrelated father, my mother’s first husband who lives in Ibiza.
He's got a studio and somehow, he completely blacks it.
And he sits on the ground all day playing his guitar, making money.
Don’t know how he manages that.
I wonder if i’ll be able to do that one day, but I doubt it.
He’s, he’s a lucky man.
He’s sort of_ i’ve only met him once or twice he’s always got loads of funny stories about smoke bombs engulfing his village and, his m- m- m-, uh, anyway.
And i’ve got my own father who’s very, very dear to me, even though he doesn’t realise it obviously.
Um, he lives in Oxford and he's_ came all the way over from Canada.
It was his life, his life mission, from Winnipeg this little tiny vil- uh, town at the time.
I’ve got to be a doctor at university in Oxford.
Just one day he was told it’s the best university in the world, for the time.
So, he was like right i’m doing that.
And he worked his arse off.
Uh, worked really hard and um, somehow managed to get over here and escape his, his, his, mother’s, uh, sister who’s really funny.
Aunt Sally is really funny.
She’s seventy-nine, and she still works.
I don’t know how she does it.
She’s tiny.
She lives in a, she lives in a country where there’s like six, seven foot snows some winters.
And she is not six, seven foot.
She’s like_ she reminds me of a, a little China doll or something.
Or like a very, I mean sh- she doesn’t, she doesn’t look like she belongs in her bodies.
And, big face and a little body.
And blue hair.
And she’s been like a hairdresser all her life so, my dad obviously never likes having his hair cut.
Um, and she comes over to England all the time.
It’s a shame she’s never been to Ireland, 'cause Ireland’s like a beautiful country.
I’ve got to go visit again soon.
Um, most of family have, been there at one point or another.
My sister, who’s, um, a mother of two children, used to live there.
She’s, she really loves her kids.
It’s good.
Uh,  I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t mind her being my mum instead of my mum.
'Cause Becky, my sister, is just, she’s, she's learnt all the mistakes.
She, she, sussed it out.
She’s sussed out.
She’s been on, on the wrong end of s- of so much stuff, uh, being a teenager, she juts understands children.
And and she’ll do anything.
I mean she’s completely enthusiastic.
She’s completely enthralled by children.
I mean she’ll do anything.
She’ll go to any means to be closer to her kids and to other kids.
She’ll shave her head, do you know what I mean.
To see_ so that her babies will recognise and, and, uh, and associate with her in a better way.
And, she’s, quite an incredible woman.
I like come over to her house, she lives in Cowley and she’ll be fixing a bike, cooking dinner, changing a nappy, and drawing a picture at the same time.
And then I come through the door and she goes, 'oh right Lucas how’s your day.
Has it been good.
' And she’ll be completely, she’ll be completely ready to deal with anything.
Other days it’s not_ she can’t be like that every day obviously.
But that’s the way I like to think of her."
"Um, i go to one lesson a day at college.
I don’t have to go on Wednesdays, because the college, is, uh, pretty darn good.
They know how to split my week up.
So i, i go to college on Monday and Tuesday.
And that’s like easy.
It’s not much work involved.
It’s not like, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, weekend.
Week again.
It’s like, hmm, Monday and Tuesday.
Hmm, take a break for a day.
Hmm, you know, lean back do the rest of the work.
Go and_  su- sunbathing and that, and then turn up on Thursday two thirty-five in the evening for another lesson.
And then, can stroll home and turn up on Friday at the same time.
So this is like a laid-back college.
I’m only doing one A-level.
But i_  i mean, i turn up_ if i’m late they go, 'oh you’re behind schedule.
' That means you need more oxygen and more energy.
'Cause oxygen’s good for your brain_ making your brain think, and making your body work quickly.
So they go, &quot;go and make yourself a cup a coffee with loads of coffee in it and, have a glass of water, with loads of sprinkly air in it, and its sparkling water.
Cause that’s good for your brain.
So i really appreciate this method of being nice to me.
It doesn’t always work.
'Cause they’re, so nice.
The teachers are so friendly and it’s so, it’s so offhand.
I mean your_ there’s like five rules.
One of them being that it is a_ illegal to call you teacher mister whatever.
It has to be Maggie, or John, or Clive, or whatever.
And they cannot call you mister Triggs, or whatever.
Mister Johnson.
And y- y- you’re not allowed to wear a uniform.
And you have to enjoy yourself.
And they just have these silly rules.
You have to try.
I mean they have the basic ones, like you to try your hardest.
And there's like a rule that, you have to use common sense.
But i mean it, it makes a class_ i’m not sure how well it makes the class work.
'Cause we’ve got Katie and Anna who, fully take advantage of every little loophole.
One day Katie doesn’t feel like sitting on a chair anymore.
I mean, Katie and Anna are like famed for, complaining about uncomfortableness.
We used to sit on wood chairs.
It took them about a term, and now we’ve got leather chairs.
Two of us have got leather chairs.
One of us_ i mean it’s, it’s they’re all like sixty quid each.
I mean we do pay a lot of money.
But we’ve got some comfy chairs now.
You should come and check out my college.
And i’ll put in a good word for you.
Um, and like Katie will just say, 'oh, i don’t,' both of them have done it.
Katie and Anna have both done this.
They just say, 'i don’t want to sit on my chair anymore.
'  They just lie down on the floor.
Put their legs over the table and just go right on having the rest of the lesson like this.
And you can’t say anything.
Because... It’s bad for your back to be sitting like that anyway.
It’s unnatural.
D'y_did you come out of your mother, sitting down on a chair.
No.
You’re like straight.
Humans shouldn’t even stand.
They should walk along.
They should crawl along, do you know what i mean.
Should be like_ 'cause you, you’re asleep.
That’s the natural position.
Completely, um, horizontal.
So just_ i, i reckon we need some sort of skateboard effect they said.
And they did actually get away with this quite a few times.
But they’ve got a bit bored of it now.
But they just_ they’re, they’re just phwww_ compete with each other to come out with more outrageous stuff that they can get away with.
And they can_ they’ll run circle around the teachers.
They’re so intelligent.
And Katie’s being educated since, since she was born.
And like she’s, she, she, does take it for granted, i think, how well she’s been educated.
How lucky she is, that from such an early age.
And how intelligent she is.
She takes it for granted.
Uh, but i think anyone would if, if they’re in a position Katie was.
Basically, she’s blonde, and she’s smart.
A pretty good combination there innit.
And, and, she’s just got a knack of doing things.
Same with Anna.
They have completely outrageous characters.
They’re always, exploding with laughter everywhere.
And, and, crashing in to things, and laughing about it.
And, they’re real party people.
They’re really, really, really long dancers.
Really good.
They’ve got good rhythm and that.
I mean give me lots of excuses why.
And it’s helped me get out of tricky predicaments in college.
And it’s dropped me subtle hints and that.
It's not like Oliver and Jenny.
Who're quiet.
I mean i’m quite a quiet person.
But, i mean these two are quieter than me.
Especially Oliver he doesn’t say a word.
But he’s probably the most intelligent person in the class.
He can get twenty out of twenty with his eyes closed.
But he’s, he’s, a very, very, very sensitive person obviously.
He’s like_ cares about a lot of things.
And he, he does make a difference.
I think the world will be a lot of pla_ a better place if a lot more blokes were like Oliver.
I mean he’s not interested in... Going out.
He’s not, he's not interested in acting like other people.
He’s not interested in, being big for the sake of being big.
He, he is not the sort of person that, wants to do something for someone else.
He, he wants to help someone because he wants to help someone.
And that’s like the end of it.
He_ and he helps someone, and then he’s just done it."
"First, started really, uh, the, the journey of magic sort of_ i don't know.
About nineteen, twenty that was the first, conscious, awareness of it as such.
I mean, there were, there were ripples so to speak earlier on in my life.
That i don't care to sort of mention.
Because tha- that was so long ago.
Um, but, from what i've been aware there's sor_ a journey.
Um, that, uh, a_ anyone involved in magic has to sort of... Pass along.
And, as you do you learn that, not just, the destination is the important point.
But the journey as well, itself.
It is the route you take.
And a lot of people that i have ment_ tha_ their_ that i have met along the way.
Have been worried about, whether they've, been wasting their time.
Whether they're doing the right thing being where they are and that sort of thing.
I think other people might relate that and just_ in, into a general sort of purpose of being.
And whether they're wa_ h- how most people, wonder, whether they're doing the right thing or not.
Um, as i said_ going back to this subject.
Um, some people worry about, where they are.
And what they're doing.
And whether they are wasting their time.
Um, i generally reply that i- i- it's_ that they shouldn't worry about it.
Th- tha_ most people are, uh, at school still.
They're still learning they don't have to worry about, this time wasting business.
There's very few people that have left the learning sort of stage, i- uh, in the realm of, uh...Magic as i understand it.
Is... Is the way the world unfolds.
Its... Its, its like a system of rules that, e- explains why things happen, in the way they do.
But... Uh, it's a different model that, uh, that links up things that don't, seem linked on the surface, uh...One day, uh, a- an- and i will explain this with a, story.
I had to go for a job interview once.
Uh, in Reading.
Which is about, i don't know.
About, an hour away from, from Oxford by car.
I was going by train, and i`d given myself enough time to get there.
I got into town.
Uh, where the train station is.
And then discovered, to my horror, that i didn`t have enough money.
So i was sort of stuck in town thinking, 'what am i going to do.
Uh, i can go home.
But if i go home, i won't have enough time to catch the train.
I can go to the train station but that's not going to help me very much.
Because i don't have enough money to get a return.
I can get a single, but then i will be stuck in Redding.
What do i do.
'At this point, a beggar came up to me and asked me if, if i had any money.
Uh, 'got any spare change guvna'.
' I think that's how he put it.
When he did this i started laughing.
Because it seemed obvious to me what was going on there.
So i reached into my pocket and gave him everything i had.
Which was_ i don't know.
It was about six, eight pounds.
I don't know.
I gave him that.
Um, because that was all i had.
And, he thought i was a nutter because i'd done this.
And then he went off.
And, when_ once i'd given him that.
As well, uh, and there was all this relief, 'ah, yes i know, it is obvious to me what i have to do.
' So i gave him this money.
And then, the next moment someone came round the corner who, who gave_ or lent.
I can't remember which.
But they gave me al- all the money i needed to get there and back.
And i wouldn't have met this person had i not given this beggar all of my money.
Now, to the outside world.
I suppose it seems quite odd that, here i was.
I didn't have enough money to get where i was going.
And, so what do i do.
I give my money to someone else.
Uh, but, to me it seemed, o-, obvious because i was interpreting the situation with a different set of rules."
"For my Spanish class in my junior year, um, we had to do a project that involved making a movie.
And i had never worked with a video camera before, cuz, i never owned one.
And my friend and i decided to do an action flick, because that would be something fun.
So... I decided one day_ the thought just came to me as i was brushing my hair, that we could do a B-movie, horrible movie.
And we could call it Attack of the Killer Sombrero.
And a sombrero is a big Mexican hat.
So it worked in with my Spanish class.
And it took a lot of time and a lot of effort.
But, it was so much fun between me and my friend, and we had blast doing it.
And each scene would take, anywhere from two to four hours to film.
But when we were done we had this final product that was hysterical, and everybody loved it.
And... It was at that point that, i realized that film was something i was really interested in.
And that's one of the reasons i am a communications major now."
"I used to live in a village in Africa.
And I'd like to tell you about the food they ate there.
This is something that they ate.
Almost everyday.
The food had two parts.
One was the sauce, and the other was something that they called <i>uvu</i>.
We don't have that, uh, exact food in English.
So I don't have an English word for it.
But the, uh, <i>uvu</i> was made from, a kind of flour, from millet flour or from crushed corn.
And they would boil that in some water, and some salts, uh, for a while.
And it would become very thick.
Then they would pour it into a bowl... And then they would, pour it_ pour the bowl upside down.
Then they would... Pour the bowl upside down, onto a tray.
And it would, stay the shape of the bowl.
To make the sauce, they would... Fry some chopped onions, and some meat, if they had some meat.
All this cooking they are doing on a, wood fire.
They would, have leaves chopped up very small.
They could use different kinds of leaves.
Sometimes they would take the leaves, the tender small leaves from, uh, sweet potato plants, or from cassava plants.
Also they could go out in the forest and there were certain leaves they would gather from the forest, for cooking.
They would chop the leaves up very small... And, boil them in with the fried onions, and a little bit of water.
They'd boil them quite a long time, until they were very very soft.
Then they would add some peanut butter and boil it, together for about a minute.
Then the sauce was ready.
They'd put it in a bowl,and put it on the tray.
Everyone would gather around the tray... And, they would take their right hand and take a piece of the <i>uvu</i> and they would dip it into the sauce and eat it.
It was really good.
I liked it. "
"Now... Let's see.
One of my favorite things to do now that I have, hardly anything to do is cooking.
And I have... Usually tried to cook different foods from different countries.
And I think some of my favorites is Sauerbraten which is a German dish.
And it's a pickled beef that's roasted.
And we serve it with potato dumplings.
And it's seasoned with spices.
Uh, the next thing I like is Hungarian goulash.
But I think one of my easiest recipes is chicken paprikash.
And I will tell you how to make it.
You take about four, medium onions and you slice them.
And you put 'em in a pan with a little bit of oil.
Until they brown or caramelize.
Then you remove them.
And you take whatever pieces of cut up chicken you like.
And you sort of brown that in the pan.
Don't put any flour, just the plain chicken in the pan.
Then you put your onions back.
And I always add_ you can add chicken broth, but i_ depending on the amount of chicken you put in the pan.
If you use maybe six to eight pieces of chicken, then I would just add like a cup and a half of water.
And then you just cook this until, the chicken is done.
Then you add your sour cream and you_ well, it could be a pint, depending on how much you want.
It has to be like a gravy.
Then you put your paprika in it until it tints to a reddish color.
And you can serve it with, noodles and that's your chicken paprikash.
Other things I like to cook is, Spanish food.
I have a recipe for a, low cholesterol meat ball stew from Mexico.
And I have a recipe for a pork stew.
And, also for the people here where I live, I make pots of soup, twice a month.
And we sell it in the afternoon for a dollar a container.
And it helps people here that can't really get to the stove and cook, that_ have aides come in to take care of them, and it nourishes them.
So that is the end of my cooking career."
"Well, i will tell you about my experience the first time i went camping.
We had_ my daughter had had, a se_ two tents put up.
And we had a spot where you put up a cook tent.
Which is all netting and it zippers.
And we had a place where you could put a camp fire.
It was a pretty good sized plot up in the Vineyard.
And there they had a little country store there.
And they had a Laundromat for you to wash your clothes in.
And they have recycling just like all the, towns around here in the United States.
And they have R-Vs.
If you don't know what an R-V is it's a, a road van, you know, vehicle over the road where you sleep in it and all.
And its back in the pines.
And i_ we have showers there.
You can either go and park where they have all cold water running but_but i remember the one night we had gone to sleep and my daughter had forgotten to, put a cover over the top of the box that had the food in it.
Well the perfume of the island is skunk flavor.
Haha.
Scent.
And, you can imagine as soon as you hit the island you smell the skunks.
So that's what it's infested with is skunks and raccoons.
And, she had forgot to put the cover on the box.
And they had gotten into the cook tent.
There was oatmeal all over the floor.
They ate over two pounds of cookies.
And chewed all the nipples off of my granddaughter's baby bottles.
The place was a wreck.
But when you stop to think about it you have to laugh because it's really a site.
And a gentleman that was on the plot next to us_ the lot.
He was sitting there and a mother skunk came with her babies, across, and they got up on the table and stole his Hershey Bar haha.
And if you could have seen this gentleman, chasing after this baby skunk.
Just to get his Hershey Bar [chocolate bar] back.
Well i'll tell you  he did.
He got his Hershey Bar back.
The only disadvantage of, camping that i didn't like is because we had to walk and carry water back to the camp.
But all in all it was an experience... That i have never had and i really enjoyed it."
"I have an interesting story to tell about, uh, a job interview that I went on, um, in Illinois one time.
When I was being interviewed by the president of the board of directors.
And he was taking me to meet the editor and the publisher of the local newspaper.
And so during our coffee, and our visit with this editor-publisher, and with my board of directors.
Uh, the president asked me a question.
And he said, ""if you came into your office and you looked at your phone messages.
And you saw that you had a phone message from, the president of the board of directors.
Or you had a phone message from somebody with the local media.
Which phone message would you call first"" and I didn't hesitate.
And in a moment I said, ""why of course I would call the local newspaper.
That's what the president is paying me for, is to keep communications open with the media."" and I found in my business experience that one of the things that I have really enjoyed.
Has had_ been the opportunity to, uh, be interviewed by the media.
And, uh, by doing this, ah it's a very relaxed thing for me to do.
Because I certainly had a passion of_ about my work.
And found that, um, I always loved talking about my work.
The only thing is from time to time, sometimes the interviewer would try to catch you and ask you something that was very hot politically.
And you would have to be very careful to, be honest and true and answer the question.
But not get yourself into too much trouble, by giving an honest answer.
So I was very fortunate to have interviewers... Who over time got to know me.
And if they ever had an issue that came up in the community that they felt was going to be of interest to the listeners.
That they would just call Marie on the phone, and she was always ready with a- an answer and an opinion about what maybe should happen.
Or what could happen to make a situation better.
Or to resolve a problem.
And, uh, I always found, uh, that I did enjoy the radio interviews, much better than television interviews.
Because on the television, everyone sees you.
They see, uh, you if you are batting your eyes too much.
Or if you are fidgeting with your hands.
Or if you have funny, uh, facial tweaks, or twirks, or whatever you want to call it.
And it would be, um, very awkward when you would then look at yourself on the television and say, ""oh my, do I really look like that.""  and immediately begin on the diet that you had postponed.
You'd immediately go to the beauty shop to get your hair done.
You'd have a manicure and a pedicure even though they never photographed your feet.
Um, but I did enjoy the radio best of all.
And, uh, would always be up to, um, an interviewer calling me for my opinion on the radio."
" hi, my name is Michael, uh, i'm twenty-one years old, and i'm a college student.
I live in New Jersey and, i went to, uh, Penn State University for my first three years of college.
I switched majors, so i am, going to live back in New Jersey, and go to the College of New Jersey to finish out, uh, two more years to get a degree in education.
Um, when i live at home, i'm with my mother, and my father, and my sister.
My mom's name is Janice, and she's a manager for, a lumber store.
Um, my father was in the, uh, in the army national guard, and he is now retired.
So he just does odd jobs and, helps out with, uh, the the army every now and then.
My sister is a senior in high school, and, uh, she's been recruited for her athletic ability.
And i myself, i've run, uh, cross country and track and field in college.
So, maybe one day we'll both be in the Olympics, or All Americans together. "
" i come from Vietnam.
And, um, i've been here in America for ten days.
And, um, i miss my friends a lot.
I miss my family too, but some how i feel like i miss my friends better_ more, sorry.
But, um... Maybe because when i was home i spent more time with my friends than with my family.
Uh, i have a lot of friends in Vietnam, and they live, um, all over the country.
Some of them live very close to me.
Some of them live about a thousands miles away.
But still we can be friends over the distances.
Um, there are some friends who grew up with me.
We used to learn how to ride bicycles together.
And we are still talking about riding bic- learning to how to ride bicycles.
And there are a few other friends who went to school with me, like, uh, elementary school, and then onto high school.
But the friends that i feel most close to, um, are those who went to college with me because i think, um, when i started going to college, i was already, uh, 16.
And at 16, you know a lot more than you were_ 6 years old.
Um, the only way that i can communicate with my friends back in Vietnam is by e-mails.
I send my friends e-mails every day, and they send me a lot of messages everyday too.
Usually they will tell me about how life is in Hanoi.
Um, especially about the results of soccer game.
I'm a soccer fan.
And um, i just feel like, um... We are so close to them reading tho_ email messages.
I think e-mail messages are very convenient. "
"I come from Plymouth.
Which is in Devon, in the south-west.
But last year to start university, I moved to Oxford.
It was quite a change for me, because, uh, where I live near Plymouth is in the country.
And it's really quiet, and there's animals roaming around.
Whereas, in Oxford there's a lot of ambulance sirens, and traffic, and noise.
I really enjoy living in Oxford.
The, the shops are better which is quite important to me.
And I find the people more friendly.
But maybe that's because, I need to make a greater effort to meet people when I'm up here.
I think I'll probably always see Plymouth as home, because I was brought up there as a child.
And my family are based down there.
And I spent most of my life in Plymouth.
Plymouth and Oxford are both, historic cities.
So there's a lot of tourists, especially in the summer.
So it can get really busy.
But both places have a really nice atmosphere.
And there's always plenty of uh, sights to see, and places to go."
"A funny story is when i had my first date when i was fifteen.
It was with a boy, that i met through my brother, from his school.
We decided to meet in the town centre, and have a look around the shops.
And we also went to the cinema.
Afterwards, he offered me a lift home on his motorbike.
But i refused, because i wanted to be independent.
So i said i was going to get the bus home.
So he walked me, to the bus stop.
I was too embarrassed to put my glasses on.
So i couldn't see the bus number.
So i, unfortunately, managed to get on the wrong bus.
And ended up twenty miles away from home.
Which is very embarrassing.
So, what i had to do was, uh, phone my dad, who came and collected me.
And i don't think my mum stopped laughing for about a week.
She, uh, managed to hold back, and not tell my boyfriend about this, uh, story.
Because, he would have found it hilarious.
But, uh, she likes telling people about it now.
I don't think i'll ever live it down.
Ha ha."
"My first day of driving on my own, uh, with my brand new driver's license is, uh, going to be a day i never forget.
Um... I was, uh_ i borrowed my parents' car, one of my parent's cars, they had two.
It was a white sedan.
And, i went to school.
And after school, i went to a_ to my hairdressers to get my hair cut.
And i parked it in the, lot.
And she washed my hair, and she, uh, put it up in clips on my head and, cut my hair, while i had a smock on.
And we were chatting, as hairdressers and their clients normally do.
When all of a sudden, i realized that... The place was completely empty, except for the two of us, my hairdresser and i.
And i was wondering, what, what was going on.
And, as i was thinking this, someone came back into the store_ into the shop.
And, they said &quot;does anyone out here_ does anyone in here have a white car.
&Quot; and i said &quot;well i have a white car.
&Quot; and he said &quot;well, it's on fire.
&Quot; and, i jumped up and i screamed, and i ran out the door, and i saw my parents' car.
It was_ there was smoke coming out of it.
And there was fire trucks and police cars and, wailing sirens, and everyone was looking at this car.
And here i was with my hair up in_ my wet hair up in clips, on top of my head, and in this smock and looking like... I don't know what.
And i could not believe this has happened on my first day.
And i thought ,&quot;what is my mother going to say.
What have i done.
&Quot; and... A policeman came over and, we called my mother, and, when i told her what happened, she said, indeed &quot;what have you done.
&Quot; ha ha, and the policeman explained to her that there was_ that it was caused by some loose wires in the trunk.
Well anyway, it did turn out not to be my fault.
But i was very shaken.
And i thought, this might a bad omen, that there was going to be more incidents like this in the future.
But fortunately that hasn't happened yet."
"Okay one of the books that i read recently is_ was written by, um, this guy who was in the same, uh, university orchestra that i'm in.
And, we went on tour recently.
And i heard that he'd written a book.
And, at this point he'd just graduated.
Um, so i went up to him and said, &quot;tell me about your book, you know, tell me, everything that you wrote in your book.
&Quot; and he s- it was about the American ethos.
And i, i thought it was gonna describe, you know, what Americans think about, what are American values, all those kind of things that i thought i would have opinions on.
And i wanted to hear him talk about it.
But instead he said, &quot;oh, you know, give me your address and i'll send you a copy.
&Quot; so, then i really didn't talk to him very much after that.
And the tour was over, i went home, did other things during the summer.
And then i went on this little trip.
And when i got home, there was a package for me.
It was this book.
And i was so happy that he'd, remembered to send me a book.
And, you know, people even don't remember to send me e-mail or a call, much less send me their book.
And it was like a present, you know.
So i read it.
It was really short.
And... It did talk about what Americans think and value, and how we can_ what are some American problems, and how we can try to solve them.
And i guess just reading it, uh, made me pretty hopeful for the future."
"Hello.
I’m interested in, helping people learn languages.
Especially English, because I grew up in countries where English is not the major language.
In particular I spent twelve years in Indonesia.
And I went to school there, from when I was six to when I finished school.
Uh, and I got to watch, some of the things which happened in Indonesia during that time.
Like the economic development of Indonesia was something.
When I first arrived there I remember there were, no trees in the capital city Jakarta.
And the traffic was horrific.
But after a while, uh, they managed to actually, uh, have the money to, to sort some of these problems out.
This_ and when I finally left Jakarta, the area in which I lived called Menteng, was, a_ really pretty.
With lots of tress and especially, uh, bougainvillaea.
But that was also where President Suharto lived.
He lived in the same area.
Just, uh, two or three streets away from me.
I remember one new years we had tanks patrolling down our street, and when things got a bit tense.
And, um, I left Indonesia when I turned eighteen and finished school.
And went back to London, to study at the school of Oriental and African studies.
And within a few weeks of, uh, my leaving Indonesia, everything kind of, went pear shaped.
Huh_ and, uh, the currency crashed and, uh, separatism in the provinces started happening.
And i’m just now planning my first return to Indonesia since_ there’s a friend of mine runs an East Timor action group in Glasgow.
And we’re going to go and, uh, monitor the elections on August the eighth.
So my first trip back to Indonesia, may well see Indonesia disintegrating."
"I’ve just got a new job, and i need to change my daily schedule.
I need to be able to wake up at 7 o'clock in the morning, and have some breakfast.
Which is_ i live with my mother now.
I’ve moved back home.
And, uh, she always has grapefruit, which i love.
So i’ll have half a grapefruit.
And then i’ll cycle off to work.
Which takes me about an hour.
And then i’ll have to start work, which is, uh, not very exciting.
Simply, typing, words into a computer.
I’ll have half an hours break at about 12 o'clock, and i can cycle into the nearest shop and buy myself a sandwich.
I like to, have a different sandwich each day so that i don’t, well of course variety is the spice of life.
At 5 o'clock, uh, work finishes and i’ll have to cycle back, down, to where i live.
Which is a lovely cycle ride actually.
I did it today.
Takes about an hour.
But it’s all along the canal that goes north/south through Oxford.
And for quite a while you’re going through countryside, through farms and the fields.
Which is very nice, if you’ve just come from a big city.
After i get home, i might_ i, i usually check my messages on the internet.
And, hehe chat with friends.
I might go around to a friend’s house, or vice a versa.
We usually have supper quite late in my house, because none of_ nobody in my family has lived in England very long, and we are constantly being caught out, by the latene-, by the time at which it gets dark.
Which gets later and later as summer goes on. "
"See music has... Always been very much a part of my life.
And of our_ of my family life.
My mother, played the piano and the organ.
And she studied_ she was a music major in college.
And my father played the violin, and the, the mandolin.
And he had a beautiful bass voice.
And he sang in the men's glee club in college.
And then we were always very much involved with the church as we were growing up.
Because my father had studied to be a minister, before he went into education.
And, uh, my mother was a minister's daughter.
And of course there wasn't a lot of social life around that part of the country out in the midwest at that time.
We sort of lived in what you call a bible belt.
So we were brought up_ we had family music sessions around the piano at home whenever, someone felt like having music.
My mother would play anything from... From classical she'd would play opera and all_ anything that, you know, we were interested in hearing.
As a matter of fact this was how we got a_ we_ a good education in music.
Just from the different types of music.
She would play and explain to us what it was all about.
She was very patient.
She was a teacher also.
So, um, we, um, she would have_ taught us to sing parts... So one of us hehe would sing alto, or, y'know a couple of us'd sing alto, and a couple soprano.
And, uh, hehe, we would get involved in singing in church.
You know, putting on special musical programs.
Or we'd be sitting in our pew at the church and whoever was in charge of the music would call on, my sisters and myself to sing a whole verse of, of a hymn.
Hehe just harmonize on it.
And then one of the amusi- amusing aspects of this, uh, musical ability was the fact that back in those days and out in the, the country there was very little, uh, music for funeral services.
So whenever there was a funeral and there was no music available.
We were called out of school_ out of class to come and sing, sing music for the funerals hehehe.
So, we became very adept at just picking up anything, whatever we could, and doing what we had to do.
Hehehe but it was a very interesting time.
And then it was interesting, um, late- in later years when members of the family would die.
Uh, it just seemed to be sort of symbolic for us to all gather at the church.
And gather round the piano or the organ.
And the organist would play anything, th- the favorite hymns of whoever happened to be deceased at that time.
And everybody gang- gathered round and we would harmonize and, just have a jolly time.
It was just, like we were_ ce- it was a celebration of the life of this person."
"Okay, so in my leisure, i love, drawing, and painting.
I'd love to, to know, more about it.
Um, um, actually, uh, i was told, that i was quite good at school.
And th- that made me, enjoy it even more.
And, um, last year i started painting and i, i bought some acrylics.
And i quite loved it.
Really i, i did some portraits.
Like, you know,  i don't, um, copy.
Um, now i'm starting to copy things.
But, um, before i just painted, uh, my_ from my imagination.
And, so i painted, um, a few, um, heads on one sheet.
And actually, just afterwards i realised that they all looked like my family.
My father, my mother, my_ my sisters and brother.
Um, it was quite astonishing to, to see them coming for_ coming out of the picture like that, yeah.
And, um, well, i did, uh, maybe two, two more paintings.
And_ but, i had no more time, time to really go into it and, um, i hope i'll be able to do some more now.
But, uh, now i, i'm focusing on drawing_ just drawing.
Um, i sometimes copy out of books, uh, some anatomy, or you know, animals or humans.
I love it.
Just to, um... To learn more about it.
You know to, to understand the shapes.
And, then i think i will be able to, to draw better from my imagination if i already know some shapes, and things like that."
"In my job at the post office, i met a Korean American, customer.
He would come in, with packets to send.
And i, also realised that he would like to buy some phone cards.
So, i told him that the ones we had, were quite colourful, but not quite as colourful, as the ones that i had sold, where i'd lived previously.
They would have animals, and windmills on.
He was happy to buy the British ones though.
At the supermarket, i would meet lots of very friendly colleagues, and i would make friends with the customers that i had there too.
One of my customers would be a very happy man.
Who would come in, always smiling, and keen to talk to you.
He worked in the traffic office.
I discovered this after he came in several times.
The colleagues that i worked with, weren't just working in the supermarket.
They had other ideas of what to do in their time, around working there, and what they would do in the future.
One lady who worked there, also worked at a local museum, and she was looking to work further afield.
She, ended up having a post at the museum in Oslo, Norway.
Where she is looking into making museum service, more modern, for younger people to be able to come and look at items.
And gain a thorough understanding of the past.
Matthew, was a colleague who had a very interesting job in the holidays, when he wasn't working at the supermarket.
And that would be helping out, a T-V producer.
He would walk the, the man's dog.
And he would help write an article in a magazine, about, T-V and what it is to people around the world, in the modern age.
Another colleague was into politics.
He was studying politics, and he would be working at the supermarket to gain money, to go and study in Germany, at a later date.
I've been able to keep in touch with these people.
And that means a very good deal to me.
I like to think that they did it_ enjoy their experience working in the supermarket, because it gave them a perspective on life, that they might not have known.
Supermarkets are a very democratic place.
You meet all sorts of people, because everyone tends to have to go and shop sometime, whether they like it or they don't."
"One of the aspects of, uh, um, common people that, is interesting about Americans is that they're really well behaved with each other, even if you are a stranger.
So that makes it really nice, um.
To live here, because if you have to stay in a room waiting for some doctor and you have strangers there, it's really nice that people wish each other, and make some small-talk rather than just sit- sitting there stuffed and, you know, ignoring each other.
And it's, it's a very nice aspect of U-S that they greet each other like this."
"I am a student at the College of New Jersey.
I, have been going there for four years.
This is my last semester.
I graduate in December.
Um, and my daily routine, for this semester, goes like this.
I wake up every morning around ten-thirty.
I don't like to get up too early.
Um, my classes usually begin around eleven.
So, before classes i like to take a shower, clean myself.
I try to eat some food before um, class, but that doesn't usually happen.
Then i have to walk over to the academic buildings.
It takes about ten minutes for me to get there.
Um, i get through with my classes, which are, consecutive.
I have two classes usually a day, and they are_ they go one after the other.
After classes i come home, and i eat lunch and, just hang around a little bit, hang out with my friends.
And then we, eat dinner together, and then we try to look for something to do for the evening to have fun.
Um, after that, we just relax and go to sleep."
"When, when i started playing the drums.
Um, i found it_ i found i enjoyed it.
And, i found it was i- in some ways like juggling.
You, you do a certain number of movements and then something happens.
It's not visual though it's, it's sound.
You, you can hear the result.
And i found it was very simple.
I've always wanted to learn to play the piano.
But i could never afford a piano.
And i never had anywhere to put a piano.
But the drums were very easy.
Um, when you play a hand drum there's only three different_ there are only three different strokes that you need to learn.
And then after that it's all a simple combination of that.
Um, and that's basically drumming.
Um, there's the jammy aspect.
There's the listening aspect.
Um, there's, there's learning all that sort of thing.
And, th- that is part of the general sort of, thing that you find with playing any instrument.
Um, i found it rewarding to start off with.
And i think that was why i carried on doing it.
I found also that if you play for a long period of time you tend to si- sort of sink into it.
A- almost like a trance or something.
Friends have told me, uh, well a friend of mine went to do a study on Shamans [spiritual healer/psychic] in South America, or Mexico, or something.
And she said that they use the drum, to sink into this trance-like state.
Before they went off to see what future held in store, and that sort of thing.
And i've seen_ i, i've seen enough friends sort of play.
And they do focus.
They do get a sort of calm of the end th_ and end of the day it's not so much the loud banging noise that, that you get, immediately to start off with.
But it's the focusing and, after an hour or so, you, you come away still.
And after four hours of it, you come away with even more stillness.
And, and weird things do start happening.
Um, we once played.
There were a group of us, um, i think about twelve people.
In a community centre not far from here.
And it's an old church.
And we played there for, about two, three hours.
And, that was one week.
And i could've sworn blind that i heard someone singing.
And i thought, oh, yes it's just the acoustics of the room.
So i moved everyone around.
But that didn't help.
I could still hear them singing, and no-one else could hear them.
Um, and i asked my friends, and they said that i was banging on about something.
That they_ you know, it was rubbish.
And, um, it was al- all the stresses of fatherhood they said.
The next week it happened to a couple of the other people.
They were, sort of, sat there, and one of them even starting singing along with this chap.
So i knew that other people had started hearing.
And then, while the group stopped at some point.
Because they just all got freaked out by this thing.
That, you know, you, you play, you play your instrument.
You don't expect to be joined by all these, these weird chanting voices that everyone can hear.
Um, later on, i told it to the janitor who looks after the place.
And he sort of gave me this wizened old look, and said, 'ah, well, the funny thing is that i lock this place up at night and i can hear banging some nights.
And lights go on that i have definitely switched off.
The lights go off that i've switched on.
So i wouldn't be so surprised about that sort of thing.
' He said.
And, i wondered whether he was pulling my leg.
But, i've got to know him over the years.
An- and i think he was serious.
So_ we never played in that_ it's separate. 			"
"I've studied the piano for twelve years.
I began actually when i was eleven.
Although... I had been introduced to the piano when i was six or seven years old.
But, i did not, like it very much.
Uh, so i stopped taking lessons.
But, around age eleven i got interested again.
And so i was introduce, uh, introduced to it.
And this time i liked it.
And this time... I actually practiced.
So... I can, uh, when i found out that i, had some talent, i continued to practice.
And i got better.
And... I stu_ i wound up studying for twelve years.
Piano is, uh, piano is not a difficult instrument to begin.
But it gets very difficult... Later on ... You have advanced, to a certain level because you're using all ten, of your fingers.
And each one of them could be doing something, independent... Of the other.
There're some instruments where you use five fingers.
Like the violin, where your left hand... Uses actually only four fingers.
Uh, to play the notes to fin- uh... You use four fingers to, uh, place on the strings and,uh, to produce the pitches.
And the other hand simply draws the bow back and forth.
Whereas in piano... All ten fingers are used.
Uh, now every instrument can be difficult, but piano i've been told, is one of the most difficult uh at the advanced levels.
And it got to the point, for me_ i did not get... To the most advanced levels.
But, it came to the point where i had to practice two or three hours a day, to... Remain at the level that i was.
And eventually that became, too much time and i had to stop."
"I love to travel.
One of the, favorite places i've always wanted to see was Pompeii, in Italy.
I had read so much about it in school that i was very curious to see, what it was, was like.
However, i expected nothing more than a big hole in the ground.
And here when i arrived at Pompeii i was so surprised to see that it was a complete city laid out street by street.
They had cobble stone streets that the chariots used to run on.
And they had horse troughs that the horses used to drink the water from.
And down each street, there were houses that were still intact.
The structures were very ss-, very strong.
The only thing that had been ruined were the roof_ was the roof.
And then, uh, as we walked up and down these roads, we saw the bakery where the kilns still had bread in them, petrified bread.
And we went to where they had the hot baths and, uh, saunas as we call them.
And they were done with the hot stones.
And, uh, further on we saw where they had the amphitheater.
And it was huge.
But the, the stage was so far away.
But it had been erected so that the acoustics carried the voices, entirely around to all the audience.
And, i liked it so well i went down on the stage and i made my little performance there.
So after we had been to Pompeii and saw the, the people who had died were now in, uh, done in marble.
Because they had, uh, expired as they were running or perhaps eating or sleeping.
And, their, their poses were not, uh, were not very_ couldn't, couldn't really appreciate their pose because you were thinking of a person who was fighting for his life.
And then, uh, after we saw the, the urns that they had saved and dug out, and the dishes.
The walls of the buildings had these mosaic paintings on them.
Beautiful paintings, and the colors were still as bright as the day that they had been put on.
So i was so fascinated with Pompeii because i didn't expect this much, and it was quite a thrill, to see, all of the beauty that had been erected so many years before.
And so after we finished in, Pompeii we thought we would like to go to Athens and see the Acropolis."
"Have you heard of the story of Princess Rose.
Well, here's how it goes.
Once upon a time, Princess Rose, was the daughter of the good king.
And she was loyal, and she was loving.
But in the neighbouring land, there lived, the cruel king.
And one day, they heard the drums of war.
And the cruel king was advancing to the border, to fight the good king.
And, so a great battle ensued.
And the good king was overcome, and the cruel king threw him into the deepest, darkest, dungeon.
Princess Rose was distraught.
And she went to the cruel king, and on bended knee, she begged him to release her father, who was such a good man.
But the cruel king, merely laughed, and refused.
And was about to send her on her way, when suddenly he said, 'stop.
I will release your father, if you can answer this riddle.
If not, i will have your head off.
''You must come back to me,' said the cruel king, 'naked, but clothed.
On horseback, but on foot, and you must, give me a gift, but not give me a gift.
' So Princess Rose, went on her way, and she thought, and she pondered, and she puzzled, and she wondered, and one day she found herself, walking by the seashore.
And she noticed the fisherman, casting their nets into the sea.
And she had an idea.
And she asked them if she could borrow one of their nets.
And she took it with her.
And the next day, still pondering, she found herself walking on the high moors.
And there was a little tiny pony, that if she sat on, her feet would touch the ground.
That night, as she sat in her attic room, she opened the lattice windows, and in flew a white dove.
And she gently stretched forth her hand, and caught the dove.
The next day she approached the cruel king.
And he looked at her, amazed, for here was a young girl, naked, but clothed, in a fishing net.
Sitting, on a pony so short, that her feet touched the ground, so that she was walking as well.
And as she came towards him, in her hands was a white dove.
And she reached her hands out to the king, and he stretched his out, to receive the gift, but at the very moment before he touched, the gift, she released the dove.
And it flew up into the sky.
And the cruel king looked at her in amazement, and smiled.
And said, that she was the sharpest and wittiest woman in the land.
And the good king was released, and they all lived happily ever after."
"My husband and i have had many problems with the I-N-S, that stands for immigration and naturalization services.
We just got married this June.
And my husband has actually never been able to come to the United States because, they have not given him his visa.
He went to the embassy three times before we were married to try to come and visit me.
But, he was denied every single time.
The first time he went, he, basically, i think he probably should have denied because he went and he didn't really know exactly where he would be staying, and he didn't have my address or anything and_ of course that was only after we'd known each other a little while.
The second time we went, i actually went with him to the embassy in Ecuador.
And, they wouldn't even let me help him talk, because the way the embassy sees it, is that the applicant himself has to prove that he has enough ties to the country so that he will return.
And they won't even let friends or, family in many cases help them, during their interview in the embassy.
So he was denied a second time.
The third time i really thought he was going to get his visa.
I had done a lot of work here.
I had got him accepted into an English as a second language program.
My dad had filed an, an invitation letter.
One of my friends, um, who lived near the university had filed an invitation letter saying that she_ he could stay at her house.
And we had everything very well organized he had his bank accounts, he had everything ready.
And so he went to the embassy.
He was very well dressed, and the person told him he didn't have enough money, even though he had a lot of money in the bank account.
So we were very very frustrated with this embassy because, they won't let anyone come even as a tourist.
It's, very hard to come from any country in Latin America, with the possible exception of Argentina and Chile.
So, um, we've been together for three years.
He was my boyfriend for three years and then, we've been married... A little over two months.
And i, i'm in the United States and my husband's in Ecuador because, the United States government won't let him come here.
But hopefully, his paper work will go through, because i believe that once someone gets married, they should automatically get, a conditional permanent residence. "
"In the city where i live, Heritage Weekend each year, means that i'm able to see buildings that are all around me, but i perhaps don't realize what's behind their facade.
One building in particular that i remember viewing, was a museum, g- devoted to real tennis.
It is an active tennis club.
They even make the balls there still, the tennis balls.
And they show you how this is done, with the fabric, and all the needles necessary for strong stitching.
When you can sit in the gallery, and watch the tennis, you might think that the balls are going to fly towards you.
But there is a net to stop this.
The building is quite an old one indeed, it would have been in the city from early, early times.
The walls are painted dark black, with lines halfway up them, around the perimeter.
And these are used as conventional tennis court lines might be.
The rules, no doubt, are different.
Indeed, i haven't ascertained fully what the rules are.
But i enjoy hearing the sound of the ball thwack against the wall.
And, hoping that i am safe where i'm sat in the gallery.
The building has been used in an episode of Morse, which is a T-V program, which many of you might have seen round the world.
I believe Morse played a match here.
Whether or not he won, i'm not quite sure."
"The favourite book was th- i've read recently is called <em>Red Mars</em>, by Kim Stanley Robinson.
It is the first in a trilogy of books.
And, it covers the selection the first hundred people that are to colonise Mars.
And, it follows them, through their travel through space, to the planet.
How they set up their first living quarters.
And to the stage where, everybody's fairly well settled and the initial developments have taken place.
The second book, <em>Green Mars</em>, um, carries on with, building larger, bigger cities throughout Mars.
The diversification of characters continues by a continual influx of people onto the planet, trying to escape problems on earth.
And, it covers quite a lot of political, biological, an- and a huge spectrum of factors.
It also deals with the colonisation of the planet itself.
And, the atmosphere that they're trying to create in order that humans and animals can breathe.
Um, it deals with plants that are specially genetically modified to be able to cope with the conditions that are, currently surrounding the planet.
It's an absolutely fascinating read.
It goes into a lot of detail about all the different, techniques that are used in order to build the machinery required.
And plants that are needed.
The way they eat, live, and, i think it's definitely worth the read.
It makes colonisation of Mars sound far too believable, and as though it could happen tomorrow with no problem."
"I’m, um, really passionately involved with music.
Especially Reggae.
It is... It’s broughten_ it’s taken me out of uncountable depressions.
It is, the music.
It’s old and yet somehow, it is better than the cutting edge music that’s coming out of Britain at the moment.
I mean like, you get_ dance music in Britain is the best, anywhere the world.
It is the new cutting edge music.
It’s the new technologies, right.
It is, it’s the techniques are incredible.
They’re so far ahead of our time.
We are_ especially for our size, it's in incredible, that we can do this.
But, Reggae is far better in my opinion.
Because it’s so old and i- it can still compete, within me.
It can still compete with these new cutting edge technologies.
Um, and it like Ska music, what, what Reggae came from before it was Reggae.
Before it was... Before it was rock steady or something before that.
I mean it’s like this_ it’s, it’s, it’s so nice.
It’s so calming.
It's so real.
It’s got, it’s got, authenticity.
It’s got reality in it.
It’s, um, it’s real, magical, beautiful, love, love music, you know what i mean.
Real_ and it’s got nice_ it’s the got the percussion.
It's like this beautiful.
And it all molds together.
The, the vocals are beautiful.
It’s got_ the vocals my favourite part undoubtably.
I mean Reggae like, originally, i think, there’s something about Reggae being Reggae because, no one could afford a decent system.
A decent music system at the time.
No one could afford some decent speakers that could, make this base sound proper.
And so they, somehow it was Reggae.
Um, i’m not quite sure how it happened.
But there’s so much focus on the, on the words.
And i, i just go for it.
I just appreciate it.
It’s like, it’s like jazz.
Jazz has got, um, the music, the beats to it are, incredible.
And they’re like all over the place in (xx) and that.
So it_ though_ the extent of those beats to me is the extent of the, the words in, um, in Reggae.
And there's just countless Reggae artists.
There's Anthony B, who does, he’s done, stuff that is being played like, right now.
In this year.
I don’t know how old he is.
He’s like seventies or something.
Seventies music Reggae.
And it is just_ it’s, it’s_ they’re really big tunes.
They sound big without being loud, yeah.
They’ve got, um, he’s got, he’s got this album, which no one has, that i know.
Which i need, it’s it’s got like everything in it.
It’s got a tune for every topic practically.
And, and in all of it there’s, there’s like this religion in it, you know what i mean.
And, i can, i can even associate with this religion because it’s, it can be it’s_ this music can be widely spread to everybody.
Anyone can listen to this music.
It says that in itself.
Um, you can be from anywhere and anyone can appreciate this.
Then again it’s not the most popular music.
I’ve met quite a few people who aren’t into it.
My aunt for instance.
But just because she doesn’t appreciate Bob Marley or the &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry or Peter Tosh or Meka Teng, doesn’t mean she knows everything.
And doesn’t mean she knows about Reggae.
Cause that’s_ Reggae’s got, got it.
It’s go something to it."
" one of my hobbies includes running.
Uh, it started back when_ well, actually it started before i even i got in high school, when i was forced to play baseball.
Um, my parents, i guess, wanted me to be, a baseball player, along with every other American boy, and the American dream.
Um, then when i got into high school, i realized that it just wasn't the sport for me and i didn't want to go on with it.
And, one of my friends introduced me to running.
Uh, so i guess i started with the, uh, track and field team, my freshman year in high school.
And... What really got me interested was how successful i was in it.
My very first race i got second.
So, if you are good at something, you tend to like it more.
Um as i went on at high school, i, i received more awards and won more races and, enjoyed running more and more.
And i got more into the sport.
Um, so now, i run cross country along with track and field, uh, which_ are the distance events.
Um, when i went to college i i kept up the running.
Uh, ran for Penn State and, uh, made the varsity team there.
So i i was pretty successful early on.
Um but then some injuries, uh, kept me out from running, probably up to my potential.
At least i think would be my potential.
Uh, that, but that goes with the sport.
Uh, anything from broken bones to hurt ham strings and, muscles.
Um, along with running, competitively with the schools, i also, uh, run road races which are just, local races that, uh, communities have anything from three-mile race to, ten-mile races.
Uh, so that might help me continue on, further when i want to, uh, run after college in marathons... And, uh, longer races.
So we'll see where it takes me. "
"Um, about three months ago i came back from a two-year, trip away.
I went to the Far East.
And, um, i visited many places.
First of all i went to Hong Kong.
And then i, got the slow boat to China.
To, um, travel around the south-west extensively.
Um, up to, um, Tibet.
But it was, um, China that i'd always wanted to visit.
I hold a sort of, deep fascination with, this culture.
Um... But travelling around the south-west was very interesting.
There were lots of different minorities.
And, it was very exciting to be away from home and, experience, sort of, um_ just to, to, to, to be in an, an_ a completely different country.
And, uh, s_ it was so exciting and, um, uh_and then after i_ after south-west China, i flew to Tibet.
Which was probably the highlight of my trip away.
And, um, and it was just so fascinating to see these, um_ it's like stepping back in time really.
To stepping back to the min_ mid_ medieval, ages.
And, um, it was... Uh, um, well_ it was, just so, so diverse and, so, um_ the religion is amazingly strong still.
Even though, with the Chinese, um, taking over since sort of nineteen-forty-nine.
And it's_ it was just so exciting to be there and... To witness these sort of_ this c- very unique culture and... Yeah, i mean it was, was really good and worth... Worthwhile going there."
"I'll tell you about my family.
In my family, there's my father, my mother... Myself and two older sisters... My father was born in the United States in Detroit, Michigan, and then when he graduated from high school he entered the navy.
And the navy stationed him in Scotland.
And he worked on a submarine in Scotland.
And when he was in this, uh, little town in Scotland, he met a young woman, who, would be my mother.
And so my father, whose name is Carl, married my mother, whose name is Helen.
And they moved back to the United States.
When they were in the United States they, had a daughter and her name is Julie.
And then they had another daughter, and her name is Denise.
And then, my parents and their two daughters moved back to England, and that's where I was born.
However, at the time, I was almost born, in the Netherlands, but my parents decided to, make sure that they got back to England while the- while they were staying in the Netherlands for that short period of time.
So I was English, and then, around the time I was three, we moved back to the United States.
And we've lived more or less in this one area for, twenty-two years.
And so my father has worked as a salesman for a company which makes, memories for very powerful computers for_ eh_ for computers in business and the government.
And my mother has stayed at home and raised a family.
And one, of my sisters was working in law.
However, now she has four children and so she's very busy raising four children.
Her husband, travels every week for four days to, um, Arizona as well as Ohio.
And, my other sister, her husband is currently living in London, but, um, she's been working at a company and she's been leading people on trips to Mongolia.
And_ but she will be going back to London and perhaps staying with this business, I don't know.
And uh, I haven't had one steady job for a long time.
But I've done some traveling, in America and now I'm back here with my parents and near my two sisters.
So we have a Scottish person, uh  three Americans and a English and, Scottish person in the family."
"Yeah, i, i always wondered why we had such narrow streets in, uh, in our capital Freetown.
It wasn't until i got here that, i, knew, haha, the reason.
Hahaha.
You know i used to think well, i mean these guys must have been very, very mean.
It must’ve been because uh, the, the mosquitoes keep biting them, that_ that’s why they haven’t taken time to make the roads a little wider.
But i mean when i got here.
. .  I, mean the, the streets here are not, any more wider than they are in, in Freetown.
So i, i take all_ i take back all my words that i have been saying hehehe against, um, the British for making such narrow roads.
Because, i tended to compare the roads that we had in, in, in Freetown to the roads they have in, um, Francophone west Africa like Abidjan.
. .  No_ in Abidjan they have_ i mean, the, the roads leading from the airport to the city center, um, i mean are just vast, they are just wide.
I mean they are complete contrast to_ i mean the the kind of roads we have in, in Freetown.
. .  And, uh, you know with that i, i used to think, that_ well before i got to know a lot ab_ about Britain i used to think, uh, it’s perhaps, you know that the mosquitoes did not allow the, the Brits to really, um, um, lay good foundations in Freetown because_ they did have a, a problem in Freetown.
In fact Freetown was referred to as the white man’s grave.
Because a lot of the colonial peoples, the settlers, died from malaria.
But, um, you know, in spite of that.
I mean after_ before, um, and after independence, Freetown, and Sierra Leone as a country, was really on, on a sound footing.
When it came to things like education, um, we were referred to as the Athens of West Africa because... People from all over the west coast, you know, went to Freetown for their, University education.
I mean from Nigeria, from Ghana, from Gambia, and of course Liberia, you name it.
Unfortunately, uh, we had a couple of decades of, poor leadership.
And all those institutions have, gone down the drain, to the extent that, you know, people have to go outside Sierra Leone to get, quality education.
I mean when i went to, Kenya to study, my classmates, could not believe that, it was because, um, my discipline was not being, taught in Sierra Leone.
They they thought i went just to Kenya, uh, as an exchange student.
Because i mean they still remembered that the very first African, vice chancellor of the University of Nairobi, was a Sierra Leonean.
So i mean, they had that regard for, Sierra Leoneans, and the level of education that they had.
But , uh, that was past glory, that we are basking in.
But i mean the country is still, beautiful, i mean it’s beautiful to look at.
It’s just that the, the, the war has been, you know, causing a lot of problems.
And, uh, to my mind the, the root cause, of, that, war in Sierra Leone, is, the, the minerals that the country, is blessed with.
I mean these blessings are becoming like a curse now.
Because like, the diamonds and the gold, um, have become a source of problem instead of a, source of, you know respite.
Um, in the thirties, not necessarily the thirties, in the, the sixties and, up to the seventies, Sierra Leone was a net exporter of rice, which is its staple food.
But when you add the mineral rush, both gold and diamond... People, flocked to the, to the minefields.
They spent less time on their farms.
And because they could strike gold, and become rich over night.
Instead of, having to.
To sow and wait for the harvest and things like that.
So, the, the, the case now is, we have become, um, a net importer of our staple food, rice.
Coupled with all the problems that war has brought.
But, um, the Sierra Leonean people are a very resilient one.
And, uh, if only peace could be given a chance, people are ready to bounce back and to pick up their lives again, and to, to move forward."
"Most, um, storytelling cultures have their stories about simpletons.
Someone or some, creature who appears to be rather simple, but in the end, makes good.
And this is a pretty story and it is called, Simple Jack.
Now Jack was thought to be quite simple.
And when he went off to work, he went to a work for a farmer.
And on the first day he worked so hard that at the end of the day, the farmer gave him a golden penny.
And Jack was so pleased with that golden penny that he, tossed it up in the air, as he went home.
He kept tossing it up in the air.
And he was crossing over the stream when, 'plop.
' Into the stream fell the golden penny.
And was lost.
And when he got home, his mother said, 'Jack, what did he farmer give you today.
'Jack said, 'he gave me a golden penny, mother.
' 'Well, where is it.
' Said his mother.
'Oh mother, i i dropped it in the stream.
' 'Jack,' she said, 'you haven’t got the sense you were born with.
What you should have done with that penny, you should have put it in your pocket.
Now you remember what I tell you.
'So the next day, Jack goes to work.
At the end of the day the farmer is so pleased that he gives Jack a lovely jug full of milk.
And Jack remembers what his mother told him, so, he pours that milk into his pocket.
And he goes sloshing, sloshing home with milk in his boots.
And when he gets home his mother says, 'what did the farmer give you today, Jack.
''He gave me a big jug of milk, mother.
''Well, where is it, Jack.
''Well, mother, i remembered what you told me and i, i put that milk in my pocket.
''Jack,' she said, 'you haven’t got the sense you were born with.
What you should have done with that milk.
You should have balanced that jug on your head, and brought it home that way.
Now you remember what I tell you.
'So, the next day... Jack goes to work for the farmer.
And at the end of the day the farmer is so pleased, that he gives Jack a puppy dog.
And Jack remembers what his mother told him so he, balances that puppy dog up on his head and tries to walk home with it that way.
But the puppy dog doesn’t like it up there.
He jumps down, runs away, and is never seen again.
And when he gets home Jack’s mother says, 'what did the farmer give you today, Jack.
''Well, he gave me a puppy dog, mother.
''Well, where is it.
' Said his mother.
'Well, i remembered what you told me mother and i, put it on my head, but it, jumped down and ran away.
' 'Jack,' she said, 'you haven’t got the sense you were born with.
What you should have done with that puppy dog, you should have, put a bit of string around its neck, and led it home that way, saying, &quot;come on, boy.
Come on, boy.
&Quot; now you remember what i tell you.
'So, the next day Jack goes to work, and he works so hard, and the farmer is so pleased that the farmer gives to him, a great big leg of pork.
And Jack remembers what his mother told him and he puts a bit of string around this leg of pork, and pulls it home behind him saying, 'come on, boy.
Come on, boy.
' But as he goes through the village all the cats and the dogs come out and they take a big bite out of that leg of pork, until there is nothing left, but the bone.
And when Jack gets home his mother says, 'Jack, what did the farmer give you today.
''He gave me a great big leg of pork, mother, for Sunday lunch.
''Well, where is it.
' Said his mother.
'Well, I remember what you told me mother and i put a bit of string around it and pulled it home saying, &quot;come on, boy.
Come on, boy,&quot; but all the cats and the dogs came out and they ate it all up.
''Jack.
' She said, 'you haven’t got the sense you were born with.
What you should have done with that leg of pork is you should have put it on your shoulders and carried it home that way.
Now, you remember what i told you.
'The next day Jack goes to work and he works so hard and the farmer is so pleased that at the end of the day the farmer gives him, a donkey.
And Jack remembers what his, mother told him.
And he hoists that donkey onto his shoulders.
And oh, it is so heavy.
But he goes staggering home with that donkey on his shoulders.
Now it so happens that one his way home, he passed the house, of a very rich man.
And that rich man had one daughter who was very pretty.
But that daughter, had never smiled.
Had never chuckled.
Had never laughed in her whole life.
And her father had said that if any man or boy could make his daughter laugh, he could have her as his bride.
And he would also give him all his gold.
And it so happened that the girl was looking out of the window, as Jack went by with a donkey on his back.
And she began to smile, and she began to chuckle, and she began to laugh.
She had never seen anything so funny in her life.
And her father heard her laughing and came running down, and said, 'what are you laughing at.
'And she said, 'why father, look at that boy out there with a donkey on his back.
I have never seen anything so funny,' and she laughed.
And her father went running out and said, 'Jack, Jack, put that donkey down.
I will take the donkey, you can have my daughter to be your bride, and you can have all my gold.
'So, Jack took the hand of the daughter, and led her to his mother.
And his mother said, 'Jack, what did the farmer give you today.
'Jack said, 'he gave me a donkey, mother.
''Well, where is the donkey.
' Said his mother.
'I swapped him, mother, for this beautiful girl, who is going to be my wife.
And whose father is going to give me all his gold.
''Jack,' she said, 'you are the cleverest boy in the whole wide world.'"
"We didn't have a cat for a couple of years after one of our cats had died.
And my parents didn't really want to get a pet because it was always hard for_ it was always hard for us the kids when one of the pets would die.
But a lot of people used to bring in pets to where my dad would work, cuz, they would find them on the streets and they would need new homes.
So one day... Someone, one of the ladies who works for my dad, brought in a little cat.
And she was little and she was pretty calm.
And, my dad picked her up and, he took her and, she just sat on his lap all day.
And she was all cuddly and cute.
And she was all so friendly.
And she would follow him around.
And my dad thought, this would be the perfect pet for my kids.
So he, packed Snickers up in this little picnic basket and he brought her home in the car.
He hadn't told any of us.
Then he got into the house and, he just told me_ he's like, &quot;Stephanie, there's something in the car, go out and get it.
&Quot; so i went out into the car and, i pulled up this picnic basket, but, all of a sudden this little head popped out.
And i was like, &quot;it's a cat, it's a cat.
&Quot; and we were all so happy to have this cat.
So i brought her into the house and, all sudden she saw four little kid faces and eight little hands trying to reach out and grab her.
And she ran and she hid in the closet.
And, from that very day on she hasn't been very friendly."
"Our family cat, Snickers, is not very friendly at all.
She is actually probably one of the least friendly cats.
Um... Actually the other day my sister had to take her to the vet, because she had_ i don't know if she got cut or she was bleeding.
So my sister took her to the vet.
And she also needed to get some shots.
So while they were at the vet place, Snickers was okay because it was just my sister and Snickers in the room.
Now when the vet entered and wanted to put Snickers on the little examination table and, take her blood because she thought she might have feline leukemia.
Well Snickers didn't like that and she started like, kind of, &quot;meow,&quot; and she started hissing and trying to move all over and she started trying to scratch.
The veterinarian, which she couldn't even do because she was declawed on her first, front paws.
But, she just kept trying to... Gnarl and, hiss and trying to get away from the vet.
So the vet had to leave, and she got back, and first she just put on this little muzzle so that Snickers couldn't bite her.
And that worked a little bit.
But Snickers was still moving around and she kept, making loud noises and trying to get away.
So the vet had to go and get two helpers.
So now there were two helpers, with a little muzzled cat just to take out blood for her.
That pretty much describes for how Snickers is."
"I'll tell you about my family.
I have an older sister, she is two years older than me.
She lives in Florida now and she teaches at a college there.
She teaches Asian religions.
She lived in India for a few years and, she still works, translating hymns from, Sanskrit.
She does a lot of traveling and speaking.
Then I have a younger sister who is seven years younger than me.
And she lives in Texas.
She is a lawyer.
My two sisters are very different from each other.
So my relationship with each one is, different.
It expresses a different part of me.
Then I have a brother who is two years younger than me.
He lives in Philadelphia and he's a chiropractor.
And, he's also a jazz musician.
My parents live in South Jersey, still.
They came to New Jersey from Boston.
My father worked as an electrical engineer.
He studied physics and he's still very interested in, ideas, and... Different ideas about the universe and things.
My mother is more down to earth, and she really puts up with a lot, from us huhu.
They are both very involved in their church.
They do a lot of activities through the church.
My grandparents came here_ all of them came as immigrants.
They came into Ellis Island and had their names changed, to sound more American.
One grandmother came, from Turkey.
She came because there was a civil war in her country.
So, all the women had to leave the village, go into the city.
And her village was destroyed.
She came here with her cousin.
My other grandmother also came_ she came from Crete.
She was about eighteen.
She came all alone.
I can't imagine how she did that.
But I think she mostly came because, she liked to read, and, the men in her village_ she couldn't find anyone intelligent enough to marry.
She had to hide her books because the other people made fun of her.
So maybe that had something to do with why she came.
And my grandfather, also came from Crete.
He lived in Egypt for a little while, then he came over also, to New York, and then to Boston.
And my fourth grandfather came from right outside of Athens.
When he came here he had, a, a vegetable truck.
He sold vegetables off the back of his truck.
And I often wonder how it would be for them.
How they, could leave everything, their families and their homes, and have no telephones, never be able to see or talk to their families again.
And I think that, their parents, my great grandparents, lived in villages without electricity or plumbing or running water.
They lived, in such an, ancient way, yet they were not very_ it wasn't very long ago that so many changes, took place in the world in so short, a period of a time.
That it's amazing to think about sometimes.
So, now I live here in this country.
And the age that I am now, my mother had children.
My grandmother, probably had grandchildren.
I don't know.
The way I live is very different than how I would have lived if we were back in the village.
So some things are good about that and some things, are not.
But that's how it is."
"I have a job at the moment, as a student guide.
I work for the university and that.
It's really good pay, and it's good fun.
There's a, good team atmosphere amongst the other guides.
And we always have a good social life, after a, a day of work.
During open days we show parents, and prospective students around, the university.
We tell them about the modular system, at the university, and the facilities.
And we show them the sports hall.
And there's always a lot of questions that, mainly parents want to ask.
Um, once people have got a place at university, we show them round again, during their fresher's week.
And give them a real insight into what university life is like.
And tell a more detailed aspect of University life, and show them round again.
So, i really enjoy it.
Been working today, and had really good fun.
And met lots of new students."
"Right, i've just finished studying a three-year degree, in Oxford.
I've been studying modern history.
And i've mainly been looking at, um, countries, uh, in Asia, in the twentieth century.
And, the one thing about history at Oxford, was that th- they do like you to, to concentrate, at least a little bit, on, um, British history.
Which i wasn't that interested in.
'Coz i've done it previously in, in A-level, um, and degree level.
But, at the same time ha- having studied a bit of British history, you can then move further afield, if you likeso, i've been studying, Japan, um, China and India, mainly, in this century.
Also a bit of, um, Vietnam and Korea.
Which has been good.
And also i've been studying a bit of the United States and its history.
Particularly after the, after the Second World War.
And the way that you study is, it's based around, uh, a tutorial every week.
Which is either, on your own or with, perhaps, one other person.
In which you go along, and you discuss, the topic that you've been working on that week.
Um, and aside from that the ma- materials you use for you, uh, for your knowledge base.
Uh, are basically two.
You can either study with books.
Um, or you can use lectures.
And, i- i first studied with books because you can do it, at your own pace.
And you can follow what you're interested in.
Whereas sometimes a lecture can be boring, or y- you possibly might not be in the right mood for it.
So it's nice just to be able to go home.
Open a book at whatever page you like, and work at your own speed."
"You might get annoyed, if some of your local stores shut halfway through one day, middle of the week, for example.
I happen to, get, perhaps annoyed or, i  should say, more despondent, about the fact that stores don't always shut on a Sunday now.
I believe strongly, having worked Sundays in the past, indeed, that it's thoroughly ideal to have a day, whereby we rest.
Even to let buildings rest is something to think of.
They also suffer.
Cracks in the walls soon reveal that, that's the case.
With humans, of course, those cracks are going to be more devastating.
Your families might end up drifting apart.
Your marriages might become on the line, because you're just not seeing enough time, one another.
You might get to see one another in the working week.
But that's always a bonus if you do, either side of going out to work, and coming home again, and then launching yourself into all the routines that you have, in looking after your homes, and your families.
It is a tradition that we've had in the country, where i live, that, up until, perhaps, a decade or g_ or so ago.
We did shut our stores on Sundays.
I think this gradually got derided, by the fact the garden centre's open a lot on Sundays.
And then the field just opened up.
I can understand that gardening is a thoroughly, enjoyable recreational, and indeed spiritual experience.
But, that aside, i'd like to think that businesses didn't feel that they had to open on a Sunday.
I know that they do, because it's such a busy day.
Apparently it can bring them in more money, than the entire week can.
But i enjoy the fact now, that my week is made distinctive by the fact that i don't work Sundays.
People will still ask me if i want to do overtime.
And i will say, &quot;it happens to be a Sunday, and i do like to go to church.
&Quot; and it stops, it makes them think.
And, um, maybe that's only for a short while.
But, it, it makes them reflect for a little bit.
My Sundays don't mean that i don't work now.
Uh, i'm doing other things.
I'm visiting people.
I'm reflecting on life.
I'm writing letters.
I'm giving my cha- uh, giving myself, chance to have a quiet period.
You can even have a nap on a Sunday.
But if, if i'm trying to address my spiritual needs, i'll be trying to read the scriptures.
People don't have to be doing these things, for Sunday observance to still be applied.
They can just be renewing their family bonds.
Perhaps we will end up going full circle, and people will again look at, opening up their week by closing on a Sunday."
"I'm reminded by friends, that i can't leave the supermarket.
I must always work there, because, it does mean a lot to me.
It is the place where i met my husband.
I didn't know it at the time, but this person was coming in for three weeks, buying things that he didn't actually need, just to get to see me.
He must have come in about three times, and, perhaps i was gaining a recognition of having seen him before.
He would stand at the end of my till, looking very smart in his overcoat.
And he did have ginger hair, which is very nice indeed, i think.
And he purchased some items, and he went to pay for them, with what should have been his access card.
But he gave me his library card instead.
They're both green.
He was apologetic, i reassured him that there was no problem.
The sort of thing that might happen everyday.
And we got talking, about travel.
And he said that, it was always nice to meet people interested in travel.
I had told him that, i had plans, possibly to go to New Zealand, but work wasn't really willing to let me go.
So he said about, a cheap deal that you can get with various travel agents.
And one in particular.
He said that he would bring me in their number.
I didn't really, think much more about this.
But he did come in, the following week, with a letter for me.
Which i thought would just have the number in.
And i waited until i opened it, until supper time that day.
When i did open it, it was a lovely letter.
And at the end of it, it revealed what he had been doing.
That he'd been coming in for three weeks, and he didn't know that he could any longer afford, the money necessary to buy the items, that he was buying.
Because he didn't really need them.
He was just trying to see me.
It said about ringing me, if i wanted to discuss travel further.
I spoke to a colleague about whether or not i should ring, straight away, or leave it.
But i think i knew that i was keen to, see him again, maybe.
And speak further to him.
But all the time i wasn't really aware of possibly how intense his feelings were.
But the next day, i went and rung.
I rang him as soon as i had said good bye to two friends that i'd had round, trying to get them to, become friends, with the common interests that they had in cycling.
I said good-bye to them, and i picked up the phone straight away.
And we were talking for an hour or so.
And when it came to arranging next, when next to see one another, it was surprisingly quickly that he wanted to see me.
The very next day in fact.
So, an adventure began.
I was made to feel very ill by my colleagues at work.
But we met up at lunch time.
We had a nice meal.
Although it wouldn't have mattered what we'd have eaten, because we were very nervous.
He asked me what muesli did i eat... Oh, he asked me what muesli i had in the mornings.
And actually, i said, 'well, i don't do myself any favours.
I don't bother with breakfast.
' And then he said, 'oh dear, i meant to ask you what music you liked.
' And so his nerves were revealed.
And perhaps we could talk easier after that.
Because we had us a laugh, and we just carried on telling one anunner_ another about ourselves.
And what our intentions for life were.
And then there was a next meeting that we would have.
And that was to be, on the Friday as well.
And that was to be the first of many lovely outings, that we would have, and the long life that i hope we lead together.
So it just shows you, that when you're in the supermarket, buying your goods, you never know what might be at the end of the transaction."
"Stories can be told in all different sorts of ways.
They don’t have to be a long narrative.
Um, you can tell a story in song.
The ballad is a story.
Uh, you can tell a story in dance.
Ballet is story.
And you can tell, a story in poetry.
And this is, uh, an old Cornish folk tale that I have taken and reduced into, a narrative poem.
And it has a little chorus that can either be sung or spoken.
And it is called Sweet Janine.
Ruben Jones my name, sailor.
. . With the sunlight in her eyes and the wind at her feet she ran that morning, my Sweet Jeanine.
To seek her father's blessing on our love.
To ask, that she might be my bride.
With eyes red rimmed on stumbling feet she came back to the cove that night ... To tell of her father’s anger.
'Better you lie in churchyard than in a common sailors arms.
' Had been his curse on her.
'I'll have him strapped to a capstan bar and round the Indies sent.
' Had been his promise on me.
And so it was in the water whisper of the cove where so often, i had kissed the moonlight from her ha-hair.
I kiss now the bitter salt of tears.
And as upon the rock we clung together for that last time.
I vowed that a year from that night with the fullness of the moon, i would come back to the cove.
I would come back for my Sweet Janine.
On the bark of the Rosie Flores i sailed form the bay at dawn.
And as land faded into haze, it was as though within my sorrow, I could hear her soft voice singing.
I am thine, my love, thou art mine, my love.
Wherever you maybe, may the winds be kind, may the waves be kind.
May they carry you back to me.
I carried the song with me into the western ocean.
Carried it through each setting of the sun.
Carried it through the storms off old Cape Horn.
Now the halls of Frisco Bay had none of me, nor the smoking dens of old Shanghai.
Then west about still... The days and the weeks slid in slowness under the keel.
Until we came at last to the Bisque swells.
And that storm, oh that storm, off Cape Fernandez.
And so it was, at the fullness of the moon a year from our parting I came back to the cove.
Our whispering place, our trysting place.
And there upon the rock she was waiting.
And she was as i remembered her.
Soft in my arms.
Me kissing the tears of joy from her mouth.
All soft, so soft her body to mine.
And there was one, a crone who from the cliff above swore that she had seen it all.
'A huggin’ and a kissin’ they was.
Paid no heed to the tide flowin’ and the water risin’ and me shoutin’ the warnin’ to 'em.
Fool it was.
I could see them plain, i swear.
She was a singin’ to 'im.
'I am thine, my love.
Thou art mine my love.
No more parted shall we be.
For the waves have been kind and the wind has been kind.
And they have carried you back to me.
'Hand in hand,' swore the old crone, 'like a groom with his bride, into the wave they went.
Into the sea they went.
Huggin’ and a smilin’ and a singin’.
''Moment it was, i could see them plain.
' They found the body of my Sweet Jeanine carried back into the cove on the morning tide.
Me... My body lay two fathom deep a thousand mile away, off Cape Fernandez where the Rosie Florez went down that same night.
All hands lost.
Ah, don’t weep for us.
Don’t weep.
For though our bodies lay a thousand mile apart, our souls are forever twined.
And if you happen above the cove at the fullness of the moon... You will hear her singing yet.
My Sweet Janine.
I am thine my love.
Thou art mine my love.
No more parted shall we be.
For the waves have been kind.
And the wind has been kind.
And they have carried you back, to me."
"Let me, tell you about one of my hobbies.
Um, it's synchronised swimming.
Um, it's, it's not a very prominent hobby.
Um, most of the people, especially in Europe, when you sp- speak about synchronised swimming, start by looking you with really wrong eyes.
And saying 'synchronised what.
' Um, and then you have to explain that it's dancing into the water.
And so they have a little picture of it.
Um, most people think this is, half a sport, or, or it's more like a dancing thing.
It is, um, it is very much based on dancing.
But there is, um, a technique which makes it a very strong physical activities, if not a sport.
And, um, it is extremely interesting also to work with, a group of people, in the water and, and to_ people who move differently in the water.
And to work with the_ with them, feel them, learn how to look at them from the side and the corner of your eyes.
Um, learn to be together.
Um, learn_ uh, having the notion of being a group, basically.
Um, some synchronised swimmer dance solos.
But i personally think that it's not as interesting as dancing in a group.
Um, the hardest group you can be, is actually a duet.
Because, uh, as soon as one of the persons is doing something wrong.
It is obviously wrong.
And not synchronised.
Um, i- a, a lot of people, um, wonder as well, um, about my breath and how long i can hold my breath, uh, in the water.
Timing it.
Um, my_ uh, question_ my my answer to this question, is generally that, um, it's not a question of timing.
You have to remain under the water for as long as it is required.
Um, and that means that for training, um, we train always, um, moving, under the water.
Because, most of the time when you performing you're not static under the water.
You're moving.
You're moving your legs out which is very tiring.
Um, you're, swimming to get into your position.
Or, you're carrying someone which is out of the water.
So you're always moving.
Which is a very different exercise than, remaining static, under the water.
Um, the final thing I would like to say about synchronised swimming is that.
Um, for people who are looking at it, it is sometimes, um, a bit boring.
Because they always see different sort of legs going out and things like this.
But they do not always realise that, um, under the water we do very very different things.
And so it's_ sometimes it's really bit frustrating.
And it's also frustra- frustrating to see that the most simple things, which is move- movement at the surface, is sometimes the most, uh, impressive for people who are looking at it.
Um, and, uh, I have to say that it’s a very pleasurable activities and I would recommend it to a lot of people. 			"
"In this country education is set up in a interesting way.
For example in, biology and science.
In science in general, we learn it three times, through our education.
In elementary school when you're smaller it’s simple.
You take the same subject again in high school and it gets a little deeper and more detailed.
When you get into college it’s even further detailed and, and you're responsible to know whole lot more, and to perform a whole lot better.
Now, I went back to college, at the age of forty something, I don’t remember exactly.
Forty...Four, I think.
And I had four children.
One was out of the house married, one was away at college and then I had the two little ones at home.
And they were about six and seven, seven and eight.
And if necessary, many times they would have school holiday when I didn't have a holiday.
Nobody_ colleges don’t give you many holidays you just take them and then you get in trouble.
But, uh, if they were at home and I had to go to school I took them with me.
And they took part in the classroom.
One in particular my little girl must’ve been about six, I guess, maybe seven.
And we were in the music classroom.
And before that she did my music homework with me.
We were supposed to write a simple song, to teach elementary school children.
And she sat with me and wrote the song also, because she was familiar with the piano, as I was.
And, and she had her homework done.
And I didn’t know she brought it to school with her, when I took her to college.
Now the teacher wanted every student to, get up and play their song.
And he was down to the bottom of barrel here, and kids were afraid to get up in their own classroom and play their songs.
So he put on an act saying he was going to cry.
And she couldn’t bear seeing him cry so she said, ""don't cry I'll do it I'll play for you.""  and she got up and she played her song.
And that_ he was very anxious then for me to take her to a teacher immediately, she should have started when she was five years old, she should've started before.
And she got piano lessons for a long time, and almost used it as a career.
But you never get rich by playing piano here.
So that was the end of that part.
Uh, other things that we did.
I took them many times.
I've pictures with them on campus.
A lot of the, students knew them, the teachers knew them.
And they decided to do what I was doing and, and went to college a lot longer than I did.
They're both doctors now.
And so to heck with the piano."
"I used to teach English in Hong Kong.
Um, to, Chinese children, who are extremely cute and_ but very spoiled.
Um, i wasn't qualified to do this.
But, um, i don't think you need much qualifications to teach, um, at this level, at all.
It was, it was fun to start with.
And, i mean it was, it was a way to, to, way to, way to sort of live, and earn a living in, a very expensive, city, like Hong Kong.
Um, basically, i'd, um, design the curriculum.
And, um, um, make, make up s- lots of, lots of, um, drawings and, laminated cards for the children to, to look at.
Because of_ um, images are very important when you teach, um, the children.
So, i have an artistic background which was, um, came in a lot of use.
Uh, and then i've_ obviously you sing a lot, and play games with them.
And it's- it's fun to start with, and it's, it's quite nice.
Um, it was, it was good.
I mean it_ but it was quite hard because, none of the Engli_ none of the, uh, Chinese teachers spoke very good English.
And, who'd_ i did feel a bit sort of se_ isolated, working in, um, a Chinese Kindergarten.
The pay was, pretty damn good.
I can say that.
From coming from England, and, uh, so i, couldn't complain.
But, um, i also taught two adults.
Which, um, used a bit more of my brain.
Hehe.
It was, it was, it was quite interesting to sort of, um, teach individuals and, um, i used to go to the British Counsel Library to, collect my i- information and my resources.
But, um, overall_ no, it was, it was a good way to, survive in Hong Kong."
"Um, since i've come to Oxford.
Um, i've done some teaching.
Um, of undergraduates.
Um, all of this has been entirely in the, the area i was officially doing my, uh, uh, master's degree in, um, which was medieval history.
Um, there's a, a number of, uh, sort of programs on, on which American undergraduates come over to Oxford.
And it was these people rather than, uh, the sort of official, um, sort of ordinary standard Oxford undergraduate that i, i was teaching.
Um, there, there's sort of an awful lot of these opportunities.
Um, there's one program i was teaching for is sort of officially part of the University.
It's called the Oxford Program for Undergraduate Studies.
Um, which is organised by fellows in various colleges.
And, um, the, the colleges themselves, um, sort of financially benefit but don't actually provide the teaching.
And, the, the teaching is sort of organised amongst- mostly amongst postgraduate students.
People who are doing research degrees here.
Um, so it's, it's generally seen as a very good opportunity for young people to get their first experience of teaching.
Um, uh, usually given quite basic courses for people who, who don't have experience in the area already.
Um, i_ the other_ um_ uh, the, the other institution i was doing some teaching for is, um, Stanford University who have a, a centre in Oxford.
It's, it's officially unconnected with the university.
But, um, it's, um, it's an opportunity i suppose for Stanford students to, to see England, and see somewhere other than America and California.
And perhaps also to, um, take courses that, that maybe aren't available in, in Stanford.
Um, i don't know.
So i- i've done some teaching for them as well.
It's, um, it's definitely been a very interesting experience"
"I have four children.
The first two were born in early in the marriage, and the second two came much later.
Uh, right now, right now I think, they're about fifty-one, forty-eight, thirty-eight, and thirty-seven.
The two younger ones I call afterthoughts.
Because they were_ that’s what they were.
I did it this time, comfortably because I had the experience and they had an older brother and sister, that helped me with the tough part.
I arranged baby sitting.
They had it all organized.
I had_ and I had a special night each week for both of the older ones, separately, so that I would spend time only with them.
I would take them out and some of their friends as well.
And spend separate time with them.
And the two little ones turned out to be very sharp cookies.
We had a ball.
They_ we had a lot of fun with them.
They were_ it was a good thing to do.
I, the i, had more time to spend with them because... I made it that way.
And, uh, we had some interesting stories and some interesting pictures of things we did with the younger ones.
We were able to, relax more and spend more money.
Do different things, travel with them.
More than we did with the older ones.
And, uh, my father used to_ thought I was crazy wanting a baby when my youngest was ten.
And I'll never forget getting up there one day after a long trip, and she was driving me crazy in the car.
She had to turn everything on_ on the dashboard, everything in sight had to be touched, tested.
And it’s a_ it's a tough job for me to hold her down, hold her hands down, for over a hour trip.
Then when I got there the first thing I did was handed her to my father.
I said, ""here.
Take her away.""  and he said to me ""ya- you know something.
It was a good idea.""  hehe once he had her in his hands, it was a good idea. "
"This story is called 'The Baker's Daughter'.
And of course it comes from a time when um, we did go to the baker, to get our bread.
And not to the supermarket, as most of us do now.
There was once upon a time, a baker and his daughter.
And the baker did the baking, in the back of the shop, and prepared the dough, and brought it through for the daughter to mould it, and to put it into the oven.
Now his daughter became known as very, very, mean.
Och, whoever walked in the shop would be demanded to place their money on the counter before the daughter would even lift a finger.
Well the, dare i say, fairies, they really liked to be called the little people.
So, it's the little people.
They got to hear of this mean baker's daughter.
And they thought about it and wondered if they could teach her a lesson.
And one fairy decided that she would transform herself, into an old ragged woman of the roads.
And her wand became an old knarled, crooked walking stick.
And on this day, she walked into that mean baker's daughter's shop.
And she shuffled up to the counter, and she said, 'Oo, please missy, please, could you just give me a wee bun.
I'm famished.
' 'Money on the counter first.
' Said the daughter.
'Oh, but please, i haven't got a bean to rub between me fingers.
Just a wee crumb, or else i'll fall down here dead.
' 'Oh, what rubbish.
I want your money first.
Show me the sign of it, and then i'll bake you a bun.
' 'Oh...' And the old woman began to cry, and weep, and moan.
And at last with a great sigh, that mean baker's daughter, turned to the great dough trough, and she took some of the dough.
Just a small handful.
She rolled it between her hands.
She opened the oven door.
Put it in the oven, closed the oven door, and went on with her work.
And, when she thought it was baked, she opened the oven door, and to her surprise, there was not a small roll there, but a loaf.
Oh.
She turned to the- the old woman, 'huh, i'm not giving you that, when you can't put even a coin on the counter.
' And she turned to the dough trough again, and she took an even smaller round of dough, rolled it between her hands, opened the oven door.
Put it in, closed the oven door and went on with her work.
And when she thought that it might have been baked, she opened that oven door.
And to her amazement, there was an enormous loaf there, a double loaf.
Her eyes narrowed, and she looked at the old woman suspiciously, thinking something strange was going on.
Nevertheless, she turned to the dough trough, took a tiny, wee bit of dough, no bigger than your fingernail.
Rolled it between her hands, opened the oven door, put it in the oven door, and closed the oven door, and no sooner had she closed that door, then it burst open again.
And turning, she saw that the whole oven, was filled with this swelling loaf of bread.
At that she became enraged.
She knew that she was being tricked.
She knew that something was wrong.
She became very suspicious, and shaking her boney finger, and hardly able to get the words out.
She turned to that strange old woman, and tried to ask her, just 'who, who, who, who, who, who, who...' And before she could get any more words out, that old woman of the roads, who you remember was really a little person, whipped off her disguise.
Her crooked walking stick turned into a wand, and tapping that mean baker's daughter on the shoulder she said, 'and that's all you'll ever say.
' And the mean baker's daughter was transformed into an owl, flying around, and around, and around the shop crying, 'whoo whoo, whoo whoo, whoo whoo.
' And out through the open door flew the owl.
And away into the woods, beyond.
And now perhaps if you know the saying, the owl was a baker's daughter, you will know where it comes from.
Look up <em>Hamlet</em>, the mad scene, and see what Ophelia says.
It answered my query.
I hope you like that story. 			"
"Into the village came a poor meg- beggar man.
Tired, hungry, and he could smell the smell of fresh baked bed_ bread.
And so he made his way to the baker's shop.
Hesitated in the door step, and then went in.
'Have you any bread to spare.
' 'Well i've sold all the loaves i've made,' said the baker.
'Oh, please, i'm cold, i'm hungry, i've walked many miles.
'Well, the baker looked at him, and he was a poor tired old man.
'All right, i'll make you a loaf special.
' And he put his hand into the tub of flour, and started to take the flour out.
But the baker's daughter was there, and she said, 'ooh, too much, too much.
' And so the baker put a little back.
And still the daughter said, 'too much, it's too much.
' So he put a little bit more back.
But eventually, he had a little loaf, and which he baked specially, for that poor man.
But, when he handed it over, to the beggar man.
He took his real shape, it was our Lord Jesus.
And he said, to the baker's daughter.
'Since you have said nothing, but &quot;too much, too much&quot;, for the rest of your life you will be an owl.
' And so that is how, the owl became_ was a baker's daughter."
"This society... In many places like a company, or industry, or school.
Everywhere is mainly, uh, first developed by men.
And, uh, men developed the system... Relationships, connections among men.
And we call it, uh, um... Men’s network, or boys network.
And, uh, that’s, uh_ well it is very difficult for women to break a boys network in a company.
Because, it is pretty, you know_ uh, connection is pretty tight.
And, uh, w- why, you know, it’s not fair to women, is_ well most important information go through the network, boys network.
And don’t come to women.
And... In this modern society... Information is the power.
In order to have the power, you got to know many things.
And, uh, women’s, uh, movement, uh, in recent years,uh, are trying to crack those, uh, boys networks.
However... I feel it’s not successful at all.
I feel rather women’s movement, gives strength to, connection of, uh, men’s networks hahm.
Because, harassment,hahaha, and, uh, woman’s lib type of moveme- movement, uh, gave men to be more, careful with women.
And, uh, so it’s safer to stay away from women.
Therefore, men goes men again and, uh, men’s network get stronger, and stronger.
And hahaha, woman's movement failed to promote, woman’s position in this regard."
"This is a story which is told anywhere in the British Isles, where they make cheese.
There was once a farmer's wife, who made the most wonderful cheese.
And people came from miles to buy it, and paid good money.
But there was a curator clergyman in that place.
And he used to come, and he expected to be given the cheese as his due.
And the farmer's wife didn't really like that.
And she decided to make for him, a great big cheese, all for himself.
The size of a cartwheel.
Well a cheese like that, it's a long time before it is ripe, and ready to eat.
It must mature.
And he still_ he would come, and he'd ask about the cheese.
And she'd say it wasn't ripe and ready.
And when it was, she'd put it on a cart and she'd take it to him.
But, still he came.
And he used to take out his little penknife, and cut off slices of the cheese.
And the farmer's wife, she didn't like that.
Neither did the cheese.
'I'm not for rich folk, like that.
I could feed a whole poor family,' said the cheese.
'I'm for the needy, not the greedy.
I will travel.
' And she rolled off the shelf and out of the dairy, and into the farmyard.
And there were three great guard dogs there.
And as the cheese rolled past, each took a mouthful.
'Til she was but half the size she had been when she got to the other side.
'Oh, i'm for the needy, not the greedy.
' Said the cheese.
'I will travel.
' And she rolled along the path.
And there was a fox coming.
With a chicken in its mouth.
And, when it saw the cheese it dropped the chicken.
And started to bite at the cheese.
And then, it heard the hounds coming.
So it picked up its chicken and ran off.
And for safety the cheese rolled down the hill, saying, 'i'm for the needy, not the greedy.
I will travel.
' But she fell in amongst a flock of geese.
Who picked at her, and picked at her.
'Til she was but the size of a man's fist.
'Oh, i'm for the needy, not the greedy.
' Said the cheese.
'I will travel.
' And for safety she rolled into a hole, at the base of a tree.
And when it was safe to come out.
She rolled out.
And there in a ditch were three beggars.
Three poor men, who needed her.
And she divided herself into three, and rolled to each of them.
But they were not in truth beggars.
They were angels in disguise.
And they'd seen how this cheese didn't mind being eaten, if it was by someone who had need of her.
And so, they made her again, the size of the cartwheel she'd been.
And took her up with them, into heaven.
Where you can see her to this day, can't you.
Well they say the moon is made of cheese."
"I have a few interesting stories to tell you about my... Youngest son.
He, basically he's the one we have to talk about.
Uh, let's see where do we begin.
Yes, he went to college in, in the city.
We were out, up state, uh, outside of the city, little distance away.
And he would at first_  he was very young when he started.
He was lonesome, and he came home weekends.
And he couldn't wait to start telling me what was going on.
And sometimes if a friend would_ a roommate would leave, and leave furniture, or something, that he thought we could use, he'd bring it home.
And sometimes I was there when he'd come home and sometimes I was not.
Now our house was up tall_ a high ranch you call it.
Up tall, long stair case, and when you open the door the first room you are in is the dining room.
One day I came home from shopping, and I opened the door.
And could barely get the door open, could barely walk in.
Because there was a big chest of drawers from somebody's bedroom set, right in my door way, right in the way.
And I knew very well where it came from.
So as soon as I got my shopping put away, I got on the phone and I said ""young man, what do you intend to do with this.""  I didn't say ""hello"" or who I was ""what do you intend to do with the piece of furniture in my door way.
I don't need it there.""  ""oh it's all right, ma, I understand.""  ""fine, so when are you_ what are you going to do with it and when.""  ""i'll come this weekend and ta_ and get it away.""  he came this weekend, fine.
Now his older brother had an apartment in the basement.
Which was the street level really.
And they decided that he should get this piece of furniture.
I said, ""ok, take it out the front door and go down the steps and right under, the deck is, his front door.""  ""no ma, it's better if we take it down the stair case.""  I said ""okay, you decide, but I want you to take it out the front door.""  they were bigger than me at this point.
I wasn't going to argue too long.
And, I went into the kitchen.
I had my hands in the sink and the younger one comes over, ""ma, do we have a saw.""  ""yes, we have a saw"" ""where is it.""  I told him where it was.
And guess what happened.
They decided to take the chest down basement steps, that had been cut in half with a little landing.
And then continued going back.
And the railing... Was years before the railing was put on.
That railing had to be up about three weeks.
And he got the chest of drawers caught in the railings.
So what he did, he sawed the whole, railing down and got the chest of drawers in.
And then when I wanted to kill him, his father wouldn't let me. "
"This story comes from China.
It's entitled, though stories i think originally, probably didn't have titles.
Who knows who made them up and what they were called originally.
But here, it's called 'A Clever Wife'.
A very long time ago, there lived in the far corner of China, far from the sea, a man called Phut Sing.
He was a good and simple man, but he had a very, very clever wife.
And thank goodness he did.
Because he was always running to her.
'Oh, m- my darling could you please show me how this works.
' 'Look i can't fix that.
' 'Oh, this has got stuck.
' 'Would you have the answer to this problem, i don't know what to do about her, or him, or whatever.
' And always that clever wife seemed to be able to come up with an answer.
Phut Sing was so proud of his wife.
He told all his neighbours, all his friends.
He called her incomparable wisdom, matchless wit, dearest capability.
But still, he wanted the world to know that he had a clever wife.
And he decided to write a big notice, and put it up, outside his house.
Proclaiming the matchless of wit of Phut Sing's wife.
Unfortunately the writing_ the wording read like this.
'A matchless wit like Phut Sing's, does with ease a million things'.
Of course, what he really meant was, 'a matchless wit like Phut Sing's wife'.
But he left out the word 'wife'.
Thinking it was unnecessary, and that people would understand.
Well, the first person to pass, was the local magistrate.
'A matchless wit like Phut Sing's does with ease a million things', he read.
'Huh.
What a, what a braggart.
What a conceited_ what a conceited man, what appalling arrogance.
' And he sent his clerk to summon that man Phut Sing, to his office.
When Phut Sing heard the summons, he was in fear, and trembling, and he went to his wife, 'what on earth am i going to do, what will the magistrate say.
I've not done no- ny- thing wrong.
' 'Ah, don't take any notice,' said his wife.
'Just go along, and see what it's all about.
' When Phut Sing appeared, in front of the magistrate.
The magistrate frowned, 'ha ha, so this is that arrogant fellow, is it.
This is that fellow who can do a thousand clever things with ease, is it.
Well, i'll tell you what, i'll just see whether that is so.
Because, i am going to give you three tasks, and if you can't perform these tasks, huh, then we'll just see how soon the court deals with such swollen heads of yours.
Now listen carefully.
The first task is, you shall weave a cloth as long as this road here, to the sea.
Hmm.
Got it.
Now the second task, you shall raise a pig as big as the mountain behind this town.
And the third task, you shall make as much wine as there is water in the ocean.
'  [Sighing] Phut Sing, went home.
His head was bowed, his feet were heavy.
His wife looked at him, and said, 'well, what did the magistrate say.
' 'Oh, i've got to do these tasks,' and he explained them to his wife.
'I don't know how i'm ever going to do them.
' 'Oh,' said his wife, 'the hardest tasks have always the simplest answers.
Go to bed, and i'll tell you what to do in the morning.
'Well morning came.
Phut Sing has hardly slept a wink, as you could guess.
But his wife presented him with three implements.
The first one was a long ruler.
The second one was a bowl.
And the third one, the third one were balancing scales.
And then she told him, his instructions.
Later that morning found Phut Sing on the road to the magistrate's office.
He knocked carefully on the door, and asked to see the magistrate.
And when the magistrate saw him, 'huh, not you again.
You haven't done the task already, have you.
' 'Oh, oh pardon, your honour,' said Phut Sing, and bowed so low, that his head touched the floor.
'Pardon your honour, but i was just wondering if you would be so kind, as to further instruct me, on these tasks.
I have brought with me a ruler.
A- if you would be so kind as to measure the road from here to the sea, i shall know long a cloth i have to weave.
Um, a- and here is a measuring bowl.
If you would please measure the water, in the ocean, i shall know how many casks of wine to make.
And, here are some balancing scales.
If you could weigh the mountain, then i will know how fat the pig must be, that i have to raise.
'The magistrate frowned, and his piercing eyes looked through Phut Sing.
And Phut Sing trembled with fear.
But then, the magistrate began to giggle.
Th- and laugh.
And roar with laughter.
And at last he realised, that Phut Sing certainly had matchless wit, and he sent him on his way, still laughing."
"The clothes i like to wear are usually comfortable.
I'm not particularly interested in fashion.
I find it changes so quickly, and, personally i think it's a waste of money.
The, fashionable clothes are just so expensive.
And it's not really what i'm interested in.
A lot of nursing jobs i've had in the past, you have to wear a uniform.
Which saves choosing what to put on in the mornings, which is, uh, quite nice.
And the uniform gives you a sense of identity as well.
And usually you get a little bit more respect from the, the clients, and and patients.
But, usually i just wear clothes that are comfortable and, easy to wear."
"There was once a widow, with three daughters.
They were almost grown-up and much of an age.
And the first of them, she said to her mother, 'kill me a cock, and bake me a cake, that I might go on my way.
' Well it was just a form of words.
And this was a poor woman.
She had no cock to kill.
But, she made for her daughter, a cake, really a loaf of bread.
And she said to her daughter, 'you may have half of it, with my blessing.
Or the whole of it with my curse.
' And the girl looked at the cake, and said, 'it's small enough.
I'll take the whole, and risk your curse.
' And she went on her way.
And some time, during that day, she met with a poor old woman, who asked her for food.
And she said, 'i've little enough, and none for the likes of you.
' And went on her way.
And when it was coming to night time, and she must find shelter.
There was a big house.
A big farm house.
And she knocked on the door, and asked for shelter for the night.
And they said, 'you're most welcome.
I will give you a shovel full of silver.
And a spade full of gold, if you'll watch the corpse, of the young man of this house, who has died.
' And she agreed.
And she was put in a room, where the body of the young man lay.
And she was given apples and nuts to eat.
And a cat and dog for company.
And all was well, 'til the midnight hour, when the corpse got to it's feet, and stood before the girl, and said, 'art thou afraid.
' Ha-ha, the girl said nothing, 'art thou afraid.
' And still she said nothing.
'Art thou afraid.
' And still she was silent.
And she was hit on the shoulder, and became a grey flagstone on the ground.
Now, back at home, the second sister.
She would go out into the world.
And asked her mother to kill a cock, and bake a cake.
And as before, the bread was made, and she too was offered, half a loaf, with a blessing, or the whole with a curse.
And she looked at it, and said, 'i will take the whole, and risk your curse.
' And she went on her way, and met an old woman to whom she would give no food.
And as night was drawing nigh.
She came to that same farmhouse, and was offered, as her sister, silver and gold, to watch the corpse, of the young man.
And into the room she was put with a body.
With apples and nuts, and a cat and a dog.
And all was well 'til the midnight hour.
When the corpse of that young man stood before her, and said, 'art thou afraid.
' Nothing was said.
Twice more she was asked, and twice more she said nothing.
And she too hit_ was hit on the shoulder.
And became a grey flagstone on the floor.
And now, it was the youngest's turn.
And as before, a cake was baked.
And she it was, who chose half, with a blessing.
And went on her way.
And you'll not be surprised to know, she met, that same old woman.
And when she was asked for food, perhaps because she was a kind girl.
Or, perhaps because she had her mother's blessing.
She said, 'i have little enough.
But you're welcome to share it.
' And gave the old woman, some of that bread.
And the old woman said, 'i've nothing to give you,'but advice.
Do a_ answer when you're questioned.
Do as you are dared.
And once on the path, don't turn back.
'The girl didn't know what it meant.
But it seemed good enough advice.
And so she went on her way.
And she too came, to the rich farm house.
And was offered a shovel full of silver, and a spade full of gold, to watch the corpse of the young man.
And was put in the room, with a cat and a dog, and apples and nuts.
And she looked at the body, and thought, what a shame it was that he was dead.
For he was a, nice looking young man.
And as before, all was well 'til the midnight hour.
When the corpse stood before her saying, 'art thou afraid.
' And the first time she said nothing.
And then she remembered, 'answer when you're questioned.
' So she said, 'i've Juice the dog, and Pussy the cat.
I've apples to eat, and nuts to crack.
I'm not afraid.
' And she was asked again, and gave the same reply.
'Not afraid to follow me across the quaking bog, through the forest of fire, into the caves of terror.
Up the glass mountain, and down into the sea of death.
' And the girl just said, 'i've been min_ paid to mind you.
I will follow you.
' For she remembered, 'do as you are dared.
' And so that young body, went out of the window, and the girl followed.
And they came to a green hill.
And the young man said, 'open, and let the young corpse through.
' And the girl said, 'and the fair girl too.
' And they were through.
And there they were, at the edge of a quaking bog.
Well, the corpse just seemed to float across the surface.
But, how was a human girl, to cross such a marshy land.
But, there was the old woman, now a young woman.
And she touched the girl's shoes, and they spread.
And she able to cross the bog.
And there, at the entrance to the forest of fire, was the woman again with a damp cloak, to throw about the girl's shoulders, so that she wouldn't burn.
And they were through.
And, by the caves of terror, was a woman with wax, to put in the girls ears, so that she wouldn't hear the screams and torments, of the damned.
Though she saw many evil things.
But at last they were through, and at the foot of the glass mountain.
Again, the young body, just went up.
What was she to do.
But the woman was there again, with honey, to put on the girl's soles, so that she would stick, as up she went.
And when they got to the top, the young corpse turned to her, and said, 'you've come far enough.
Go back, and tell my mother how far you've come.
' But she just said, 'i've been paid to mind you.
And mind you I will.
' For she remembered, 'once on the path, don't turn back.
'And the corpse dived off that mountain, down into the sea of death.
And the girl jumped too.
Down, down, through the green water.
'Til they seemed to be in a meadow.
And she was lying with her head, on that of a young man.
And then she was in a bed, in that same farm house, that she'd been in.
With the corpse, now a young man, alive, bending over her, with his mother.
It seems a witch would have married him.
And since he wouldn't marry one such as that.
He was condemned forever, to be between the sky, and the earth.
Between life and death.
'Til sh_ one should be brave enough to follow.
And now they had.
Well, since this is but a story, you can imagine that she married, that rich young farmer.
Her sisters took their normal form.
And all lived happily, as I hope we may."
"Well, i’m, uh, i’m sure people enjoy themselves wh- when they do drink.
But, haha, the age at which people drink i, i found to be very alarming for me wh- when i got here.
And well perhaps, because i don’t drink, by choice, but... It’s like a_ well, i, i was looking... Expecting to, to see, um, very sober people around me being in, in, in Britain, i mean, i mean the, the former Great Britain.
But, um, it's like almost every street has a pub.
And, uh, i saw one with a sign saying that 'we are open on Sundays,' hehe.
And, i- i- it’s interesting that i mean, sometimes, even on Sunday mornings you find people sitting at the pub.
And they, they drink and they brawl and, uh, i mean i, i spent time, you know, in a university hostel and, when students come back from drinking sprees, sometimes they vandalise stuff around them.
And, uh, uh, i just found that, uh, very alarming for me.
It was different."
"I tend to like quite healthy drinks.
I, like fresh fruit juice.
Especially, orange and pineapple.
And I think apple juice is very refreshing on a hot day.
I like cups of tea in the winter.
Because they're nice and warming and you can curl up with a nice big cup.
But I don't drink coffee.
And I think hot chocolate's nice just for special occasions.
I like, um, wine.
I used to like white wine a lot more.
But as I've grown older I now prefer red wine.
I, don't drink beer.
I find it too bitter.
It's got a very strong taste.
But lager, maybe, that's not so bad.
Um, I tend to drink gin and tonics when I go out.
I don't like fizzy drinks too much.
I don't drink, Coke [Coca-Cola] or lemonade, really, on their own.
But, if they're a mixer with something and I'm out with friends, that's quite a nice drink to have."
"After he's finished school, what I generally do with Zach is, um_ we_ well we always stop off at the sweet shop on the way home from school.
And he'll always ask, for something.
So, I generally do.
Um, we, we get some sweets.
And then on the way home we'll stop off at the Donnington Doorstep Family Drop-in Centre.
This is a place where families can come and just_ simply be.
They can drink tea and talk to each other.
Or, read books.
Um, it's a place where you can take your children, up until the age of about five, to play.
And be safe in the knowledge that nothing bad will happen to them.
Because, it's all fenced off.
There's nothing sharp there.
And it's all pretty entertaining.
Every day they'll make sure that there is something new to do.
Th- there's a play day.
A pastille day.
Um, they, they have sand there.
They have got a, a place where children can run around outside.
Um, they have, have Ling [brand name] pools there.
They have a very good canteen.
And I cook there sometimes, as well.
Which is probably why it's very good.
Um, the sort of_ and I'll cook um, a meat dish and also a vegetarian alternative.
Um, and a pretty good, pudding as well.
Uh, I know quite a lot of people there.
I've been there_ i, I've always, uh, I've been going there from about_ well for the past five years I think.
Um, and it's a damned fine place."
"Okay, my language schools.
So, first, um, when i came to England, in November, i, i spent two months at my aunt's.
And then only i started language school in January.
And, uh, i started at region school.
Uh, i, i had enrolled for, three months, a three month course.
A general English course.
And it was morning and afternoon.
On the whole i had five hours a day, i think.
I'm not_ yeah, i think so.
And, um, now with the benefit of insight i, i would have, you know, just for two weeks.
Or, you know, much, uh, much less.
Because, then if you're happy with the course you can go on.
But, it's quite risky, to enrol for three months, in a row like that.
Um, but_ well i also had a, a good time.
Although i was a bit bored.
You know, it was very inconstant, actually that's, that's what disturbed me most.
Is not so much that i was bor- bored, but it was alway- inconstant.
We had many teachers, and they were always changing.
For lots of, yeah.
And also the students they we als_ always leaving and, an- and coming and leaving.
They stayed for a very short time.
And, week by week we would do, not the same thing, but, the same structure.
Uh, it's not so bad actually, because you can learn if you repeat things.
Uh, i mean we would listen to a radio program.
I- on Monday it_ morning we would listen to the news, the eight o'clock news.
Um, well it was every Monday.
In the end i was a bit_ hehe, a bit fed up with it.
But, um, yeah, on the whole i was quite bored, because, the level was not appropriate for me, i think.
And, i was a bit frustrated really.
And, then i was happy to finish it.
I had a little break in betwee_ in between before, starting a new course in another school, Oxford Language School.
Um, i enrolled for the proficiency course.
Which was only three hours in the morning.
Um, and we had, one teacher for the first one hour and a half, and the second teacher for the rest.
And they were really lovely, both of them.
And, you could see that they were passionate about their profession.
Because they_  yes they, they- they seemed interested, um, interested in- in how we learnt and_ yes and in literature generally about the lang_ English language as well, and, they also knew a few other languages, like Russia_ Russian or French.
Um, so you could see that they are, they were really interested in, in language in general.
And also in teaching i guess.
So, that was much better and_ and in addition, we... Um, i was with, uh, other students who were staying as long as me.
That's just to say, until the exam.
Uh, so, we were solider together.
It was quite good.
Yeah, i enjoyed it."
"In our country, we have all sorts of strange features.
Sometimes man-made.
Sometimes natural.
And, people long ago, thought these were made by giants.
Or by the devil.
And in the north of England, they have what we now know are old quarries.
But they said they were made by the fairies.
And the fairies lived in there.
And if you looked over the quarry edge, and the King of the Fairies saw you, then he'd take you to fairy land.
Now there was once a girl, and she'd heard this all her life.
That there were fairies there, and she must never ever, go near there.
Because if the King of the Fairies saw her, she would disappear.
But she'd got to the sort of age where, she began to realise that, grown-ups sometimes told you things like that, to stop you doing things which were dangerous, and not because they were really true.
And she didn't think there were such things as fairies.
And she was determined, to go and find out.
So one day, taking with her only her dog for company.
She made her way to the fairy hole.
And as they got near, the little dog stopped.
And started whining.
And no matter how much she put him on his lead, and tugged.
Or, however much she shoved him from behind.
He was going no further.
I think he was a little terrier, and they can be very obstinate.
Well, she herself, decided that, perhaps she'd better go down on her tummy.
And crawl along.
And so she did.
And she got right to the edge.
And she looked over, not expecting to see anything.
But no, there was a little town.
And small people moving around.
She couldn't believe it.
And she wriggled back.
And she was sure, that nobody had seen her.
Well, she made her way home.
And she wasn't going to tell, anyone, anything, about that.
But, if you've seen fairies, could you keep it to yourself.
Well, as she sat down to her tea that night.
No, she couldn't keep it to herself.
And she told all her family, about how she'd seen fairies in the fairy hole.
And her father was absolutely horrified.
He was sure that the King of the Fairies would come for her.
What was he going to do about it.
Well, he took the cows and he put them in a pasture far away.
And he shut up all the hens in the hen house.
He stopped the clock.
And he made everyone, go to bed very, very early.
So, if the fairies came, they'd think there was no one there.
But there was one person, he'd forgotten to tell.
He hadn't told the little dog.
And so, when 'round about midnight, was the sound of a tinkle of bri_ fairy bridles, on the fairy horses.
He started to bark, and bark.
And the King of the Fairies knew there were people there.
And he knew the little girl was there.
And he took her.
When the family woke up the following day.
There was no little girl.
What were they going to do.
Y- you can't go down to a police station, and say, 'my little girl's missing.
She's been taken by the fairies.
' Or, can you.
No.
All he could think to do... Was to go and consult the speywife, the wise woman.
So the father went to the speywife.
And that wise woman, she started going on at how m- could he be so stupid as to let his daughter do that.
'We_ e_ yes, that's all very well, but what am i going to do about it.
' 'Ah, well,' she said, 'the King of the Fairies, does like presents.
P'raps if you were to give him some gifts.
Maybe then, he'd let your daughter go.
''Well, y- yes, i'll do anything.
Anything i can afford at least.
What have i got to give him.
' &Quot;well,&quot; she said, 'you could take, a chicken without a bone.
You could take, a light that you don't have to p- put a switch on, or light with a match, or anything like that.
But which you can hold in your hand.
And perhaps, you could take him a piece of animal flesh.
You can get without spilling a single drop of blood.
'Well, he didn't know what this meant.
And wearily, he went home.
Well his wife guessed the answer to the first one, quite quickly.
For it is, of course, an egg.
And they sat, and they thought.
And then, suddenly, someone, i don't know who it was.
Suggested the light could be a glow worm, or a firefly.
'Cause you can put that in your hand.
And it has a little light.
It won't give you much light.
But it_ still it is a light.
Right.
What were they going to do about the piece of animal's, m- flesh you could get without blood.
I mean there're sort of silly things like, killing an animal and draining it of all it's blood.
But then, blood would have been spilt.
And then, the girl's brother remembered, that when he went up onto the heath lands.
Up onto the moors, he could sometimes see lizards basking in the sun.
And if you caught hold of a lizard's tail, it broke off, without spilling a single drop of blood.
That was it.
That was the answer.
So, carefully, the father, he got an egg, and a glow worm, and the tail of a lizard.
That took some doing.
And very carefully, he made his way to the fairy hole.
And he stood at the edge.
Not looking down.
And he put, the three presents, down on the ground.
And in a flash, there was his daughter beside him.
And you may be sure, that she never, ever, went anywhere without telling a grown-up where it was, she was going."
"The foods I like are, quite varied.
Um, I think, food is a wonderful thing and, many people don't make enough of it.
I'm not a vegetarian.
I do like meat.
Um, although not with every meal.
I, tend to like, beef.
I like steak.
Steak and chips, that's good.
Um, but I also like, uh, cuisines from all around the world.
I like French food.
And I like food that's cooked very well with sauces.
And interesting vegetables.
I don't like, dull vegetables like cabbage.
W-, I'll eat them.
But they're not very exciting.
I like... Mixed vegetables and things like stir-fries, where you've got, carrots and sweet corn and interesting tasty things.
I like sweet things very much.
Especially pastries.
But they're too fattening unfortunately.
Anything with sugar, is good.
Um... Fresh cream cakes, gorgeous.
Um, especially if they've got chocolate on top.
I think, when it comes to meals, I tend to like just two courses.
I don't like having a starter 'coz I like to save room for pudding.
Um, soups as starters, I think are, generally quite dull.
I think it's very difficult to make soup that tastes really, worthwhile.
But_ you're taking up the space that you could be leaving for your main course and pudding.
Um, I tend to get upset with people, if I'm cooking.
When I give them the food, and, they automatically add salt and pepper.
I like to think that food should taste good enough without salt and pepper.
I think to be added later."
"One of the best bars in Phnom Penh if you ever, get to go there, is the Foreign Correspondents' Club.
Which was_ oh it was set up, it must've_ i don’t know it was probably some time in the early nineties, or eighties.
To, um_ for all of the press which were going in to report on what’s going on in there.
It does really good gin and tonics for a dollar fifty.
It has a beautiful view out over their_ uh, Tonde Sap joining the Mekong as well.
And a, a, gorgeous old colonial building.
I even heard a rumour that just to get the, um, ambience right, before they put any of the furniture in they lobbed a grenade in there, to make it all look kind of chipped and worn.
Hehe.
Like it had been through something.
But, as you’d expect, yeah, you get lots of journos and so on gathering at the bar.
Filling each other up with stories.
And, i heard from somebody who read an article in Loaded magazine, which is a British lads magazine, British lifestyle magazine, um, how they got their story.
Was_ what had happened these people reckon, was that the, the journalist for Loaded had gone into the bar and asked, somebody about writing a story about expatriates in Phnom Penh.
And he’d had the misfortune to meet a guy called (Zeman).
And (Zeman) filled him up with lies and deviousness.
Which the guy completely swallowed, and went on to print.
And we actually got some copies of this out in Cambodia.
And they went down in storm.
Everybody loved them, and it was a big topic of conversation.
But the only reason we know, like, uh, uh, that this happened, because (Zeman) wouldn’t admit it, hehe.
Apparently_  is that the stories were just so wild and, unbelievable that we could only attribute them to this man (Zeman).
And the gullible reporter from Loaded."
"Um, most of the time the, the approach of the people through a legal system is through, um, legal movies.
Um, or the so called tribunal movies.
Uh, which often pictures, the American system.
Um, and, where you always see someone which_ sometime really poor and having a sort of, 'jus de cause' (just cause) and is arriving in front of a tribunal with his lawyer and, against, a very big company and makes a lot of money out of it.
Or, people often hear about things happening in the United States where, for ridiculous cases, um, some people can get a very, very large amount of damages.
Millions and millions.
Well the French system, um, is very different from it.
And, uh, sometimes people in the street in France are misled by this representation which come from the United States.
The French system first of all does not allow, um, this big, big damages.
Of course you can sue a company or, someone who has damaged your garden or, whatever.
Um, but the, the damages you'll get from it will be, equivalent to the loss you've suffered.
This includes psychological loss.
But, this won't go to millions and millions.
Unless you have suffered millions and millions.
But this happens quite rarely.
Um, as a result, we, we don't have the so called punitive damages.
Um, also if, if, uh, um, a judgement_ an American judgement allowing punitive damages is_ try to be enforced in France.
It won't be enforced in France.
Because it is, against, um, our French legal order.
Um, the reason is that we distinguish between, um, sort of civil punishment and, uh, criminal punishment.
And the, the punitive damages, um, as a sort of criminal corrector.
That we cannot accept in, in_ for civil damages, for civil punishment.
The other thing, um, is that, in the United States, it is basically possible for someone really poor to, have access to justice because, they would get, a lot of damages and, and the lawyers will say that, they would only get paid if, um, the client wins.
And now in France this is different.
Um, we don't have, this.
The lawyers have to be paid.
So as a result, it is either paid by the client, or when the client is not rich enough, it is paid by the state.
Um, in the form of legal aid.
The perverse effect of this, um, is that, um, althou- although legal aid is provided to for very indigent persons.
It is also, um, um, difficult.
Because, most of the time lawyers are appointed by the court on a compulsory way, in cases where they have nothing to gain from, um, apart from, um, a little money.
Uh, which is basically really less than what they would make in normal cases.
And they cannot also win a percentage of what their client is going to make.
So, basically lawyers are really disinterested, in the cases of, legal aid clients.
As a result you will have some people who find themselves into difficult situations.
Um, go to legal aid and are not practically helped.
And are left into difficult situations.
The most critical example i heard of, was when a friend of mine who was a student was fighting against her parents and she had, absolutely no means of living.
Um, and her legal aid lawyer arrived, too late at the tribunal.
As a result, the tribunal, um, decided to postpone the case, of two months.
Now this was a big catastrophe for my friend because she had, no money.
She had nothing to eat.
And, um, yet, she was, she was, um, desperate.
And the answer of her lawyer for this was, 'well, you know don't worry.
You'll eat pastas for the next two months.
' This is the sort of attitudes, um, which i find very shocking in to legal aid lawyers.
And, which unfortunately, um, tends to happen in the French system."
"This is a classic story, and you will recognise it.
It's entitled 'Puddock', which is a Scottish word for a frog.
And you can probably guess now, that the frog, is going to turn into, yes, let's see.
Once upon a time, a young girl was in her cottage with her mother.
They were very poor, as they often are in these folk tales.
And the mother said to her daughter, 'look, we will have nothing to eat tonight unless you go down to the well, and get me some fresh water, to bake some bannocks.
' Bannocks, are the term used in Scotland for buns, or rolls.
So the daughter took her jug, and she went down to the well.
And when she reached the well, she let down the bucket into the well.
But she didn't hear a splash.
And when she pulled it up, there was no water at all.
[Sighing] and she sat down beside the well, and wondered what she would do.
But she knew she had to go home and tell her mother there was no water in the well.
So she started out across the meadows, and as she walked along her tears were dripping down into the long grass.
Suddenly, she heard a voice.
'And what's the matter.
Can I help you.
' She looked around and couldn't see anything.
'No, down here, look.
' And she looked down, and there was an ugly frog, sitting in the middle of the path.
'Oh,' said the young girl.
'Y- yes, I'm upset, because I went to the well, and there's no water.
And if I don't take any water home.
We won't have any supper.
Because my mother can't bake any bannocks.
' 'Oh,' said the frog, 'i think I can help you.
Come back to the well with me.
But, if I get you some water, will you promise to marry me.
' Ha ha, the girl laughed.
'Of course I'll marry you,' she said, thinking what a joke this was.
So they went back to the well, and the frog hopped on the rim of the bucket.
And the girl let it down, and this time, she heard a loud splash.
When she pulled it up again, there was a bucket, full of water.
And she dipped her jug in, until it was full.
And then thanked the frog and said good-bye.
And thought no more about him.
When she reached home, the mother baked the bannocks.
And then she lit the fire.
And they were just about to sit down for their supper, when there was a knock at the door.
'Oh, who's that.
' Said the mother.
'Never mind,' said her daughter, 'i'll go.
' As she opened the door she heard a voice singing.
'Now open the door, my hinny, my heart.
Now open the door, my own true heart.
Remember the promise that you and I made, down in the meadow where we two met.
' 'Oh.
' Said the girl.
Opened the door, and there was the frog.
Who hopped in, and went straight across to the fireplace.
'Oh,' said her mother, 'a dirty slimy frog in here, whatever.
' '[Shush] mother.
' For the frog had started to sing again.
'Now bring me my supper my hinny my heart.
Now bring me my supper, my own true love.
Remember the promise that you and I made, down in the meadow where we two met.
' 'Oh, waste a good bannock, on a frog.
' 'Shhh mother,' said the daughter.
And she went and got a saucer, and broke a little bannock into the saucer, and poured some milk on top, and put it by the frog.
Who ate it up happily.
Then the frog started to sing again.
'Now put me to bed, my hinny, my heart.
Now put to me to bed, my own true heart.
Remember the promise that you and I made, down in the meadow, where we two met.
' 'Oh.
A slimy dirty frog, in your bed.
Whatever next.
' Said the mother.
[Shush] said the daughter.
So the daughter picked up the frog.
And took it over and placed it on her pillow.
Whereupon the frog started to sing again.
'Now give me a kiss, my hinny my heart.
Now give me a kiss, my own true heart.
Remember the promise, that you and I made, down in the meadow where we two met.
' 'Oh, whatever next.
' Said the mother.
But the girl bent down, and kissed the frog, on top of his head.
Whereupon, the frog started to sing again.
'Now bring me an axe, my hinny, my heart.
Now bring me an axe, my own true heart.
Remember the promise that you and I made, down in the meadow where we two met.
' 'Oh.
' Said the mother.
'Something terrible is about to happen.
'But the daughter went outside to the woodshed, she fetched the axe, and she came back, and she stood in front of the frog.
Whereupon, the frog started to sing again.
'Now cut off my head, my hinny, my heart.
Now cut off my head, my own true love.
Remember the promise that you and I made, down in the meadow, where we two met.
' 'Oh,' thought the girl.
She closed her eyes, and lifted the axe high, and brought it down, [whooshing sound] and then it seemed as though a radiance was filling the room.
And hardly daring to uncover her eyes, she heard a voice singing, 'now open your eyes, my hinny, my heart.
Now open your eyes, my own true love.
Remember the promise that you and I made, down in the meadow, where we two met.
' And the girl opened her eyes, and turned around, and saw in front of her, a young, handsome, prince.
And need I tell you, they were married, and lived happily, ever after."
"There was once a teenage girl, who'd been shopping.
And she was walking along the street, and it was raining.
And suddenly, she heard a voice say, 'gi' us a kiss.
' She looked around.
No boys around.
'Go on, gi' us a kiss.
' And she looked down, and there in the gutter was a little frog.
'Go on, gi' us a kiss.
You know i'm a prince really.
''I don't want to kiss a slimy thing like you.
' 'Go on.
' 'No, but i will take you home.
' Because you see, she didn't want him squashed by all the vehicles going along.
So, she picked him up, and she took him home, and she put him in a box.
'Well, you going to gi' us a kiss then.
' 'No, i'm going to go and phone my bres_ best friend.
' So she went to phone her best friend.
Well, most of you will know teenage girls.
So you can imagine it was about an hour or so by the time she came back.
And she looked at the frog.
And the frog said, 'well.
What did she say.
Am i going to get a kiss.
' 'No, we've talked about it very carefully.
And we think a talking frog is much more valuable.' 			"
"There was once a mother.
And she was busy baking.
She was making bannocks, which are a- rather like a loaf of bread, or a scone.
And she ran out of water.
Now, she'd been busy all day.
And you know what it's like, don't you, when someone is very busy, and they're trying to get everything done.
And, she was cross, and she was irritable.
And she called her daughter to her, and said, 'go down to the well and get some water.
' And the girl went.
But, when she got to the well, it was dry.
But her mother'd be so angry, and cross.
She didn't really like to go back without any water.
And she sat, on the edge of the well, and started to cry.
While she'd been sitting there for a few minutes.
The tears coming down her cheeks.
When with a 'plop' there was a little frog, sitting beside her.
Saying, 'why you crying.
' And she sort of looked, and she didn't really take in the fact that the frog had spoken.
She was so upset, she just said, 'u- my mother's baking a- and she sent me for water.
And, there isn't any water in the well.
' 'Well,' said the frog, 'if you marry me.
I'll get you water.
' Huh, she didn't really think, the frog meant it.
So she said, 'yes, of course i'll marry you.
'So he took her jug, and jumped into the well, and came back, with it full of water.
And the girl went home.
And her mother carried on baking.
And then, that evening when they were sitting their sum_ supper.
Why, there came a sound at the door.
And the mother said, 'wh- what's that.
Go and look, daughter.
' And she looked out of the window, by the door.
And there was the frog, singing, 'open the door, my hinny, my heart, open the door my own true love.
Remember the promise that you and i made.
Down in the meadow so green.
''It's only an old frog mother.
' 'Open the door daughter.
' So, she opened the door, and in hopped the frog.
And it hopped, and hopped, across the floor.
And hopped, up onto a stool.
'Give me my supper my hinny, my heart.
Give me my supper, my own true love.
Remember the promise that you and i made.
Down in the meadow so green.
'The girl would have done nothing.
But the mother said, 'make him a bowl of bread and milk.
' And she gave him the bread and milk, and h- he ate it all up.
'Take me to bed my hinny, my heart.
Take me to bed, my own true love.
Remember the promise that you and i made.
Down in the meadow so green.
' And very carefully, she picked up the frog.
Trying not to smell him.
Because he didn't smell very nice.
And she put him on the bed.
'Fetch me an axe, my hinny, my heart.
Fetch me an axe, my own true love.
Remember the promise that you and i made.
Down in the meadow so green.
' And she went to the wood pile.
And she got the axe they used for chopping up the kindling.
And she brought it back.
'Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart.
Chop off my head, my own true love.
Remember the promise that you and i made.
Down in a meadow so green.
' And she raised the axe, and she chopped off his head.
And out came the handsomest prince, you ever have seen.
And, yes, she did marry him."
"This is a Japanese folk tale.
Um, once upon a time, there was a father called Yasokichi and son, Yoichi, and his wife Solmay, lived... In a small village in Japan long long time ago.
And they they were very very hard working, very very conscientious.
So the lord was very very happy... Because they gave the lord lots and lots of food, and um didn't miss any tax payment.
One day, Yoichi's father died.
And he was very very sad.
Yet he worked very hard.
And lord was very happy again.
But lord felt very very_ very very sorry for Yoichi, because he was so um sad about his fathers death.
So one day, the lord called him, called um Yoichi to his um palace, or castle.
And um he told um Yoichi ""Yoichi, you have been ve- working very hard, and I want to give you some reward, anything you want, I'll give it to you.""  Yoichi thinks about a bit, and he goes ""i want to see my father...&Quot; and the lord goes ""okay, you'll see you'll see your father...&Quot; and lord gave him, a box.
And the lord told uh Yoichi that ""yo- you have to put the box_ only you can see it.
Don't show it to any other person.""  so Yoichi was very very happy, and, he took that and hid it to a shed_ hi- hid that in the shed behind his own house.
And ever since then, Yoichi used to go to the shed... Every day, every afternoon, for half hour.
And his wife, Solmay, started to feel strange."" why is my husband going everyday, to the shed.
And coming back.
Shish I wonder what he is doing.""  and one day, Solmay decided to follow him and check on him... So when um Yoichi was working out in the field, Solmay secretly went to the shed, and opened the box... And she thought_ she realized what he has been doing."" yes, he was seeing another woman.""  because she saw in the box a woman's face.
Of course, what the lord had given Yoichi in the box was something that was a rare treasure at that time... A mirror."
"This story is an example of what, um, is sometimes called an urban myth.
Which means it's a, it's a current story.
It is a, it is a story that is being composed today.
It doesn’t always sit easy with traditionalists, but they are good.
And it is called the Gift Fairy.
Marge, now she had led a good life.
She always fed the birds.
She voted Tory, and she visited her son once a week.
It was quite a nice jail.
She always had been kind to her cat and to her late husband, God rest his soul.
She had been faithful to him.
Except with the, plumber... And the coal man.
In fact, Marge was your average salt of the earth senior citizen.
So of course her name went with all the other salt of the earth senior citizens, into the draw for the annual Christmas fairy wishes.
And surprise, surprise... Her name came up on the fairyland computer.
Marge.
So there was Marge on Christmas Eve sitting with her cat, in front of her single bar electric fire in a council flat.
When poof, a flash of light and a puff of smoke.
'Bloody smoke,' said the fairy.
Waving it from her eyes as she stepped out of it.
Now, she was a fairy passed her prime.
Both she and her silver tights, had seen better days.
'Who are you.
' Said Marge.
'Well who do you think i am.
I am the bloody Christmas Fairy, aren’t i.
Come to give you your two wishes.
''Two.
' Said Marge, 'i thought wishes came in threes.
''Not under this bloody government they don’t.
Think yourself lucky you got two dearie.
Now can we get on with it.
I have a date with a gnome.
And gnomes don’t like being kept waiting.
''Well,' pondered Marge.
'Oh yes nearly forgot, no cash prizes.
' Said the fairy.
'Not since the lottery.
' And she stood tapping her wand impatiently against her laddered tights.
'Well.
' Said Marge, brow wrinkled in thought.
And she brightened suddenly.
'You know what i'd really like.
''That is what i am here to find out, dearie.
''Well what i'd really like, is to be young and beautiful again.
''Wouldn’t we all.
' Said the fairy.
'You know,' said Marge, 'like those girls on Bay something.
Baywatch that is it.
Like one of those girls on Baywatch.
''Ooh dearie, i am not sure we can manage that,' said the fairy, eyeing Marge with some doubt.
And she took her mobile phone from the waistband of her tights and dialed a number.
'Listen, i got this old boiler down here who wants to be another Pamela Anderson, can we do that.
We can only do it for a year.
' She turned to Marge.
'They can only do it for a year, dearie.
' She said.
Marge shrugged.
'Well that's better than nothing.
''She’ll go for it.
' The fairy told her mobile phone and then stuck it back in the waistband of her tights.
'Right, hang on.
' She said.
Waved the wand.
Poof, flash of light, puff of smoke.
'Bloody smoke,' muttered the fairy.
And when she had waved it away, there in the chair sat not the saggy, baggy wrinkled Marge.
But the most gorgeous Marge imaginable.
The Marge who leapt to her feet like she hadn’t leapt for forty years to admire her fabulous self in the mirror.
'Is that all me.
' She said.
'No dear, some of it's cellulite.
' Said the fairy.
Not a little jealous of this transformation.
'Now can we have your second wish.
' She said.
Well Marge didn’t know what else she could wish for.
And at that very moment her eyes lit on her old tom cat.
Now that cat had been her only companion for ten long years.
She had loved that cat more than anything else.
She turned to the fairy and simpered, 'could you, could you turn my cat here into, into a handsome young man.
A sort of.... Prince.
''Oh, princes are easy.
' Said the fairy.
'We do princes all the time.
Stand back.
' The fairy screwed her eyes up tight and waved her wand towards the cat.
Poof.
Flash of light, puff of smoke.
'Bloody smoke.
' Said the fairy.
And there, instead of a cat, stood this really hunky young prince beaming at Marge.
With his bright eyes and perfect teeth.
Marge gave a gasp.
'Thomas.
' She cried.
'That's me,' said the cat.
Marge flung her arms about the young man’s neck and planted a kiss upon his mouth.
And they stood there hugging.
'Hmmph, i'm off,' muttered the fairy.
'Some people just can’t wait, can they.
' Poof.
With just an echo of 'bloody smoke' she was gone.
Leaving Marge, in the arms, of a handsome young prince.
Now he was obviously a bit of a poet.
Probably goes with the job.
But he held the luscious Marge and nibbled her ear, he whispered softly into it, 'thank you for making a man of me.
Are you ready for the bedroom i can see.
But i think my dear you are about to regret.
The day you took me to see the vet.'"
"Julian de Morley, would have called himself a Christian soul.
But, deep within him, were the beliefs of his pagan ancestors, not so many years before.
Particularly, the thought that if, something... Someone, was built into the walls of his castle, it would stand the stronger.
And so it was, that he decided that a young girl, a young maiden, of that place, would be built into the walls of his castle.
And everyone said it was wrong.
And the priest said it was wrong.
But, he was the lord of the manor.
And in those days his word, was law.
And it was also the custom in those days_ it was the men of that village, who had to build the castle.
And had to build within it a little room in which the girl could be put.
And the day came.
That dreadful day, when in solemn procession, with much crying, and weeping, and prayers, the girl was brought forth.
And she was given a spindle.
A drop-spindle, and wool.
That she could spin to while away the remainder of her life in this earth.
And she was put into that little room, and the stones were put in place.
And she was left...For one day they heard her crying.
For two days, they heard her crying.
And on the third day, they heard her no more.
And all was quiet, until the anniversary of that dreadful day.
When Julian de Morley lay abed, he heard the sound of crying.
And there standing at the foot of his bed... Was a form.
The form was that young girl.
In one hand her spindle.
And in the other the wool she was spinning.
And she came right to the foot of his bed.
And started passing the spindle from hand, to hand, to hand.
As though she was winding thread, about his feet.
And then she was gone.
And when Julian de Morley woke upon the following day, he had not the use of his feet.
And all was quiet, until another year had passed.
When again the sound of crying was heard, and there was a form of that girl, passing her spindle from hand, to hand, to hand, further up his legs.
And when he awoke on the following day... He had not the use of his legs, and must walk with a stick.
And so it went on, from year to year.
Until the day came, when they found him dead in his bed, as though threads had been wound about his heart.
And that's when the Gytrash appeared.
A ghostly form.
The body was a figure of Julian.
But, it's head was the head of a goat.
And as you walked along the road, it followed you.
And as you ran, it ran, for it had got in front of you.
Then you were dead.
And don't think they'd seen the last of that girl.
No... On each anniversary, there she was again.
Her victims now, the girls of that neighbourhood, who were alive, as she was dead.
The people were in despair.
What were they to do.
Oh, the priests prayed, u- to no avail.
All the wise women, with all their knowledge, and all their herbs, tried what they could.
But nothing, could stop those two spirits.
And then they went to the speywife.
The wise women of Farthingales, nearby.
And she said, 'tain to t'other.
' And they couldn't think at first, what she meant.
And then the Earls of the villages talked amongst themselves.
And they thought, 'she means to set one spirit, against the other.
' But how are they to do that.
Again, they went back to Farthingales, to the wise woman, the speywife.
And said, 'what, what are we to  do if we are to set one against the other.
' 'Ah,' she said.
'A Gytrash it is seen most often when there is a burial, is it not.
' And they agreed it was so.
When someone was laid to rest, after their death.
Why then, yes, they saw the Gytrash.
All right she said, 'you must make a form, like the form of a Christian child.
And give it burial, as though it were so... In the killing pits outside the village.
And you must lay a trail of honey, from the castle, down to the killing pits.
And the maiden, that girl, will follow the trail of honey.
'And so, with the last sheaf of the harvest, they made a form like a baby.
And as though it was a dead baby, they took it, to a grave they had dug in the killing pits.
And hid themselves nearby.
And then there was the Gytrash, above the ground, and below the ground.
And then, coming down the trail, that they'd laid with honey, down to that grave, came the spinning girl.
And she stood by the grave, passing her spindle from hand, to hand, to hand.
And she walked the length of that grave.
And then she looked to where they were hiding, as though she knew they were there, and vanished.
And they say, that the good folk of Gothland, in the county of Yorkshire, have not seen either the spinning girl, or the Gytrash, from that day, until this.
And that's where i used to end my story.
But, last year, i met a man, who spent his childhood, in the farm where the speywife of Farthingale's had lived."
"Four years ago, when i came to this city, i had to gain work.
Work didn't come readily, from the applications that i put in.
When people did ask me for interviews.
And gave me jobs, i ended up with four.
I pieced them together, to the extent that i had a very full, working week.
I would start at the stationers, early morning, about half past seven.
Well, it had to be half past seven, i had to get there on time, if i could.
Then i would work through to midday, and i would be, um, filling up shelves with items that, had been bought the day before.
Having looked at sheets detailing this information.
I would also make sure everything was, um, going to be coming into the store, so that i could fill up the next day too.
And help people where i could.
Then i would fly across town.
I might have some time to look into shops, or go to a gallery or, see friends.
Then i would have to be at the supermarket, around half past twelve.
And i would go and sit on a check-out, and take people's money for the shopping that they put onto the belt, and i would scan.
I would make a lot of friends doing this job.
And i would enjoy learning about where the products came from.
And where they were kept in the store, and gaining a knowledge of where they might be, if people hadn't managed to find them, before they came to me, so that i could get them for them.
Then, i would, carry on working 'til the late evening, about ten o'clock.
We might end up finishing earlier, if not enough things, had been bought the day before.
I would be filling up the shelves again with items, much as i'd done in the morning, early that day.
We would have tea, we would have a supper break before the tea, and i would thoroughly enjoy my meal.
Then at tea break later_ about eight o'clock we'd all have a chance to get to know one another.
Ten minutes would be the time, that we would spend, in the canteen, having a break from work.
Then we would go back downstairs.
We might find it cold, whereby we had stopped working.
We would keep filling up, and then we would set about, making sure that everything looked straight, and neat and tidy, and that it was very nice to look at, for people to come in and find things the next day.
And then, at ten o'clock, all being well, we were free to go home, having clocked out in the clocking-in machine, and clocking-out machine.
And we would make our various ways home.
I would go on a train.
I would feel very tired at the end of such a long day.
All sorts of things would come into my mind.
But i would eventually get home.
I would'v- would have enjoyed the train trip.
And i would get home, and i would try to make sure that i could get ready, the things for the next day quickly.
Have a bath, and finally retire into bed.
Very tired, very likely to fall asleep straight away."
"This story comes from Armenia, and it's called 'The Liar'.
Once upon a time there was a king of Armenia.
And he was be_ he was a rather curious man.
And he used to get very, very bored too.
And he thought, 'well, what sort of sport, or pastime can I dream up now.
' 'Cos being pretty wealthy, he had everything that he wanted.
And at last he thought 'right.
I would like to meet the most outrageous liar, in my land.
I'm sure there are plenty around, but let's see.
' So he sent out his heralds.
Marching far and wide across his land.
Proclaiming that the king was willing to give a whole apple_ an apple made of gold, for the most outrageous liar in the land.
Well of course, soon they were queuing up at the gate, weren't they.
Every type of liar.
Well you'd be surprised.
Butchers, bakers, candlestick makers.
There were wealthy men, there were poor men.
There was the b_ housewife, there was the banker, there was the butcher, n- the lot.
But the king wasn't very impressed.
I mean, ha, he was a bit sad to find out how many liars he did have in his land.
But, none of them seemed to be able to tell just that outrageous lie.
Well, he got a bit tired of this.
Got a bit sad, and didn't want to know about it any more.
And he'd almost forgotten about it, when a knock, came at the door.
And there was an old beggar there.
And the beggar went on, demanding, and demanding of his servants, to be admitted.
He said he must see the king, he had something very important to tell him.
Well at last he was admitted, and he came before the king.
And the king looked him up and down, and thought he wasn't much of a chap, but, you know, what did he want.
'Oh,' said the beggar man, um 'i've come, I've come to, um, get what you owe me.
' 'Oh, what d'you mean, what I owe you.
' 'Well, you you owe me a pot of gold, don't you remember.
' 'A pot of gold.
I don't re_ I never owed you a pot of gold you, b_ old beggar you.
' 'Look you made me a promise, you owe me a pot of gold.
Don't you remember.
' 'Oh, that's a lie,' he said, 'a lie, you are the most outrageous liar, I've ever heard.
' 'Oh,' said the old beggar man, 'i'm the most outrageous liar you've ever heard, are you.
Well, can I have my apple, made of gold.
' 'Uh, bu_ uh, bu_' the king was speechless.
And of course the apple of gold was duly awarded."
"I like, um_  i’d like to be a doctor one day.
'Cause i’ve met so many, nice people.
And I can see why it’s such an attractive job.
'Cause there's money, I mean, the fact that you will be paid and you’ll have a wicked pension.
And everything is gonna be sweet after you_ you’re stressed.
Hehe.
You’re gonna have a very stressful job and that.
But the job is, is so much better than the wage.
And the wage is huge.
So... It’s definitely a good job to get into.
I mean_ I met this bloke at a bus stop whilst I was trying to go, to a friend’s house.
And I ended up talking to him for half an hour.
'Cause he had saved, twenty people in one night in Chicago in n_ on New Year’s.
He gave up his New Year’s to save twenty people from, alone, twenty people alone, from stabbings.
From knife attacks.
And he s_ he managed to save twenty people.
And I just, i’ve got a lot of respect for someone who’s, who can do that.
Um, i’ve got another friend who gave up_ he was at a party and knew first aid, knew chiropractice, chiropracty.
And he can like sort out all your joints and everything.
And he, he can make you stand straight just by touching you.
Which is a, nice skill to have.
To be able to do that with your hands.
I mean it’s not, like writing is it.
Anyone can write, but can you heal someone.
Can you set a broken bone with your hands.
Can you remove pain.
Can you remove stress.
Can you, make people’s lives happier just with your hands.
I mean fair enough, it does take five, seven, seven plus years to, to know about humans and, also animals.
Cause you do this on animals as well.
And you can like_ a horse breaks it’s leg that’s worth a few million pounds.
I’d, I'd rather have a chiropractor be paid fifty pounds or, probably quite a lot more than that.
To fix this broken, this broken leg on this thoroughbred.
Than to have it shot gunned through the head.
Because, I mean, it didn’t cost us anything, did it.
Apart from the years that this person will have to have spent gaining this knowledge.
But, it’s pretty interesting to learn about your own body and other people’s bodies.
So I mean you can’t really complain.
Doctors are, I don't think i’ll ever be able to be one.
They're just too god damned cool.
You can_ I mean it’s like stress.
Have you ever seen ER [popular television program].
Have you ever se_ there are loads of doctor shows, aren’t there.
There are loads of them.
They’re like_ and you see all these doctors stressing and, having heart attacks.
Maybe they just try and save too many people.
And, uh, you, you have to be really lucky to be a doctor.
You’ve got to have a good_ got to have a good mind.
You can be this kind of doctor.
You can be a doctor of physics.
Or a doctor of philosophy.
But I mean i’m talking about, i’m talking about saving people’s lives.
And that has got to be like one of the most nec_  probably like, closest a bloke could ever get to giving birth.
Do you know what I mean.
It’s got a be very fulfilling thing."
"Well, uh... I like almost all music.
As long as, uh, i feel, uh, comfortable and, uh, makes it, uh, ah... I don’t know, uh, soothing my emotions and, feelings and, uh, my psychology.
So that i can take it, uh_ any music indeed.
And if you say, uh, &quot;okay Mozart&quot; i like Mozart very much.
Especially his, uh, violin, uh, concerto.
And, uh, i like (xx) because that sound is very good.
It’s soothing.
And, uh, i like opera too.
But i don’t like, you know, opera, uh, opera singer who_ whose voice is not so good.
Hehe, as long as their voice, uh, attract me i keep listening, uh, opera.
I like it.
And reason_ uh, okay, the reason is more likely, i feel like i want to sing too.
So usually i start singing a voice to_ funny, funny squeaking squeaky voice.
And by singing loud with, uh, out of tune... That makes me so happy too.
Hahaha.
But, well... And, uh, also i started liking, uh, sort of a combination of modern music, and classic music.
And, uh, like, uh, recently, i bought C-D, uh, called Romanza.
And, uh, Andrea Bocelli is singing there, with, uh, also very famous po- pop music_ musician... And, uh, i don't know some reasons, that combination really attracted me.
And, uh... Deep beautiful voice Andrea, uh, has, and, uh, other famous pop music- musician, i forgot, Mills or something... His voice is kind of, you know, squeaky and not much volume.
But funny way tingling our, sensation, physiology.
And i don’t know why, but, uh, when it comes together with Bocelli's beautiful voice, together.
I just felt ecstatic hahm."
"So, for myself i've played, the piano and the violin.
I started the piano when i was nine.
And again, it was my parents, who suggested i should play, uh, an instrument, if i wanted.
Of course, i wasn't, um, obliged to.
But, uh, it was one of the things in the family that was quite good, because... They have_ uh, um, as my father suggested that i would_ that i should, uh, um, go horse riding_ um, suggested me to play some music.
And, i think it's also because he enjoys playing music.
He's_ he plays the drum.
He plays the clarinet, and the flute, the recorder, and the piccolo.
He doesn't really practice it very regularly.
But, he, he enjoys it, that's for sure.
And so, a_ all of us in the family we, we, we play some music.
My older sister, actually she stopped, but she used to play the clarinet and she started the guitar.
And, now i think she's, she's about to start again.
And she might, start the cello.
My younger sister, she played the recorder for many years.
And, she started the cello, ya_ last year.
And my younger brother, as well, he, he plays the recorder.
So we_ and then the house is full of music.
And when one is... Practising the other one can't and is grumbling.
And you know, you have to, to make_ almost make a timetable, for everybody to play.
And sometimes, because my piano is in the living room and was the_ when the, the T-V's on it's quite difficult, to play.
You have to_ to agree really.
Ha-ha.
So, one_ once i'm_ i wanted to have a piano in my room.
But my because my room is, quite small it wasn't possible.
But i'm glad i didn't do that.
Haha, because, yeah, yo_ you need, you need it to be some_ somewhere else.
And it's_ i think i enjoy playing for other people as well.
I think that's one of my motives for playing, music.
I like people listening to it, enjoying as well.
Uh, as much as me if possible.
And, it's hard to say why i enjoy music, i don't know.
It's just like, um... When you're, told a story, or when you tell a story, because it's also active, playing music.
Active, although you don't compose the music i mean, but you play it.
Sometimes i improvise but, not so often.
I mean, hm_ and i realise that it- it's very important, because now that i'm, um, in England, i've been meaning to_ in my room i have no, um, tape-recorder or whatever.
Not in my room we have some in the living room and so on.
I need it in my room actually.
So, i mean_ because it's something you need in your intimacy, or, just for yourself.
Sometimes you can't play it in the living-room, because there are other people and, you might disturb them.
So, i really need something for myself.
And, uh, that's one of the thing, the things why, i'm looking forward to going home.
Just little_ details like that makes you happy to go home again."
"Before i came to Oxford i worked for the Order of Carmelites for a year.
First of all in Kent.
And then, up in the north at Hazlewood Castle which is between Leeds and York.
Um, i first was at, um, Aylesford Priory, which was their original mother house for_ in twelve hundred and forty-two.
Because the Order of Carmelites are very interesting order, i think.
Because they originate from, a group of hermits who lived around Mount Carmel in Palestine.
And, they, looked to their origins to the Old Testament and their spiritual founding father.
They looked to Elijah to his successor Elisha.
The two prophets Elijah and Elisha.
And in actual fact their crest has, um, three stars on it.
And two represent the prophets Elijah and Elisha, and the third, represents the Blessed Virgin Mary.
And there’s like a mountain, there which is Mount Carmel.
And, they always ca_ they called themselves in Palestine the, Brothers of Our, Lady of Mount Carmel or the Blessed Virgin of Mount Carmel.
And, um, they very much looked to, some of the Eastern traditions.
Because when they came, at the time of the Crusades and, um, the Sarassin invasion they, came to this country and they brought some of the more Eastern traditions, particularly regarding Mary.
And the very first church in this country, to be dedicated to the Assumption was the priory at Aylesford.
And when they came to this country, and Europe.
They then had to adapt their lifestyle from being hermits to, friars.
And they became Mendicant friars.
And, um, Aylesford was their original house.
And it’s, become now today, uh, a thriving retreat center, and place of pilgrimage.
And there’s still many of the old medieval buildings still there.
There’s also, um, a very modern part of the shrine and guesthouse as well.
And there’s some wonderful artwork.
Which, um, had first been done about fifty years ago by, the Polish artist Adam Kossowski.
Who had been a prisoner of war, and had vowed that if he escaped he would, um, dedicate his art to the church.
And when fifty years ago, um, Father Malachi Lynch_ it’s thirty_ fifty years this year.
Because it’s being celebrated, um, later in the year.
The anniversary.
But, um, he was a Carmelite who lived in Ireland.
But he had this vision of reviving the ancient home of the Carmelites at Aylesford.
And, um, which had been destroyed at the Reformation and passed through various secular hands.
And he, um, in nineteen forty-nine brought this group of Carmelites over to, Aylesford.
And set about the work of reconstructing it.
He was a very charismatic figure and engaged a lot of artists and craftsmen, from this country, from Italy and all over.
And including Adam Kassowski who, um, did many of these, um, wonderful ceramics that are in the various chapels around the shrine.
Because Father Malachi had this vis- vision of establishing a shrine there, dedicated to Mary.
But he said that you didn’t need an apparition to make a shrine.
Which i think is one of the things that’s always appealed to be about, Aylesford.
Because i’m not really a person who’s into loads of apparitions.
But, it was a place of prayer and, um, dedication to Mary as the mother of Go- of Jesus.
But, um, and her place as, um, leading um, people to Christ her son.
So that was an interesting place to work.
And also then at Hazlewood Castle which was, an old recusant Catholic home.
And had been in the hands of the Vavasours family since Norman times.
And so that was another old historical building to be working in.
Um, and as i say it’s, uh, based between Leeds and York.
And that was another retreat centre.
Unfortunately last year they had to sell it and it’s now actually become a hotel.
But the old chapel which goes back, right to_ parts of it go back to Norman times.
And has the tombs of the Va_ Vavasours family there.
Um, that is allowed to be used about once a month.
Um, but i think it’s rather a shame that it’s, uh, become a hotel because it was a fascinating place with lovely grounds.
And, there, there were also, um, some Carmelites here in Oxford.
But they’re actually, um, a different branch of the same family, you could say.
They’re the, Discalced Carmelites.
Um, who after the Reformation there was, um, sort of a new branch of Carmelites, was, um, established.
Originally it hadn’t really been e- e- envisaged that there would be a separate order.
But they broke away like so many orders sort of have differences and the_ and nowadays they are trying to move closer together.
&Lt/;P>  anyway the Discalced priory here in Oxford is situated in a beautiful area called Boars Hill.
Which on a very clear day i can see from my roof terrace.
So i always joke and say, 'ah i’m looking towards Carmel,' as some people might look towards Mecca.
Um, and that is set in beautiful grounds in this National Trust property of Boars Hill and, um, because of the Carmelites, um, tradition of looking towards the Old Testament and, uh, honouring the prophets Elijah and Elisha.
And particularly Elijah.
Because they actually have a feast day of Elijah.
Both Order of Carmelites, and the Discalced Carmelites, celebrate this feast day on the twentieth of July.
Um, a lot of, ah, Jewish people are quite attracted to the Carmelites.
And they often have, both branches of the family.
It’s always known as a family of Carmel.
Um, have, uh, Jewish/Christian weekends and study days.
And in fact a very well known Jewish rabbi, who is well known for his cooking often_ um, recipes_ often does, um, retreat up to Boars Hill for a, a day or two.
Enjoying the community and reciting the Psalms."
"There was once a farmer in Oxfordshire, who needed a lad to work on the farm.
Well, it was a custom in those days.
To go to the nearest town, to a fair, where the men stood around waiting to be hired.
So he took himself to the nearest town.
To the hiring fair.
But there he was faced with a whole row of young boys.
Which was he to choose.
He decided to a- ask of each of them a question.
'Why should i hire you.
' Well you know young fellows, young boys.
Most of them, just sort of laughed.
Or hung their heads.
And, one or two of them said, 'because i'm a good worker, master.
' As they'd been taught.
But one, he seemed to have his wits about him.
And he said, 'why, i'm never hungry, i'm never thirsty, i'm never tired.
' And the farmer thought, not only did he appear to have some brains.
But, it would save him some money to hire one like that.
So he hired him.
Now, it was true the boy went to bed ere the sunset.
But, given drink he drank as much as the next man.
And when the farmer saw him not, for the first time, having thirds, of the good wife's cooking.
He said, 'i thought you were never hungry.
You were never thirsty, you were never tired.
' 'Aye, that's right master.
For i eats before i'm hungry.
Drinks before i'm thirsty, and go to bed before i'm tired.'"
"I’ve been brought up in France where we have a big welfare state.
Um, and where there is, a big conscience of, abuse possible by capitalism's, and of contra balancing by the state.
Um, and also where, a lot of corruption, corruption cases have made people aware of, the risk, um, that, that there is for a government.
Um, when it is surrounded by big firms.
At the moment there is a particularly good example of such abuses.
Um, it relates to genetically modified organisms.
Genetically modified organisms are basically, let’s say seeds or.
. .  Whatever sort or organism, living organism, which D-N-A has been modified, um, for a certain purpose.
There is not only, like, crossing vegetables.
Um, which makes a, a sort of D-N-A modification.
But it’s, it’s more dangerous in a sense that, the D-N-A modification will allow the plant to produce, um, it- its, its own insecticides and this sort of things.
Bas- basically make it_ of this plant a super plant.
Now the advantage of this obviously is that, hehe, it’s obviously an advantage for agriculture.
Um, you don’t have to put insecticides on it.
You don’t have to, um, y- you are um, sure to have a good crop.
These sort of things.
The problem is that, there is a lot of risks involved.
There is risk for the environment.
Um, and a lot of people, are saying that maybe this_ the seed through pollenizations, um, could go to other plants and create super weeds.
That we could not get rid of because... They’re too powerful.
And we don’t_ we wouldn’t have, um, enough, enough, uh, insecticides or enough pesticides to get rid of it.
The second risk is the human he_ the human health risk.
Because we don’t know, um, whether this new sort of D-N-A.
Whether this new, proteins that are being created and introduced in our food, um, are basically going to be_ to have effect on us.
Maybe, um, you know have effect on cancer and this kind of things.
And so, people are more and more careful about it.
They’re also more careful_ and, and, people worry about it.
They also worry about it because, of the whole, uh, mad cow crisis, and mad cow, mad cow disease.
And people feel that they want some security.
They don’t trust the food industry into securing them that everything is okay.
They want the government to intervene.
They want to be sure that what they’re eating is safe.
Now the big firms, of course, have, um, a limited interest in ensuring that, um, their their G-M-O food, um, is safe.
They have an interest because they don’t people to die.
Um, but this interest is limited.
Because, uh, it could mean that they have to change their whole policy.
And they have to change_ or they have to make more research.
And therefore have to spend more money.
Um, and you find at the top of, of this, there are the, the big G-M-O firms which are generally American firms.
These firms, um_ very, very powerful.
And they are very powerful lobbies.
They, they’re lobbying the American government, um, so that the American government is basically, um, torpedoing all the conventions on the subject.
Or the conventions, that would, um, allow the governments to control the entrance of G-M-O into their countries.
Um, this would be contrary to, um, the W-H-O agreements.
But it could be overcome by conventions.
And now the Americans are always torpedoing these conventions.
Because they’re lobbying by these big firms.
The other thing that these big firms tend to do is they tend to sue anyone who speaks about them, in a bit of, um, of a too, uh, assertive way or a too criticising way.
So that it’s a, it’s a very convenient way of, uh, preventing people to, to speak.
Because, having a lawsuit, um, is very difficult financially to bear.
And especially against these firms who have the financial means to, have lawsuits.
Um, and finally these, these firms, um, are trying basically to have the control over the production, um, and the agriculture.
And they’re doing it in several ways.
They are basically, um, forcing farmers to buy their seeds, um, every season.
And they’re suing the farmers if the farmers are reusing the seeds.
The second means they’re using is through, um, changing D-N-A.
They are basically, um, are making the seeds unavailable for a second crop.
So this shows again the danger of such firms that would, basically control the food productions.
And, it, it is a demonstration that the government should be really, really careful about it.
Um, now of course these firms, are lobbying the governments because, they want to be free to do what they want.
Um, where_ and, and it’s, it’s, it’s shown, especially with the, American government, that they can arrive to their means.
And i think that this is a very good example of abuses, by these firms of their own economic power.
That we should be really, really careful about it."
"There was once a couple.
And they were travelling from island to island.
And, as was the custom in those days.
They were travelling, on a local fishing boat.
Now, the husband, and the skipper of that boat.
The captain, they started talking, and drinking whiskey.
And, at one point, the captain said, 'i have never met a virtuous woman.
' And the husband was horrified.
After all, the captain had met his wife, hadn't he.
But, the skipper, he stuck to his story.
'There is no woman in the world, i cannot seduce in three hours.
'Well, as i said, much whiskey had been drunk.
And a wager, a bet was laid.
If the captain was right, he would get the husband's prize possession.
And not his wife, his fiddle.
If the husband was right, why, he'd get half of the catch of the fishing boat.
Now, i don't know why, the fiddler's wife agreed when this was put to her.
Perhaps the captain really was, rather a good looking fellow, or something about him.
Anyway, she agreed.
An hour passed.
The husband was getting worried.
Two hours passed, and his wife was still not back.
So he took his fiddle, and went back up on deck.
And started it_ playing it, saying, 'for two long hours, he's had you in his powers.
The catch will soon be ours.
' But, from the captain's cabin, came the sound of his wife, saying, 'too late, too late, my dear he has me round the fiddle middle.
Too late, too late, my dear, you've lost your damned old fiddle.'"
"This this story is one from the North American Indian tradition.
And it is a story that tells us the importance in our lives of story telling.
And is called the Story Fire.
When Jiawa the great Spirit created the universe and all living things he gave to each of those living things a story to tell.
Yes every creature, every mountain, every river, every had its own story.
And as keeper of those stories the great Spirit appointed a wise woman called Sajako and it was Sajako who lit the story fire.
A fire around which every living thing could gather to tell its own story.
And it was Sajako who would remember those stories and take them out into the world and tell them to others who would tell them to others, who would tell them to others.
And so it was that every living thing in the world knew the story of every other living thing.
Because of that they were able to live in great harmony.
Until man set out to conquer the earth and to rule over all others.
Until man, began to tear up the prairies and pollute the rivers and the sea.
Until man began to foul the forests and tear the heart out of the mountains.
And as he made a wasteland of the earth so his own life became a waste land full of things, full of hurry, full of greed.
And in that waste land people no longer listened to the voice of Sajako.
They had no time for the stories.
They laughed and called them foolish.
Only a few of the old ones remembered, but they were called foolish too.
No one listened to the stories.
So the stories withered and began to die.
Without their stories being told eagle and buffalo and coyote and bear, they no longer gathered around the story fire.
Story circle was broken.
Fire dwindled.
Without its story being told the rains ceased to fall.
Grass no longer grew.
The wind stopped blowing across the prairies.
And when the people saw this they were afraid.
They feared that when the sun no longer heard its story being told it would no longer bring the day.
They feared that when the last story was forgotten the earth itself would die.
But Sajako had not forgotten the stories.
Little by little people began to listen for her voice very deep in their hearts.
First it came in dreams and then little by little stories came back and people began to pass them on.
First to their children and then to each other.
And when rain heard its story being told it began to fall again.
When grass heard it story being told, it grew green and tall.
And the wind heard its story being told it sent little breezes running back across the prairies to tell the people, 'I am back.
' And one by one as they heard their own stories again the birds and the beasts and the spirits of the trees and the rivers and the rocks and of all living things gathered once more around the story fire to tell their tales again and to tend the story fire even more lovingly for having been away.
Now perhaps as we listen once more to each others stories, the world again will learn to live in peace and harmony. "
"My first career position, was in Asheville, North Carolina.
And, uh, I moved to Asheville when, um,  I was in my early twenties.
And, my first position there was with a chamber of commerce.
Which is like a business league.
And Asheville, North Carolina, is in the western part of the state.
And it sits in the Great Smoky Mountains.
And it is an absolutely beautiful location.
And, one of the things that, um, I was asked to do when I was there was, Asheville, as beautiful of a city it is, surrounded by the mountains.
Had an inferiority complex as a community.
And you would just see this, this beautiful community.
And you couldn't imagine why in the world a, a city that was so beautiful.
Surrounded by these Blue Ridge Mountains and Great Smoky Mountains and Pisca National Forest sitting on a Plateau.
Had an inferiority complex.
And it seemed at that time in the seventies that, um, many of the communities that it was competing with for business.
Especially for tourism, um, had discovered air conditioning.
So people did not have to go to the mountains any longer to cool off in the summer months.
And they found themselves competing with Atlanta, and Miami, and other Florida_state of Florida destinations.
So it was, um, it was kind of interesting to me.
So my challenge was to position, this beautiful mountain city of Asheville in a national marketplace.
So, in order to do that, I of course had to do my homework, and find out what was unique about Ashville, other than its physical location.
And it turned out that it had a, uh, uh, very rich history of Scottish and English, uh, settlers who settled in the mountains.
And they had, uh, brought their traditions with them.
Of the dancing, the folk music and the folk dancing.
And, there were fiddlers, which are of course are violinists who just sort of pick at the fiddle.
And guitar players and banjo and mandolin players.
And they had, again, this wo-wonderful music.
And there were artisans who did crafts by hand.
Whether they were um  the, the bowls, you know, making bowls from clay or glass blowing or things like that.
And it seemed like there were_ all these artisans and this rich talent of, uh, music, uh, uh, performers and dancers.
And it was just sort of, swept under the carpet.
So I was very fortunate in those early days that, um, I suggested that we sweep_ we get it out and lift up that carpet and sweep off all of that history of that area.
And package it, uh, into a nice package for marketing purposes.
And, um, rather than competing with Atlanta, and some of the other larger cities.
That it should look at its own personality, and perhaps position itself against other mountain resort areas.
Um, in the, in the Colorado Mountains or in, the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia.
And that, that was more of its competition.
It would never be a huge metropolitan city like, uh, a New York City or Washington D-C, or anything like that.
So my thoughts at the time were that, everything that was natural and innate to that area, was what we should be promoting and packaging.
And an interesting thing happened when we did that.
It just created a tremendous sense of pride in the community.
And all of a sudden this community that had this terrible inferiority complex, found itself reborn.
With a new sense of pride and enthusiasm for who they were.
And, um, so that was pretty much my first challenge in Ashville, North Carolina.
And, uh, it turned out to be one of my very favorite cities.
Uh, the people there are very warm and accepting.
And they had very, um, very good business sense about them.
And of course they were very thrifty, being with that, uh, Scottish heritage that they had.
And, um, so they were just wonderful people, uh, to work with.
And to get to know.
And, uh, and again they just felt so_ uh, the pride that they felt from this approach and, just looking at who they are.
And being proud of who they are and their heritage.
And it turned out to be a magnificent success, uh, and a marketing story for business purposes."
"A hot new piece of news to follow in Asia right now, is the battle between the_ over who’s gonna have the tallest building in the world.
Uh, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia a few years back built the, um, the Petronas Towers.
Which are two towers linked by a bridge.
And they are the tallest, they are they_well it is the tallest building in the world, right now.
But in Bangkok they’ve been trying to exceed that with a tower they called the Baiyoke tower.
But both of these things have been rather hastily built.
And in Kuala Lumpur, hehe, nobody really wants to live underneath this tower.
And the people are actually moving out of that immediate area, i’m led to believe.
In Bangkok they were really, really close to finishing this tower, the Baiyoke Tower, which, is going to be about the same height as the Petronas Towers.
But, hehe, have an_ a longer aerial on the roof.
But the, uh, the currency crashed just before they were supposed to finish building it.
So they’re left with a building which is_ can’t be more than about five meters short of the world record.
But it’s not remarkable enough to, to really be all that noteworthy, you know.
Nobody really cares about second best.
Hehe.
So what they’ve done is they have just turned it into a hotel.
And they’ve, managed to say it’s the world’s tallest hotel."
"The job the boy was asked to do was simple enough.
Go down to the field, and cut down the elder tree.
So his father could build a new barn.
'I can't cut down an elder tree,' said the boy.
'Why not.
' 'Well, witches live in elder trees, uh, uh, and, if i cut down their home, they may curse me.
' 'And how pray do the woodman cut down elder trees.
' 'Well, they've got a special rhyme that they say.
And, and they won't tell it to me.
''Go down and chop down that tree, or it's a different sort of wood you'll feel.
' So the boy took his axe, and he went down, to chop down the tree.
Well, with the first blow there was a screech.
Now, some people might say it was one branch against another.
But, how do you explain the blood.
For blood came out of the tree, started running down the trunk.
And when he- hit it again, and again.
There was blood dripping from his axe.
But in time the tree was felled.
But out of the stump, blood started pulsing.
And as the boy looked at the tree, it started to rise up.
The boy threw down his axe, and ran, and ran.
He was going to make for water.
For, he had heard that witches won't cross water.
But, as he ran, the skies darkened, the heavens opened, and rain, heavy rain came down.
And as he looked back, there, silhouetted on the hillside, was a tree, with lightening going from branch to branch.
And, he ran.
And he got to the stream, and he waded across.
And it was sunny on the other side.
There was no rain.
Although it had been raining, and he'd walked through water, his clothes were dry.
And he looked back... And there was no rain on the other side of the stream.
So he made his way back over, and went to where the tree had been.
There was his axe, right enough.
But, clear and shiny, and there was no sign of the tree, not even the stump he had left in the ground.
But he wasn't going to tell anyone.
He went home.
Told his father he'd chopped up the tree, and put all the logs in the wood pile.
And that was the end of it.
He didn't tell anyone.
He didn't tell anyone, for years.
His life changed.
He became a soldier, and eventually he got a farm of his own.
But in Hertfordshire, a long way from his home in Somerset.
And, still he told no one.
Until, the cows went dry.
Oh, he thought just some travellers had been there, and had milked the cows, and this is why they gave no milk.
But the second day, they were dry as well, and a third day.
And that's when he told his wife.
'Oh, someone's cursed you,' she said, expecting her husband to laugh.
But he didn't laugh.
He just told her, about the elder tree, and the witch.
Well, she started to laugh.
But her grandmother who lived with them said, 'ahhh, it will be the witch.
Young man, you must go and get the cows, and bring them down to the field by the house.
'Well, whether it was human beings, or whether it was something stranger, that was good enough advice.
And she said you must g- put a great stone, by the gate, and make the sign of a cross.
So he brought, the cows down.
And he put a stone in front of the gate.
And waited to see what would happen.
And the following morning, early.
He got up, and looked out.
And there in the middle of the cows.
Who were all together in the centre of the field was an elder tree.
And that's when he remembered that he hadn't put the cross there.
Well the old woman seemed to know what to do.
So, he went and woke her up.
'Ah lad, um, your best coat is got silver buttons, hasn't it.
' 'Yes.
' 'Then take, those buttons.
Now, you've still got the machine you used for making bullets in the army, haven't you.
' 'Yes.
' 'Melt down that silver.
And make a silver bullet for your gun.
For they say that you can kill witches with a silver bullet.
'So, he got his best coat, and he cut off the buttons, and he melted the silver down.
And he put them in the little machine.
And pressed out a bullet.
And he put it in his gun, and cautiously he opened the door, and went out, and took aim.
But somehow his feet slipped on the mud, and the shot went wild.
He went back in.
It went dark.
Rain came.
The tree moved towards the house.
He shut the shutters quickly.
But, they could hear the branches beating on the side of the house, as though the tree, the witch was trying to get in.
'What do i do mother.
' 'Ahh,' said the old woman.
'Go and get the bellows, and make up the fire as hot as you can.
Not just red hot, but white hot, if you can.
And get a bucket, and put the coals in, and put ash on top to keep the heat in.
And we'll see if we can burn that witch.
'  And so, that is what he did.
He went and got the bellows.
And started to get the air into the fire.
So that it was red hot.
So that it was white hot.
And then he took all those, coals, and he put them in the bucket.
And he put ash over the top.
And then very carefully, he opened the door, 'eeeuouw' and he threw, that hot coal over the tree.
And it burst into flames.
And in no time at all it was just a pile of ashes.
And the cows grazed on.
'Ah, well.
' Said the old woman, 'it won't be long til we hear of the death of a witch.
'And so it was.
Although news doesn't travel as fast then, as it does now.
It wasn't long before news came from Somerset, that old Annie had been found dead.
Burnt to death in her cottage.
But what was stranger still.
There was no sign of a fire.
Not even, in her hearth."
"He was the unluckiest man in the world.
He was a man who fell off ladders.
He was a man who got bitten by dogs.
He was a man whose crops wouldn’t grow.
And hens wouldn’t lay.
So he decided, he was going to go out on the mountain to see God.
And he was going to ask God why he was the unluckiest man in the world.
And so bright and early one morning he set off.
And he was going through the forest at the foot of the mountain, and he came face to face with a tiger.
And this was the thinnest tiger you have ever seen.
He was like a stripy se_ bag of bones.
'Where ya goin’.
' Said the tiger.
'I am going up the mountain to see God and ask him why i am so unlucky.
' Said the man.
'Well, if you see God,' said the tiger, 'ask him why i am so thin.
''I will do that.
I will do that.
' Said the man.
And he went on along the pathway.
And he came out of the forest and, came to a place where the path, ran along side a steep precipice.
And it was just wide enough for him to edge his way along it.
And as he was going along the path sideways, there was a tree standing in the way.
And this was a sorry looking tree.
It was thin and it only had one leaf.
And the tree said to the man, 'where are you going.
'And the man said, 'I am going up the mountain to see God and i am going to ask him why, i am the unluckiest man in the world.
''Well, if you see God,' said the thin tree, 'will you ask him why, i only ever have one leaf.
''Yes, yes, i, i will ask him that if you will just ease aside and let me pass.
' Said the man.
So the tree eased aside, and the man, wriggled past and went on up the pathway.
And he came off the pathway, and he came to a valley.
And were beautiful flowers and the grass was tall, and there were birds singing, and there were beautiful trees full of fruit.
And this, he realized was paradise.
And as he walked through paradise, out of a beautiful house came the most lovely lady he had ever seen.
And she came and stood in the path in front of him and said, 'where are you going.
'And he said, 'i am going up the mountain to see God.
And I am going to ask him why I am the unluckiest man in the world.
''Well, if you see God,' said the beautiful lady, 'will you ask him why i am so lonely.
''Yes, yes, i'll ask him that.
I'll ask him that.
' Said the man, and went hurrying on his way.
Until he came, right to the top of the mountain where God, was sitting under a tree, with a glass of wine.
And God looked at the man and said, 'what can i do for you.
'And the man said, 'God, i have come all the way up this mountain to ask you, why i am the unluckiest man in the world.
'And God took a sip of his wine and said, 'well, since you have gone to all that trouble to come up the mountain and ask me that.
I will grant you something.
Today could turn out to be the luckiest day of your life.
''Oh thank you, God,' said the man.
'Wow.
' He said, 'today is going to be the luckiest day of my life.
' And he turned around to go hurrying back down the mountain.
And he suddenly remembered, and he turned around.
'Oh God, i met this tiger and this tree, and this beautiful woman on the way up here.
And they had some questions for you too.
' And he asked the questions, and God gave him the answers.
And so the man turned and went hurrying off back down the mountain.
And as he came down through that valley of paradise... There was the beautiful woman.
'Did you see God.
' She said.
'Yes, i did.
And do you know what he told me.
He told me today could be the luckiest day of my life.
' And he was about to hurry on and the woman said, 'did you ask him why i am so lonely.
''Oh yes,' said the man 'yes.
Now what was it he said.
Oh he said, you are so lonely because you don't have a husband.
And what you should do is marry the first man, you see.
''Well,' said the beautiful woman, 'that's you.
You and i, could be married, and you could live with me here in paradise for the rest of your days.
''Oh, no, no, no,' said the man.
'No, no, I have got to hurry on down.
Today could be the luckiest day of my life.
' So he goes hurrying on.
And he comes to the narrow path above the precipice and he is easing his way along it and he comes to the tree.
And the tree says, 'did you see God.
''Yes, yes, and do you know what he told me.
He told me today could be the luckiest day of my life.
' And he was about to squeeze past when the tree says, 'did you ask him why i only ever have one leaf.
''Oh yes,' said the man, 'yes i did.
And ,what was it he said.
He said, oh, you only have one leaf because your roots won’t grow.
And your roots won't grow is because buried underneath them is a great big chest full of gold.
And what you have to do is you have to ask the first man you see to dig out that gold and take it away.
''Why that is you,' said the tree, 'you can dig up the gold and take it away and be rich.
' 'Oh, no, no, no,' said the man.
'I have got to hurry on down.
Today could be the luckiest day of my life.
'So, he hurries on, till he comes though the forest.
And as he is going through the forest, there standing in his way, is the thin tiger.
'Did you see God.
' Says the tiger.
'Yes, yes, I did, and you know what he told me.
He told me today could be the luckiest day of my life.
' And he was about to hurry past when the tiger says, 'did you ask him why i am so thin.
''Oh yes,' said the man, 'yes i did.
And what was it he told me.
Oh, he said you are so thin, because you don’t eat enough and what you should do is eat, the first foolish man that you see.
''Grrrrr' said the tiger."
"In nineteen seventy-six we were planning in United States to celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of our country.
And because of this the entire world agreed to join us in our celebration.
And from each country around the world, they sent their greatest ships, with the masts and sent them over to America so that on the fourth of July these great ships made a parade, in New York, in New York Harbor.
And they were from all over the world.
When one of the ships arrived, from Spain it came by way of Florida where i was living.
And, we had a boat rental business on the ocean.
So in the morning when we opened up our business we saw, anchored off Government Cut this huge, big four-masted barkentine.
And we were so excited about seeing it, outside of our waters that we rigged up one of our sail boats and we sailed over to her, to see who it was.
And it was the Spanish ship the (Juan Sebastian de Elcono) and in_ near_ as we neared to it_ grew nearer, we saw that all the sailors were out on the rigging and they were waving at us and singing to us.
And they were all excited because we were there.
And we sailed around her twice.
And then came back to our base where we had started from.
Now, the, the ship finally entered the harbor and it was put on display.
So my husband and the boys that worked for us went over to see the ship.
And one of the officers, joined us and took us on a marvelous cru- a marvelous tour, of this ship.
In return for his attention my husband who was a sea captain, invited him to visit our beach where we had smaller boats.
So the very next morning, i picked up this officer and brought him over to where we had our boats.
And when he entered the, beach area and saw that we had rigged up that same boat he was amazed because in order to identify my boat i had put colors on the sails.
And this man from the Spanish ship thought_ told us that the entire crew thought that we were the welcoming committee from the United States because, the colors were red white and blue.
And all the sailors accepted that we welcomed them to America.
Hehehehe"
"When you are in business, um, you have to wear_ especially if you are in, a small business_ you have to wear many different hats.
And you find yourself having to, uh, be concerned with, uh, financing.
And be concerned about incorporation, and laws, and human resources, and personnel.
And all of the different elements and components that make up a successful small business.
So I think in many regards, operating and running a small business is much more difficult, than being a specialist in a larger company.
Where you can just spend all of your days specializing in one particular field of the business.
One of the areas that I have, always enjoyed the most in my small business experience, um, has been in working with staff.
And knowing how to hire people and how to, surround yourself with the people who you will eventually, depend upon to have a successful business operation.
And, um, in my small business in Illinois I was very, uh, intent on finding people who had, expertise and skills that were far superior to mine, in the areas that I didn't know.
So I was, interested in surrounding myself with people, who would challenge me.
Um, and encouraging them to grow and learn from each other.
So my form of, of management was, uh, creating a sense of family but not in the sense, that the Japanese did it.
It was, uh, our organ- our organizational structure was, was based on a wheel with spokes.
And each of the staff, represented a spoke in that wheel.
And they would have to bring a certain strength to the wheel to make sure that that wheel turned.
And the cog in the wheel, was actually the business plan, or the objective of the business.
And we were all working to make sure that that cog stayed nice and strong.
And that we stayed focused on that.
And as time went on I f- I learned from my experience, the more I encouraged other people to learn and_ each other's skills, and to cross train, the more, they gave to the business.
Because they knew that they were learning skills that they didn't originally have.
And that they would be taking those skills with them, wherev- wherever they would go in the future.
So they knew that it was not only a training ground, for them personally and professionally, but that they were also helping to grow the business.
And today, uh, these employees that I have worked with for so many years, uh, continue to stay in touch with me.
And I grow very proud to learn of their progress over the years, that they have continued with this philosophy, that we imparted in the small business.
And they have continued to perpetuate that philosophy wherever they go now in the world.
And many of them are traveling internationally.
And they have risen in the ranks of, uh, other small corporations, or larger corporations.
And it really is, um, quite a joy to me and one of the things that I cherish the most in being a business person."
"The first story I want to tell you, is called 'The Wish'.
It's quite a short story.
Almost in the, genre, shall we say, of a riddle.
There was a very poor man.
He lived in a tiny little hut.
He lived with his wife.
And, he lived with his elderly mother.
One day, he went out into the woods, wondering how on earth he could get enough money together.
And, suddenly, he saw a fairy.
And the fairy said to him, seeing that he was so poor.
'I can grant you a wish.
' 'Ah- oh,' said the man, 'not two wishes.
Not three.
I mean it's usually three that they give you, isn't it.
' 'No,' said the fairy, 'one wish.
You must think hard, and long, and well.
Come back when you want to tell me your wish, and I will grant it.
'So the man went home.
Very puzzled, very worried.
And he told his wife that he'd been granted this one wish.
And she looked at him, and tears filled her eyes, and she said, 'oh, but you know how I've longed for a baby.
Could you not ask the fairy to grant you your wish of a baby.
' The man sighed.
And hardly had he thought about that, than his elderly mother came in.
Limping in, feeling her way with her hands, for she was blind.
And when she heard that her son had been granted a wish from a fairy.
She said, 'oh, but how I long to have my sight again.
Could you not wish that my sight should be restored.
' The man sighed, and frowned, and thought, because all that he wished for was gold.
A pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
The next morning he went back.
Because that night he'd had a dream.
And when he met the fairy, she asked him, 'what is your wish going to be.
' And he said to her, 'i wish, that my mother could see her grandchild, in a cradle made of gold.
' And so, they lived happily ever after.
For the wish was granted."
"Think of the first time you saw people windsurfing.
Or surfing in the sea.
You could see the power of the wind.
You could see the power of the sea.
But it still seemed magical.
So, imagine what it was like, in the seventeenth century.
The time of the English Civil War.
When there was to be a big battle, fought, in the town of Newbury, in Berkshire.
And the soldiers, the parliamentary soldiers, were foraging for food, as soldiers will do.
And they were larking about, as young men will do.
And one of them climbed a tree, to get away from his fellows.
And there, on the water of the river, he saw a woman.
A tall, willowy figure.
But she seemed to be standing, on the water.
Well this is the time in (xx xx) in our country of witches.
This could only be a witch.
And she twisted her body, this way and that.
And seemed to glide across the surface of the water.
He called his friends to him, and they came and looked.
It could only be a witch.
Now, on the other side of the river, some of the commanders of that same army, were walking along.
And they, too, saw the woman.
And she seemed to be coming towards them.
And then she saw them.
And she twisted her body.
And that's when they saw the piece of wood, she was using to get across the river.
And she twisted her body, so that she was coming down, further away from them.
But, they too, were sure this was a witch.
And two of their number, who were fine shots, and good marksmen.
They took aim, and shot at her.
But she just turned towards them, on the shore where she'd landed.
And put up her hands, and caught the bullets, one in each hand.
And turned her hands over, and showed the bullets to the soldiers.
And laughed.
And one of them was so angry.
He went running up to her.
And he put his carbide_ his ancient gun, against her chest.
And shot.
And, the bullet recoiled, as though it was a child's toy.
This was definitely a witch.
What were they going to do.
And then, one of them remembered, that if you shot a witch, through the temple, beside the eye.
That would kill them.
And so they rushed up to her, and two of them grabbed her, held her arms.
And she just looked at them and spoke for the first time.
And said, 'that if it is to be so, that this day i am killed.
Then, his grace, the Earl of Essex, will win the battle, for the parliamentary side.
' And they shot her.
And so it was, that the Earl of Essex won the day.
But, that was not the end of the story.
Though that is what was written down in the newspapers of the time.
Near the spot, where she'd come to the shore, there was a little chapel.
And all sorts of strange things started happening, in the graveyard of that chapel.
Such that in time people wouldn't go there for the services.
And that little church fell into decay.
Well, then the people of Newbury, many years later thought, 'well, if we made it a hostel for young people passing through the town.
They wouldn't know the stories, of all the strange things that had happened there.
' And so, it was made into a hostel.
And in time, they built an extension.
A new bit of the building, across the graveyard, for a kitchen.
And pots and pans started falling off the shelves.
And all sorts of strange sounds were heard at night.
In time, it was abandoned, as a hostel.
And again fell into decay.
Until, not long after the Second World War, the County Council, the local authority, decided to build a youth and community centre there.
Nothing happens there now.
But when it was being built, all sorts of strange sights were seen.
Particularly, by some of the Irish men, who worked on the site.
But, even the English couldn't explain the piles of bricks which were delivered one night.
And were found, still piled up the following day... But, several meters, away from where they'd been put.
So, it makes you think, doesn't it? 			"
"Here's a story from, Morocco, in the north of Africa.
Once upon a time there were two woodcutters.
And everyday they would set off with their axes, and their ropes.
And up the the hillside they would go, to chop wood to bring back, for the fire for their wives.
On this particular day, they were walking through the grand slopes of the- hill that they were climbing.
It was very woody there, and they couldn't see very far into the trees on either side.
But, suddenly one of them stopped, and grasped the other, and said, 'hey, look.
' And they both looked through the woods.
And they saw the flick of a lion's tail.
And a greedy tongue, [slurping noises] licking it's chops.
'Woo,' said one woodcutter to the other.
'Oh, i'm not going on, any further today.
I'm going to go home.
' 'Don't be so frightened, i mean, just a lion.
Look he's an old thing.
He's not taking any notice of us.
And what's your wife going to say, if you go back with no firewood.
' 'Oh, oh, all right then, well quick, let's make a dash for it.
'So the two of them quickened their paces.
And soon they found themselves, at the top of the hill.
And they were chopping down all of the old dead wood.
And making a great big bundle.
And at the end of the day, they tied up their bundles with the rope.
Slung them over their shoulders.
And they were just about to set off down the hill.
When the one who'd been very frightened by the lion said, 'hey, i- i- i'm not going down on that path again.
' 'Why ever not.
' Said the other.
'Well, don't you remember.
There was a lion, he'll be waiting for us.
' 'Oh, don't be stupid.
' 'I'm not going that way.
I'm going to take the long way over the hill home.
' 'All right,' said the other, 'please yourself.
See you back at home.
' 'I hope i do.
'So, the two of them parted.
And our friend set off down the path, on the usual path, on his way home.
But when he came to a certain bend in the path, he saw sitting there, large as life, a great big golden-maned lion.
He was transfixed with fear himself.
And didn't know quite what to do, but he- he managed to mumble something like, 'uh, the, the, oh, ha ha, good day to you, oh lion.
Ha ha, and what can i be doing for you.
' The lion replied.
'Oh, good day to you, oh son of man.
Well... I'll tell you what you can do.
You see, i've got a great big hole in my stomach, and there's nothing i'd like more than the brain of a man to fill it.
' 'Oh, oh, oh, yeah, i s- see,' said the woodcutter.
And his brain went into overdrive [whirring sound], thinking as quickly as he could, what could he do to get out of this situation.
'Oh, oh yes, the, the brain, very tasty, yeah, oh, but you see, i'll have to disappoint you lion.
' 'Disappoint me.
What do you mean.
' 'Well, you see, i, i ain't got no brain.
' 'No brain.
' 'No, i mean i, i'm not the one with the brain.
It was the other one, that you saw, on our way up here.
Now he's got the brain, because he says, we might meet you, and he's taken the long road, over the 'ill home.
A_ you know, if you hurry, you might catch him.
' 'Ohhh,' said the lion.
'Oh, thanks very much.
Yeah i will.
' Woosht... And away he bounded, up and over the hill.
And the story never tells us, who did get home safely.
That's the end of the story."
"Um, as well as, um, doing the work for OUP and the, the teaching, i also work in a club called the Zodiac.
Um, it is sort of, uh, uh, i suppose the biggest venue in, in Oxford, um, for live bands.
So, you know, if a band is coming to play, um, let’s say, playing a national tour.
If they are, you know, going to have an Oxford date, it is almost certainly going to be at the Zodiac.
There are, increasingly the last sort of four years since i came to Oxford, I have noticed how many more, smaller venues are opening up.
Um, and it is interesting i think, there is a lot more live music now than there was.
Um, and_ but,  as i say if, you know, it is sort of, um, middle of the, middle of the range, um, uh, band is, is playing a national tour they will have, uh, an Ox_ uh, if they are having an Oxford date, they will be at the Zodiac.
Um, so its_ it is quite an interesting place to work, in that you get to hear some, sort of, quite a lot of very different bands.
Quite interesting.
You know, i wouldn’t perhaps,um, in the normal run of things manage to hear such a diversity of stuff live.
Um, also the nights when there isn’t a band maybe there will be one, at the most two a week.
Um, when there isn’t a live band playing, um, there sort of, various sorts of club nights.
There's, obviously, the, the management will be very keen to get down the sort of well known London DJs.
Um, but they are usually very, very hard to get them to come down, other than, you know, early in the week nights.
There_ there is quite a good night on a, a Tuesday called Euphoria, when, um, usually very well known, um, London DJs come down.
And that, that is quite good.
I like that sort of music.
House and Trance and it, it is very good.
Um, other nights are totally different.
Wednesday nights are, sort of student night.
There is lots of, um, offers usually on the, the booze and, um, it, it is usually, um, usually quite, you know, nebulous sort of music playing.
It is mostly a sort of, uh, excuse to attract students out midweek.
Um, it is generally, not a nice night to work.
It is usually too many people too drunk, um, and the, the music is nothing to listen too.
Um, Thursday nights are sort of easy listening night when they, play all sorts of things, you know.
You, you might find in your parents, um, record collection.
And each night the decor's totally changed.
So, it, it's, it's  quite amusing, the easy listening night.
But, um, you wouldn’t want to have too much of it.
I cant imagine, there is that many people would come every week to it, but it, it's a good, like fun night out if, um, you are coming out, you know, to, with a group of friends to chat and enjoy yourself rather than, you know, to, to, dance yourself till you drop.
So, it 's.
It's good.
Um, there's_ weekends there's various things.
Um, some drum and bass and, um, that’s alternating with sort of, um, more sort of Indi-disco type stuff.
So it is a quite varied amount of nights and, um, you know, most people would, you know, find something they want.
Again, in the, in the bands you have sort of everything from world music to, um, you know, quite nebulous poppy sort of stuff.
So, um, all in all it is a nice place to work and you get to hear a large variety of music."
"So last year was my first freshman year of college.
And i made friends with all these seniors, um, who_ their favorite activity would be to sit around and talk about politics, especially communism.
And, i didn't really have solidified, uh, political beliefs at all.
Um, so that's one of my goals right now.
I need to solidify my political beliefs.
But... All these people would sit around talking about, communism.
And, you know, they'd_ some of them were not _ would not consider themselves communists, but some would.
Some call each other comrade, you know, bake bread together say, &quot;hey comrade, you know, pass the salt.
&Quot; and uh_ so i usually agree with this_ with these people about most things.
But i'm not so sure about communism.
So i, picked up the Communist Manifesto and i've read half of it so far.
And i really like it.
But i mentioned this to my communist friend, and he said, &quot;oh yeah, that's just propaganda, you have to read Das Capital.
&Quot; so i guess, that'll be my next project for the next time i feel like reading a thousand pages."
"A good book.
I think the best book in the English language is, <em>Three Men in a Boat</em>.
By Jerome K.
Jerome.
I, i've read it about fifty times, i would think, by now.
But i really couldn't be sure.
It could be a lot more than that.
Certainly, i've read parts of it more often than that.
Because there are particular parts of it, that are so funny, ha ha.
That, i still laugh allowed when i read them.
And i always take it on holiday with me, and, um, i've managed to train my current boyfriend to appreciate reading aloud.
So, we read it aloud on holiday, to each other, whenever we go on holiday.
We bring travel books in general, and read them aloud to each other.
But that one, is always one of the ones, that comes with us.
It was written about a hundred years ago.
And, one of the things that the guy in it does, is makes predictions about appalling Victorian monstrosities, that he says, in his most extreme flight of ridiculous fantasy, 'they'll probably think i'm marvellous, in ooh twenty eighty-eight.
' Whereas actually they were already they were marvellous in 1988.
It's the most incredibly accessible book.
The characters in it, are so, modern somehow.
They don't seem to have dated, which i suspect means that he wrote more sincerely, probably, than most people write ever.
Not just that most people wrote of his time.
Because, they aren't_ the description of the characters, while they are behaving, within the culture of the time.
The characters feel like people you know.
And so, his perception of people has gone beyond the cultural filter.
So, it's just superb.
But, as a hilarious book that, i would imagine.
Twenty-five percent of people in England, today, know, well enough to recognise the name.
And possibly even to quote their favourite bit.
It's, it's just hilariously funny.
I was read it by my father first, when i was about nine.
And, i remember the whole family just in tears of laughter, first.
Long enough that we all had to put the book down and, and recover.
And were giggling about it for the rest of the day.
I won't quote you the bits.
I won't spoil it for you, you should go and find it, and read it.
It's not too difficult, you can manage."
" last summer, i went to Hawaii.
And i had scheduled to meet a friend who i had met... In New Jersey which is where i live.
And so i met the friend in New Jersey and, she was living in Chicago and then i was in L-A.
And we said &quot;well let's meet up in Hawaii,&quot; because she was on her way to Vietnam where she was going to teach English.
And i knew that she would stop over in Hawaii.
So i said &quot;well what if your stop over in Hawaii was more than just a couple of hours, what if it was for a week&quot;.
So she said &quot;all right.
Let's meet in Hawaii.
&Quot; so i went from L-A to Hawaii and she went from Chicago to Hawaii.
We met in Hawaii.
And, uh, the activity which we planned was going to be to go to a Tibetan Buddhist retreat.
So for one week we would stay at a, center_ a small isolated place in Hawaii where, um, a Tibetan Buddhist lama was going to talk about Tibetan Buddhism, and teach the philosophy and the psychology, and teach us the meditation.
And this particular week he was going to teach, uh, meditation which is very specific and which is very unusual, which i haven't heard of existing in other religions, like Christianity, or Islam, or Judaism or even in other types of Buddhism.
And this is a practice which is for, the moment of death.
And in this meditation, you practice for just one week.
And in this one week's time, you can receive a sign.
And the sign can be like a dream or, um, a vision or even a physical sign on your body like, it's very peculiar but you can receive a physical sign like a small hole on the top of your head, the very crown of your head, or even a little fluid or a little blood coming out, or a little softness at this top of your head.
And this is a sign that_ or the dream or the vision, this is a sign that, the practice is successful.
That when you die you will be able to, um, do this practice, which you've done for one week, and you'll be able to do it at the moment of your death.
And then your death will be able to be something, very, uh, transformative, something very beneficial, something which can really help you, which is something that you don't need to fear or, um, worry about.
That you can say &quot;oh, i've done this practice, and i know what i need to do&quot;.
And then your death can be something very special.
So this is very unusual, i i don't know if this is_ this sort of things exists in other traditions.
So we said &quot;ok, let's go see what this is about, this sounds very unusual very interesting.
And, let's go see what this is like.
&Quot; so_ and we, and we also thought &quot;hey it's in Hawaii it's_ even if it's, totally bazaar or this is a cult or, this is rubbish and this is a fraud um, we are going to be in Hawaii and, we've never been there so let's go see what's it like.
So this retreat was very intense, um, this seven days was very demanding to go to the teachings and listen to what the lama was teaching.
And then to do the actual meditation practice was really demanding mentally and physically.
We felt very tired, um, throughout the day from doing this practice.
It_ the lama which is the name of the teacher in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, he said that yes this practice, because it's for the time of death, it's working with the_ e- energy in your body, and that while you're doing it so intensely for a week, when you're doing it everyday, several times a day, that you are going to feel it in the energy of you body.
So, it would be very demanding and you'll feel tired.
And we definitely felt that.
But we were so happy to be in Hawaii.
Hawaii is unlike any place i've ever been.
It really is, to me, from my experience, where i've grown up in New Jersey or maybe i 'v been in England, or the west coast of America, Hawaii is completely different.
And, the way i would describe it is that everything in Hawaii is alive.
That the air_ there's a certain, vitality and energy, a sense of life in the air and the wind, and the temperature of the air.
It_ the sun coming down on your skin is, vibrant.
That the the feel of it is very, um, re- can be really felt, can really make you feel like you're alive.
And the same thing with the many many plants which grow there.
Everything is so green.
And everyday it seems to rain at least a part of the day.
So there's a great sense of the clouds moving, and the rain moving along with, this very_ um, sort of clear sun.
And the temperature, and the earth feels very alive.
And there's many unusual plants and animals which i hadn't seen.
And, um, because Hawaii is just several islands, they're fairly small and so no matter where you are on the island, you can either see or hear the ocean.
And the ocean is just so powerful, which, is different,um, for me even if i went to a, ocean or beach in California or New Jersey, it's very alive.
So we had a very unusual experience in Hawaii, doing this meditation practice which was very unusual, as well as experiencing the, the climate and the nature in Hawaii. "
"Tijuana and, San Diego are, within, less than a mile of each other.
And they're two completely different worlds.
As soon as you step over the border into Mexico, you know that you are no longer, in the United States of America.
Everything is entirely different.
Uh, it's lot more rundown.
Unfortunately, Tijuana's not the best example of Mexico and its beauty and its culture.
Uh, it's more like a ghetto at some parts.
But, if you go there, you can still, see the Mexican culture brimming through.
For example, if you just want to go buy a poncho, there's a lot more involved... In buying a poncho in Mexico than there ever would be in buying a, a coat or a sweater in the United States.
In America you are given a price and, the customer accepts it and buys it and that's that.
And in Mexico, uh, the, the store owners want to play with you a little bit.
You_ they give a really high price and you are expected to give a really low price and you compromise, and you settle on a price.
And Americans completely aren't used to do that.
They get there and I, I know I was dumbfounded when somebody said, &quot;oh name your price.
&Quot; I had no clue what to do and, and there's something that's haha that's really interesting about, about the store owners and merchants is they'll do anything, and they'll follow you around, and uh... Uh, just to, just to get that one sale and the one buy.
That's something that an American shop owner would never do."
"Um, things that people should learn at school.
That i think they should teach but never do.
Um, something i've found, that i wished i'd known about.
I- i- it's about the law.
Just the general sort of, day-to-day what, rights we have, and what rights we don't have.
And, and, if you go out for a walk in the countryside, and there you see a sign, &quot;private do not trespass.
&Quot; what does that really mean.
You know what_ when you buy a house, do you really buy it.
Or, or is it just on loan from the Queen, or_ wha- what does it all mean.
Um, it would be nice if, people were taught, what the law was actually about at school.
And how to interpret what they read in law books.
Rather than leave it to, solicitors.
Um, i think the ignorance that, that people gain from not understanding the law leaves all these solicitors and bods li_ in the same sort of... Room as, high priests almost, or something else.
You know, masked in mysticism.
And long words of jargon.
Another thing i think people should_ wou_ if_ that it would be nice for people to learn at school.
Is, just the ability to sit, and meditate perhaps.
Just a_ a- and i think they teach it at_ to some degree, in, in play.
But... They need to pay more attention to it.
They need to pay more attention to it, because so much of, what people spend their time doing, is just sort of_ it's transient.
It's not, it's not, worthwhile.
It's like birds singing.
Or monkeys chattering, or something.
It's a_ they just do it because they, they can.
But at the end of the day is_ is so much of what they've said, uh, sort of really worthwhile o- or... I think they'd find if people thought about it, that, a lot of what they say isn't, sort of, of any value.
Um, and meditation that's sort of, uh, that gives you time to think.
It allows you to be, comfortable with your silences.
Or with other people's silences.
It also, allows you to, sort of, be aware of the way you feel.
And the way people, interact, in a non-linguistic manner."
"I used to live in a small village in Africa.
And, this is how they used to hunt.
They would make spears... From very straight sticks and they had, iron tips.
They also made nets.
In fact when i was living there... It was amazing there was a blind man, who made these nets.
He made it from, twine that he... Wove together into a very good net.
When someone knew that some animals were nearby, the people would gather, and some men would spread the net, through part of the forest.
The net could be about, um... Ten meters or, fifteen meters long.
Other people would try to be, behind the animals... And make a lot of noise, and scare the animals so they would run into the net.
Then some other people, who were near the net would take their spears, and, try to spear the animal and kill it.
There were a lot of animals there.
The biggest ones were elephants.
There were also warthogs which are like, wild pigs.
And there were a lot of different kind of animals that are similar to deer.
They always liked it when they, caught an animal, because they didn't have cattle there.
And when they caught an animal, they would, cut it up and share out the meat."
"I haven't got a passport at the moment.
Because, it's completely stuck in the British backlog, of passports, that's going on.
I still do quite a lot of travelling.
The kind of travelling that I do, is over the intellectual landscape.
By joining, a mailing list.
A Listserv-distributed news group.
Sometimes it's one that's reflected on a, on a newsgroup that you can sign up to, with a news reader.
But, mainly I prefer the ones, which are a little mailing list, that's a private e-mail discussion.
Because, you get more of a feeling of... Privacy, and a proper clique develops.
A real sense that this is a group of people with a shared values.
And, you can experience, a different, culture, in that it's a, a particular kind of subculture.
Rather than a national culture.
And I think they're, very pure cultures.
Probably because they're smaller and, less... Diverse, than a nation is.
The first one that I joined.
Was actually um, for practical reasons.
Um, I went deaf, for, a few weeks.
It turned out to be something that could be reversed.
But, for a couple of weeks, I was com_ well, pretty much completely deaf.
And, I couldn't... I didn't know whether this was going to be a permanent condition.
Um, and so I thought, well, either I can go, oh woe is me, and put my life on hold for two weeks.
Or I can go for it.
And I thought, well, if I'm going to get better, then that's great.
And I may as well use this as an opportunity to find out, as much as possible, about what it's like to be deaf, as I can.
Or, I can, just start learning now.
If I'm not going to get better.
I may as well get the hang of it right off.
So, I read a lot of books about being deaf.
And through them I discovered, <em>DeafList</em>.
And joined their mailing list.
And, discovered that, that really is another culture.
I think much more than any of the other ones I've joined since.
There's an_ a nation of, deaf, and, they have a whole set of_ because i- it's communication problems with the hearing world.
But there's an enormous set of issues.
There's, um, goodies and baddies, and political correctness.
And, um, threats to the society.
And issues of tolerance towards other societies.
And internally_ it's absolutely fascinating.
It's the whole world in microcosm.
And it was a thrilling, few weeks.
As it was I got better, and decided to move on, and dip into somebody else's culture.
And that was how the habit got started.
It's really great, I'd recommend it to anyone."
"In that part of Oxfordshire, which is still in many hearts Berkshire, lived true John.
He was an old man, with a cottage, and a garden, and an apple tree.
Oh, you've never tasted apples as sweet, as the apples on that tree.
People came from miles to buy them.
Even from Oxford city.
But, he would never give them more than a pound, or charge them more than ten pence.
He said his friends liked it so.
But who were his friends.
Well, the trees, it w- always full of birds singing.
And at night, lights like grow [glow] worms.
A very different man was his neighbour, greedy Jack.
He was a wealthy man, with many orchards.
And there were no birds in his trees.
He shot at them.
Once, he tried to shoot the birds in John's tree.
But a great green cloud came all about him.
And when he went back to his own orchards, all the apples had little holes in them, as though they'd been shot with pellets.
Well, John as I said, was an old man, and in time he died.
And who got his cottage, but greedy Jack.
And to spite the folk they say, he cut down the apple tree.
And at night, there was sweet singing, and many lights.
And the voices were saying, ""true John, is gone gone gone.
True John is gone.""  and the lights went out one by one.
And the voices stopped, one by one.
'Til there was but one voice saying, ""we'll not be back.
We'll not be back.""  and they say, there has been no luck about the place, from that day, until this."
"I've had a lot of experience with both the U-K and the U-S, educational systems.
And, the U-S has, a lot of colleges and universities.
Some of them are really, top notch.
Some of them are not, that good.
My impression is that in U-K... It's more competitive in general to get into, university, because a smaller percentage of their students go to university, than in the U-S.
In some ways this makes a lot of sense because, then when they get out of university they, are, definitely qualified to do what they were trained to do.
And also, we have the problem in the U-S that, a lot of people graduate, and there aren't enough jobs for people in their field. "
"Well now I'd like to talk a little bit about Ukrainian food.
I've spent almost two years in the United States, so now I can feel the difference between American food and Ukrainian food.
First of all, the difference definitely is not as big as between American and Japanese cuisine, for example.
It's not as different.
But, there is till some, difference in certain dishes, and in, and, some general differences also are present.
For example, Ukrainians don't eat that much noodles, and in, general that much pasta as Americans do.
Probably this is just Italian influence in American food.
Ukrainians generally eat more potatoes, and more bread than Americans do.
And, definitely Ukrainian bread is quite different from that in the United States.
It's much more dense in_ it's pretty similar to French or Italian bread, that sometimes you have in a grocery store.
But, it's still pretty different.
Another thing that is, very specific, of Ukrainian food is that, the Ukrainians eat a lot of soups.
It's not that specific for America.
And it's not quite that kind of soup that American would have.
It's whole_ it's a whole dish.
It's very complicated thing.
And usually the preparation would take one, two, maybe, three hours.
But the result would be wonderful.
That soup can_ has many components, a lot of vegetables, meat, potatoes and, a lot of spices.
And when you cook it properly the result would be simply great.
You won't_ you wouldn't be able to resist.
So that is great part about that.
Russians also have similar dish, but it's a little bit more simple.
Ukrainians devote a lot more time to creating that kind of masterpiece.
Another, difference between Ukrainian and American food would be absence of such thing as fast-food, for example.
We do have some small cafes, and restaurants, but there is no such distinct class of food as you do have  in the States.
For example, hamburgers and, uh, snacks, and that kind of light food that you would have for lunch, for example.
We don't have that.
And usually it's quite a surprise for Ukrainian, who gets to the United States for the first time to find this, fast-food places with totally different food.
That's why sometimes it, takes a pretty long time for people from Eastern Europe and from Russia, from Ukraine, to get used to American food."
"One of the things i love to do most is shopping.
Most definitely.
So i decided that i'd make a job out of shopping.
And i became an undercover shopper.
This means that, i go to different stores, and act like i'm shopping.
But really i'm observing, the associates, making sure that they're doing a good job, and they, ask the customers the right questions and they service them properly.
And it's nice for revenge, especially when, they don't do their job, i know i can get 'em in trouble.
But it's just a lot of fun cuz i get paid to shop.
And, it's probably one of the best jobs i've ever done.
I know all the malls in this area, and i've been to New York, and... It's good experience."
"I am a D.Phil. student in law.
This means that I have been, basically studying law for the last seven years of my life.
And, I probably have two or three more years.
Most people that I have met, um, have_ or people in the street have two very strong view on laws.
The first thing is that_ law what a technical subject.
And what a boring subject.
And the second thing is that, they're pretty much scared by lawyers.
Um, which they thinks are, most of the time, a rip offs.
Um, I have to say that, when I started law I was, um, quite repelled by the technical aspect of it.
Um, it's a lot of learning by heart.
It's a lot of learning the cases, um, techni- technicity, vocabulary.
It's very demanding.
And I understand the people in the street who feel, about law, as it's abstract and complicated sibylline thing.
Uh, it is.
You have to study it to understand it.
However, maybe if law was explained to people, in the sense that it's everywhere.
Whatever you do is covered by law basically.
Um, when you walk in the street there is a, uh, there is a sort of administrative relation between you and the city council for_ because the city council has to provide for appropriate pavement.
When you decide to go and buy some bread, well, you pass a contract of sale of goods with, um, the person you're purchasing the bread from.
 Um, when you get into a bus, you have a contract with a bus company.
When, um, you happen to get into a fight, after probably you have drunk too much.
Well, you might incur, uh, civil responsibility for it.
When you decide to get married, um, it is governed by law, and by family law.
Similarly, your relationship with your children, um, etcetera.
So basically, every aspect of life is governed by law.
And, once you get away from the technicality of law.
Then law becomes fascinating, because it is at the heart of the society.
And at the heart of whatever people do.
Although they might not realise it.
And, since la- o- on the other hand, since law is so technical, lawyers are very helpful.
They tend to abuse of their_ the sort of monopoly that they have as being_ having the knowledge of law.
But, they ha_ they are, um, really useful.
And they, they have a really useful task in the society in, in helping people with their legal issues, and, uh, I think this is, this is, um, this is why I like studying law."
"After secondary school, um, wh- what some people do is go on to further education.
I went to university for a year.
And i studied aeronautical engineering.
I decided that this wasn't quite, my cup of tea, after the first term.
And after that, embarked on a very very long holiday.
At the end of the first year i left university and didn't look back.
I got a flat together with some people and started a new job, working in a factory somewhere in North London.
I didn't like the job too much.
So, af- after about six months i left that job.
And then did a string of various jobs.
Um, changing every two, three weeks i think it was.
I always had to do some work in some way shape or form to pay the rent.
So, after about the first year i think it was i had sort of done, uh, a fair spectrum of things.
Um, after that, um, i, started becoming a_ well i started decorating restaurants.
I met a couple of artists who were doing that sort of thing.
And they, they got contract work.
So i joined in with them.
They also played music.
And that's how i ended up starting to play the drums.
In the evenings after they'd finished work, they'd sort of sit around the restaurant.
And we'd get fed, and that was very grand.
And we'd drink and, about ten, eleven o'clock in the evening, we'd sort of get up our instruments and just jam.
I started doing that when i was about_ what, twenty.
And, have been playing the drums ever since.
And now it's eight nine years on.
So, i've been playing for quite a long time."
"I read a very interesting article, about, uh... To make your home safer, and, uh, free from being target for burglar, burglars.
Well actually somebody, uh, questioned, uh, i don’t know how many, but, uh, many, uh, burglars.
And particularly, how and why, they chose particular targeted houses.
And, uh, well  that study, uh, obviously, uh, showed, uh, very interesting tendencies.
And i’m going to share that interesting tendencies with you.
Well, first... They choose a house without, uh, storm windows.
The reason was... If, houses are_ houses have storm windows, usually storm windows have couple of layers of, uh, glasses there.
And, uh, it’s pretty difficult to, uh, make, uh, open without broken glasses or making noise.
So that... They see, you know, our house's windows, and if they have storm windows they avoid.
And second... Well, this is very important because, we, we have tendency to tell friends, or acquaintances like the repairmen, or delivery men something like that, &quot;oh i'm going to go to vacation, from tomorrow for about a couple of weeks.
&Quot; so_ and those kind of things.
Or, you know, if you have teenage, uh, kids, then they may have party, and they have_ usually have a general party, invite everybody in town.
And not only their friends.
So that everybody in a, town, if they want to come, come to the party.
And they find out they could check inside house and, investigate.
Or, you know, those repairmen, or those people casually you talked, tell burglars... That house_ you know, they are going to_  they'll be gone.
And that’s a target.
And the third target is, uh... Well, uh, it is ea- easy to open the door in garage.
And usually thieves are not so, you know, well equipped so that, uh, they could easily open with, uh, wi_ you know, wires.
Or, you know, with little tiny gadget, or coat hanger.
And people don’t think, uh_ we- so that important thing is, the door between garage and house, must be secured.
And people think, you know, their garage is protecting.
So that, usually, that door is, uh, not well, you know, locked or secured.
And, uh, next thing is, uh, don’t outdo your neighbors.
This is very interesting, because if _ it has a strange psychology that, they’re trying to make their house outstanding.
And, uh, makes more attractive, prettier.
And burglars usually select those, house.
I don’t know but, uh, they do.
So that you’re trying to, uh, make your house like, you know, your neighbors'.
And, uh, another thing.
Um, well... You know, today’s, uh, thieves would like to, uh, steal cash... Or jewelries, or drugs.
And little electric gadget.
So that, uh, ah, usually they_ as soon as they enter the hous- a house, they start looking for those things.
And, uh, then most people hide, those things in, main bedroom, living room... Or family room.
And so burglars look_ go into your main bedroom and look for it, living room look for it.
And usually they don’t look, children’s bedrooms, and basement, and utility, you know, room.
So that it’s safer, you know, leave your important things in, those safe places.
And also, uh, another thing is usually when you buy big appliance or electric gadget, and you carry big box... To walk in the house.
Then... Usually burglars select those houses.
And so that means... Don’t carry, don’t show you are carrying, you know, big new appliances in the house.
You just go into to dri- garage and, close the door, and then quietly unload it.
That’s safer.
And also, once you get robbed, usually it’s a tendency to get second rob- robbery, third robbery, fourth robbery happens in the same house.
Reason is, they have ve- very similar_ uh those,uh, i just stated those significancies attracting, uh, thieves.
And that’s why_ so, so once you get robbed then put security system, uh, on you house.
That’s probably the, uh, best way to avoid unfortunate events."
"I have... Two younger children who were born ten and eleven years, later than the two older children.
Uh... They were, much more independent from the very beginning.
Because i_ the reason i had them was_ it was a question of whether i would go to work or raise children.
And after they were born and they were, in school, i had enough staying home, and went back to work.
And so i didn't see a lot of what went on.
There were rules they knew not_ they didn't have company.
And they would_ the neighbors would check in them.
They knew all this_ all that was fine.
One day something very funny must have happened.
And i still don't understand what.
I have a beautiful statuette, of two flying, white horses trimmed in gold leaf.
It was it was beautiful.
It was sent to me by a friend.
And, uh, when i came home it wasn't standing in a place that was standing before.
And, i didn't know why.
And i asked them why.
And the answer was, &quot;oh i_ we must've moved it for something.
&Quot; they weren't sure at all why it was there.
And then years later i found out, and talked to them about it.
And i was right.
They have smashed that thing into about fifty pieces.
And, it's quite a job but they put it together like a puzzle with duco cement.
Which after ten years turned color.
And i could see all the cracks.
I've got it right here.
I can show you all the mess that was in that thing.
But i couldn't scold them for this ten years later.
How they managed to drop that statue from where it was i'm still, very curious about it all.
They could not have reached it originally.
So it makes me think they didn't follow all the rules as well as i thought they did.
Hehehe."
"I have a few things that i like to do for relaxation.
And one is, a hobby i have started.
And it started out with straw brooms and making arrangements on them for your doors.
Well i used_ then i started into hats and, baskets and now i do practically all my own_ a lot of handcraft things that i put together.
I don't put the flowers and things together myself.
I buy them.
And, the first time i had the experience of going to, one of these bazaars we have.
I didn't do so good.
I sold three things which didn't even amount to the cost of the table space i rented.
So i was a little bit discouraged.
And then my son said, &quot;mom, people walk by the house every day.
Why don't you put the thing outside on the front lawn, and sit there.
&Quot; well i did and low and behold the space didn't cost me a dime and i sold almost everything i had made.
But now here at Elm, Road we have bazaars in, the spring time.
And we have a rummage sale in the Fall.
And a Christmastime we have a bazaar.
And it was rather a small_ the first four years that i was here.
But this past Christmas bazaar was really, big.
And it was just for like, local tenants.
But being as we have expanded in such a, a big quantity of people, that our coming in now with their crafts.
That we are deciding possibly to extend it to the public a- and making it larger.
I, like to bake also.
That's another thing i like to do.
And i sold a lot of baked goods at our last bazaar.
But almost every_ as you walk down the hallway in Elm_ on Elm Road and the apartments that are here.
Anything that's ha- hanging outside of a person's door you can guarantee, Marge made it, or Sis made it whoever, you know.
And it's very relaxing, and once you put that first thing in that basket everything else comes natural.
I tried my hand at, water coloring and i like to doodle.
And i like to read, but mostly i think my main hobby is watching soap operas every day on TV."
"When it comes to food, I like anything salty especially salty and crunchy, and greasy.
That makes it really good.
A lot of people like sweets, like, donuts and cakes, but I don't like sweet food too much.
I like popcorn the best, and I like meat a lot.
Even though I know it's not good for you.
I could eat fried chicken, just tons of fried chicken, or, beef, rare beef dripping with blood and salt all over it.
I could_ but it gives me a stomach ache, but I like to eat it.
And the most unusual meat I ever ate was, uh, buffalo meat, and it was really good and it's very light too.
So, I also like to eat whole grains like, uh, rice and, bread whole-wheat bread that's just real_ uh, interesting texture to it.
So that's another thing I like to eat.
I don't like fruit very much, but I make myself eat it sometimes to be healthy.
Like grapes sometimes I'll eat, or a banana, or sometimes an orange or cherries.
But my favorite vegetables are broccoli,  and, cabbage I like, and I like kale, and I like, collard greens.
But they take a long time to cook.
You have to cook them for about a hour to get em right.
Um, what else do I like.
Tomatoes.
The best thing is a fresh tomato right off the vine.
When you eat when it's still warm.
It's so different from any kind of tomato you could buy in the grocery store.
So that's another good thing.
And, um... I think that's about it."
"I’ve written two books.
One got published, and one didn’t.
I could say i’ve learned a lot of lessons from doing this.
Probably the main lesson you ever learn is to do everything differently, than you’ve ever done it before.
And to make a whole lot, more mistakes that are different from the mistakes you’ve made already.
I’ve learned that you don’t make any money writing books.
I’ve learned that you don’t necessarily get your books published.
I’ve learned that when you do get them published nobody buys them.
But i haven’t stopped being interested in writing books.
And (hence), my book’s about football.
I wrote them because i was interested in football because i was interested in the consequences of football.
Because i had things to say about what football meant.
And about what was happening in football.
That i thought were, of interest, or importance.
And because i spent years writing about these things for magazines.
And people seemed to be interested.
And they seemed to think that i had something worthwhile to say.
So on the assumption that, people were interested I wrote a book about the nineteen-ninety-four world cup in the United States.
And I called it <em>The Best World Cup Money Can Buy</em>.
Which... Explains its whole message in just the title.
Um, about the commercialisation of football.
And I wrote this book and I sent it off to seventeen different publishers.
And most of them didn’t both to reply.
And those that did reply didn’t like it.
And so i’d spent, several months of my life completely wasting my time, writing a book that no one apparently was interested in.
Anyway I haven’t completely wasted it.
Because I decided to publish it myself.
And so I spent a couple of thousand pounds, getting it printed.
And I, managed to get it distributed in a very limited sense.
To a very small number of bookstores.
And I got it sent to a specialist football bookstore.
And I got it, sent to a specialist sports book club.
And it still sells today, four years on.
And, it sold about five hundred and fifty copies.
Which doesn’t sound like very many.
But believe me there are many books, uh, that don’t sell as many as five hundred fifty copies.
That's one of the first things you learn, after you started writing books.
Is how few people actually buy them.
And how few actually get sold.
Having done the first one though, I wrote a second one.
Which I called, <em>Moving the Goal Posts</em>.
Which was about the commercialisation of British football.
And this time I thought “i’m not going through all that again.
I’m not going to write one first and then not get it published a second.
&Quot;so this time i wrote, around for an agent.
And i found an agent who was interested in the idea.
And so i wrote a synopsis of the book.
Sent the synopsis to the agent.
And the agent took it to a couple of publishers.
And a publisher was interested.
And i signed a contract.
And they offered to pay me, a, uh, more than three thousand pounds for my book.
Which i was very pleased by.
And which kept me going for, uh, quite a while.
And i wrote the book.
And because i’m lazy i wrote it in three months.
Which were the three months before the deadline.
Four or five hours every night.
And i went on holiday.
And the book was published... Like a few months later.
It was published the day after i actually got re_ made redundant from my job.
Which was a bit symbolic.
I thought, “well this is the good Lord telling me that i need to write books rather than do my job in the, uh, N-H-S anymore.
&Quot; and, nine hundred people bought it.
And it was in all the bookshops.
And it got a lot of publicity.
I was on television twice to promote it.
I sat on a, a sofa at late night on channel four.
On one side of me was this woman Sharon Davies.
And on the other side of me was the footballer Bruce Grobbelaar.
I’m not as famous as them.
And i’m not going to get as famous as them.
Because nobody bought my book.
Well_ there you go.
I know as a result of that, that even if your book is published, and distributed, and publicised.
And you get on television to talk about.
Still nobody bu- buys your book.
And still it’s very unlikely anybody’s going to have any interest in it.
So next time i get 'round to writing a book.
I’m not going to give up my day job.
I’m still going to get a publisher beforehand.
And i’m going to have absolutely no expectations of it whatsoever.
And probably having done that, it’ll turn into a bestseller.
Or at least that’s what i’m crossing my fingers for.
Although to be honest i don’t believe a word of it."
"Okay i'm a feminist.
And sometimes when i ask people if they're are a feminist they say, &quot;oh no i'm not.
&Quot; uh, but that's just_ a lot of that_ the time they just don't, really know, uh, what feminism means.
And all it is, or wh- what feminists want the word feminism to mean, is a belief in equality for the sexes.
And, uh, most people, or a lot of people think that feminism means a group of angry men-hating women, which isn't true.
There is a group of angry men-hating women.
But, not all feminists are like that.
And the feminist movement wants to incorporate as many people, who believe in equality as possible, men, women.
If you think you might believe in equality for the sexes, then you are a feminist."
"Okay i'm going to talk about, what violin, what playing the violin added to my life.
Um, it added a couple of kind of obvious things.
I heard_ played played and heard a lot of beautiful music.
I met my_ some of my very best friends through playing violin, went to music camp you know.
When i played with the Philadelphia youth orchestra and, we went on tour, and i got to travel.
And it was really fun.
But... I'm not going to be a violinist professionally.
And i_ but i think that playing violin, just had a really, big impact on my life anyway.
For some reason i think that it made me smarter.
Um, it wa- was a really good thing for me to grow up with as a kid.
Um a, a really good kind of training .
Um, it trains your fingers.
But it, it also trained_ for me, uh, i learned how to, uh, listen much more carefully and hear if notes were right on tune or, just a just a tiny bit out of tune.
And i can tell when a professional musician is just a tiny bit out of tune.
So, um_ and i guess, just, playing music a lot, uh, especially you know the great composers like Mozart and Bach_ you know for some reason it's the kind of thing that when you study it, it's the kind of training that... Makes me smarter.
I don't know how to explain it.
But when i study this kind of music it just helps me."
"I buy my food at a, couple of different grocery stores.
When I need to buy, basic things like, cans of soup, or maybe a jar of vinegar, or some laundry detergent, I'll go to a big supermarket, that's close to where I work.
So I go into the supermarket.
Sometimes I have coupons, but sometimes I don't use them.
So I get mostly things that come in cans, like, coffee, and... Like I said soup.
And sometimes I get vegetables and fruits.
Oh, I get frozen vegetables there because they are cheaper.
I'll get a bag of frozen broccoli and a bag of carrots.
And, that's what I buy at the big grocery store.
But then there's a smaller store that sells, organic food and health food.
And it is a little bit more expensive but I like to go there sometimes.
Because they have fresh bread... Whole-wheat bread and bread made with grains and sesame seeds.
And it's really good and fresh.
I can also buy food in bulk there.
There will be a big container of rice.
They have all different kinds of rice, brown rice, short grain rice, long grain, basmati rice, all different kinds of rice.
So I'll fill a plastic bag with rice.
And, then I'll buy popcorn.
I'll buy_ I'll fill a, bag with popcorn kernels.
And sometimes I buy... Cashews and, sometimes_ oh I buy pasta there, out of the big barrels, whole-wheat pasta, and I fill a bag with that.
You can also get, wonderful olive oil there.
Not in jars, but it's in, big containers, and you... Tap like a beer keg or something.
You hold a jar underneath it, and they have the best olive oil there.
And it's worth paying a little bit more because it tastes good, and it's good for you.
So I get oil, and bread, and grains.
And then I go to the other section and buy, um, soap and shampoo and hair conditioner, and body lotion.
And then if I feel like spending a little bit more money, I got to another section and buy incense hehe.
They have everything at these stores, it's interesting.
So then I go... Pay for that, and like I said it's little bit more but it's worth it.
They also have good fresh fish there that, has not been frozen before.
So I might go and get a a mackerel sometimes, or a trout, or a catfish which I like.
And, sometimes I buy things at a fresh vegetable stand, if it's summer.
In New Jersey along the roads there's a lot of, farm markets set up, where you can buy fresh tomatoes and cantaloupes and water melons, and peaches and sometimes cherries.
Um, it used to be cheaper to buy food there but now it's not.
But it's still just fun to buy from those, from those road side stands.
So that's where I get my food."
"As a child i've_ i moved around a lot.
I was born in Maryland.
And then i moved to... Um, Delaware when i was two years old.
And then, when i was six years old, i moved back to Maryland.
And i started first grade there.
And, i went first through fourth grade in Maryland.
And then i moved to Pennsylvania.
And, i, i lived there from fifth grade sixth grade, and then part of seventh grade.
And then i moved all the way across the country to the west coast, in sunny California.
And i stayed there, all the way through my junior year in high school, which is eleventh grade.
And then, very unexpectedly we moved to, Princeton New Jersey, which is clear across the country, back again on east coast.
And i have been living there ever since.
Two years now.
And... The cool thing about moving is i've made a lot of friends, and it's taught me to be very social.
And, i have a best friend in Pennsylvania, a best friend in Maryland and a best friend in California.
So you make a lot of friends when you move."
"I think when I was a young girl, a cousin of mine, was a navy nurse and when she was, off duty she would come out and visit us.
And spend a week with us and tell us all about her travels, on board ship as a navy nurse.
And then we had another cousin who was also a nurse.
And, um, she worked in an orphanage... And it was really fascinating, the different tales that these women would, bring back to us.
There're five girls in my family and three boys.
And of course the girls were always fascinated with all these stories and, actually their_ they both were a great inspiration to all of us because three of us in the family became registered nurses.
We went to university and became registered nurses.
And we all practised nursing for years.
Hehehe.
As a matter of fact my youngest sis- one of my youngest sisters who lives near here is still practising nursing.
She is now working with the, uh, drug abuse program up the_ the medical center nearby.
And she's in her seventies.
So the type of nursing i do now_ i'm_ i'm_ i'm just sort of digressing here a bit.
I'm sort of nurse companion and, uh, listener and all that sort of stuff.
And sometimes i help with treatments if they can't get mi- minor treatments.
But, um, my oldest sister was the one who first became a nurse.
And she went off the college right out of, uh, high school.
So, uh, i didn't know what i wanted to do.
As i said there were so many of us in the family, there there was just enou- not enough money for us all to go off to school when we finished high school.
So anyway, she was in her, second or last year of training when i finished high school.
And there just wasn't enough money for me to go off and i just didn't know what i wanted to do so my dad... Asked me to stay home and help him in the orchard business.
At that time he was, uh, in the orchard business full time.
He had been a county superintendent of schools.
And when i was a junior in high school he had to give up that job_ that work, because it was affecting his health, it was too much stress.
So he, um, expanded the orchard and then because my_ both my brothers were in college at the time, i was sort of his main stay.
We had the sales room and all that.
And we had the care of the trees all the year round.
So... I became rather_ i would say very knowledgeable about the orchard work, uh, a- and different types of fruit that we were raising.
But, uh, as a result of my staying home he paid my tuition to, the nursing school.
Which i was very happy he did because i didn't know how i was going to do it.
But, um, so i went to the same school, same college, the University College sat, uh, i- in Cincinnati, Ohio, the university there.
And our, uh, training hospital was the huge Cincinnati General Hospital, the big City hospital.
So we had the medical school down the street from us.
We had the Children's Hospital_ the City of Children's Hospital, then we had a private_ a small private hospital.
All within two or three blocks radius.
And then we had_  this was a fifteen hundred bed hospital... With patients.
And then we had, two buildings where_ with three stories where they did medical research.
So it was just a_ an exciting, fascinating, training period of my life.
Then i stayed there a couple of years after i graduated.
And then i got married and moved out because, um, my husband was drafted into the army during the second world war.
But i still continued to work where we moved before he was drafted.
And that's another_ and this again was a very interesting experience.
Because it was another medical school setting.
But it was interesting, th- the men and the women's colleges_ the university pa- uh, parts were separated.
So if i wanted to continue my studies i had to go all the way downtown to the women's campus, after i got off duty.
Which i did because i wanted to further my education.
I_ my husband didn't want me to go in the army so i said &quot;well i might as well do something worthwhile&quot;. "
" I'm a student from Hanoi, Vietnam.
And I've been in America for ten days now.
I'm here to do a graduate's degree in politics.
Um, the reason why I chose politics_ it's, um, a little bit very... Uh, sentimental.
I just, um,  thought that maybe one day I would like to do something good for the people of my country.
And, even though politics has a, kind of negative reputation around the world, but there are still very good politicians.
So I decided that politics may be the best path for me, if I want to do something to contribute to the happiness of my people back in Vietnam.
Um, one of the reasons that I decided to choose Princeton, is because, um, a friend of mine, um, is a Princeton man.
That means he used to study at Princeton, and he had a degree from Princeton.
He told me about the program at Woodrow Wilson school at Princeton, which is a very famous school for, public affairs for international relations and politics in general.
So I decided to apply, and now I'm here in America waiting to start my first year.
The program is going to last  two years.
And I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot, and meet a lot of people, and make a lot of new friends.
And there are 60 people in my class.
Most of them are from America.
But, quite a few of them are from other countries like myself.
There are two students from India, uh, two students from Mexico, one from Finland, and I'm the only one from Vietnam.
I don't think I won't be lonely here, ev-  even though um I'm the only Vietnamese in the class.
I'm sure I will make a lot of new friends. "
"So, horse riding.
And i think i started, uh, when i was six.
And, um, it was actually my father who, suggested that i, i should do something.
And, he, he just said, 'why not horse riding.
' Ahem, and i said, 'well why not.
' Uh, i was interested in it.
I was open to anything.
And i started with my older sister, but in the end she didn't like it.
She was a bit afraid i think.
But i was quite a confident child and, uh, i went for it.
Just, um, i went for it.
And, um, i like it very much.
Although i fell a few_ well, many times actually.
But, uh, yes i think, i, am quite happy to have started so young.
Because you get u_ you learn it more easily.
And, you grow up with it.
So, it's hard to explain.
You get sort of feeling.
You get to know, the horses, much better.
I don't think_ if i had started now, that i would have_ get the same feelings, with horses.
The same, um, it's not infin_ affinity that you have.
But, hehe, yeah, you sort of understand each other.
And, i like it very much.
It's all about communication and about intuition.
You... You, you, um, you pay attention to the body language.
And, the muscle tensions.
And all these little things.
And, you, you are more aware of your own body too.
Because, it's like a body communication.
Not all_ not only.
But, i mean you communicate with a voice.
He doesn't understand the words of course.
But he understands, the rhythm in your voice.
Um, if it's a high pitched sound, or a high pitched voice, or a low pitched.
What, he understands what you mean.
And if you_ if you're angry you tend t- to speak loud, and quick and so on.
So he understands it very well.
And it think, horses, um, can read on your face.
You know, the expressions.
Very subt- subtle expressions.
They can, read it very well.
And, between them they, they communicate with body language.
And it's very interesting.
I'd like to know a bit more about it, to communicate with them better.
Yeah.
And, um, i'm not so interested in competing and doing show jumping or_ it would- it would be nice i'm sure but it's not, my, my first priority really when i'm riding.
It's more, getting to kno- know the horse.
I'd love to have a, a horse of mine actually.
And to, to, rear him up.
So i would buy it, young... As a foal maybe, don't know.
That's a bit of a dream of mine.
Maybe, maybe once i- i'm a bit richer.
When i can afford it.
He-he.
I'd_ i would run for it i think.
Yeah.
I'd love it.
But now i'm just focusing on, on, riding a horse quite regularly.
So, you can get to know him or her better.
And communicate, truly.
And, something fun like that."
"This is why i like living in New Jersey.
New Jersey is about sixty percent undeveloped.
Which means we have the Pine Barrens, and we have, what they call the Horse Country.
We have, beautiful areas that look like, parts of the English countryside.
And, we have New York and Philadelphia just like a hour away.
So it's, the best of both worlds.
But the other thing that makes New Jersey interesting is we have the most ethnic diversity of any state, in the union.
Just, in one weekend, i could go, to a Tibetan Buddhism Tibetan Buddhist _ like chanting.
Actually i know two or three different places for that.
There's a Dorga temple in Kingston which is uh, Hinduism.
There is a Sufi center... What else.
There's just about every religion you could think of in New Jersey, and every ethnic background.
So that makes it interesting to me."
"I loved living in California.
It was so_ it was so much fun and it was so wonderful.
And the weather was great all year round.
Like ninety-nine percent of the time, it was sunny out, no clouds in the sky.
Where, where we were, we were a beach community.
So we got, the sea breeze and it was like seventy-five degrees maybe eighty degrees.
You could wear shorts, year round.
It wasn't that humid, eh, maybe like twenty percent humidity, max thirty percent.
It was always sunny.
And everybody was always smiling.
Um, there's a lot of, uh_ i guess, free people, you could say.
We we lived where there's a lot of surfers.
And that's always an interesting culture.
We lived right by, this place called Laguna Beach, which is a, real artsy community in southern California.
And... They have, just the wackiest people there, but everybody is so cool.
And_  in California.
And there's so much to do there.
There's Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain and, uh, the San Diego Zoo, the Wild Animal Park, and every single beach.
There's so many, there's so many attractions there.
And i think that's why a lot of people vacation there.
But it's also a great place to live.
Uh, there's a lot of traffic, and there's a lot of smog.
There's definitely downfalls living in California.
Houses are, horrendously expensive.
But, i think it's worth it.
And i think everybody should... Should visit it, so they know it's not_ there's_ oh, there's a lot more in California besides beaches, and a lot people overlook that.
There's deserts and there's mountains and there's, there's forests.
And that's what's so great about living in southern California.
Is you can travel to any season you want to.
You can surf in the morning, and then go skiing in the, in the afternoon.
And, uh, that's what's so wonderful about California, is the different climates and different atmospheres."
"Why do I paint.
Well, that's a very hard question to answer.
But, i paint, because... I enjoy it.
And... Because i find, a great sort of... Satisfaction in, um, producing, something from nothing.
Um, and i paint also as a form of therapy.
To, alleviate my, thoughts and get them down.
I learn a lot about myself, by painting.
By thinking, and by putting marks down on a piece of paper or... Canvas, or something.
Um, i suppose it's a- an emotional experience to go through.
I can't just suddenly pick up a paintbrush and paint.
It takes, maybe_ sometimes, half a day to get me in the mood.
Um, other times not, um... So, it's not really just like sitting down and reading a book.
It's_ it involves, feeling, right at the time.
But, why i paint is... A hard one to, to sort of pinpoint.
But i, i love it and_ as a sort of emotional passion, um."
"I started painting because I was with a girlfriend at the time who was an artist.
Excuse me.
She'd just finished at the Ruskin which is some posh Oxford college.
Um, and you have to be fair- a fairly good artist to get in.
Um, well she was doing lots of painting anyway.
So I thought I'd take it up.
I think I once read something, somewhere that said, somebody, h- had thought it was once a good idea to, do a little bit of everything.
And, um, meaning, uh, it's good to work with your hands.
It's good to paint.
It's good to think.
It's good to write because I -it all builds up a different side to you.
Um, so I'd started painting.
Um, and she was very encouraging.
And, I found that I enjoyed it.
Although I obviously wasn't very good to start off.
Um, but that comes with practice.
And then I found that I got much better.
And then I got to the point where I was doing portrait, and things like that.
I haven't_ I've not tried it o- on a commercial basis.
I've not tried to make a living out of it.
As I have done with, pretty much most things that I like doing.
Um, but I'm_ I'd like to build up a portfolio.
That's something that I can show people that would be interested in, paying me to paint for them.
And, that's something I tried to put together, not so many years ago.
Uh, but something happened.
I think the paintings got damp, or, some such story.
And so I just, left that alone.
Something I found with painting, though_ at the end of the day.
Is you can start off doing a painting and take it so far.
And then you don't know when to stop.
And part of being a painter is knowing, when to stop.
And when not to overdo the detail.
Because then it's considered messy."
" I'm going to talk about why I want to, be a teacher, specifically a math teacher.
Um, at first, I really didn't plan on going to college for teaching.
I went, uh,  to college, to study architecture, uh, after realizing that's not, something that I wanted to get involved with.
Uh I tried to find another area, another field that I'd be interested in.
And teaching_ I i kind of stumbled onto it.
Um, when I was at Penn State, i, uh, helped out with the local high school near the university, and worked with the, the high school kids.
And tutored every now and then, and just, uh, worked in the high school environment.
And the more I thought about it the more the teaching seem like a natural thing for me to do.
Um, uh, so I began taking classes studying to be a teacher and, and, uh, see if I enjoyed it or not.
And, the more involved I became, the more I realized that's really what I wanted to do.
So now, I'm going to a, a college where teaching is, its, main, major, and, hopefully, uh, I'll get a job as soon as I'm out of college.
Uh the main reasons why I want to be a teacher, uh, i... I would have to say would be_ well one of the main reasons would be, uh, just the satisfaction of... Revealing new information to, uh, someone else not just a child, but someone else, another person.
Uh, when you know that you can_ you're the teacher, and you're the person that's showing them something they've never seen before it's, it's a very neat experience.
And it's, uh, just even one person to get through to them, is worth having thirty people_ and <laughs> or depending on the class size.
Um, so my whole... My whole... Inspiration would be just t,  try to get through to as many people as I can.
Um, why math.
Well cuz that was the subject I enjoyed a lot in high school.
And there's many reasons for that.
And_ which I won't get involved with right now.
Um, also other... Other perks for being a teacher you can think about it.
You have the summers off, and then, you have weekends off.
Uh, so those are things that you might not think of at first, but they go along with it.
Um, how many times do you get to just sit in the classroom for the rest of your life.
This will be the only occupation that you can do that.
So, some people say that you are not really getting out into the real world.
But I guess, that depends on what kind of philosophy you have.
Um, all those things really draw me towards teaching.
Most importantly just, uh, being able to try to communicate another language to someone else.
Or_ which would be mathematics for me.
Uh that would be the most important thing.
And hopefully I'll be able to do that with success. "
"I'm a vegetarian, and I became a vegetarian about 6 years ago.
Um ... It all started when I watched a television program after school, that talked about this vegetarian girl, uh, something about how in science class she had to dissect an animal, and she really didn't want to.
And, she refused, and therefore got a D.
Um, and she took this ... She and her parents took this problem to the courts.
And they ended up ruling in her favor, so now schools have to provide an alternative, um ... For dissection in science classes.
Um, but that just got ... Got me started thinking about, where meat comes from and if I really wanted to eat it or not.
And that night for dinner I had a, cheese steak.
Um, and after I'd eaten it,  I thought about it, and made me feel really bad.
Um, not physically sick but I just ... I knew that it wasn't right for me.
And, uh, so I decided never to eat meat again.
So I didn't.
And I guess my reasons are just that, I don't think it's necessary for me to kill animals.
So I'd ... I'd rather save more animals."
"I'm also interested in theology.
Because I came to Oxford to study theology as a mature student.
And I still organise, uh, women's theology seminars at one of the colleges during term time.
Um, this is as, um, an addition to the basic curriculum.
It's, uh, an extra interest for people in the evening.
So it's not part of the university course.
Although it has the support of one of the, university colleges.
And we us- usually meet three, meetings, um, a term.
Um, every other week, during term time.
And, um, we look up various topics affecting women in church and society.
Um, sometimes we look at, uh, women in different traditions other than the Christian traditions.
So we- we've had various women Rabbis for instance come and speak.
We've had people come and speak about women in Islam, and in Hinduism, and in Buddhism.
And, from_ because in Oxford_ is such a rich place, there's so many people from different, um, backgrounds and experiences.
You can always find someone to come and talk on any topic.
Um, we also sometimes have some well-known speakers.
Like, uh, this year we had, um, Margaret Hebblethwaite coming to talk.
Um, on, um, and she's a well-known writer and broadcaster.
And, uh, she gave a talk on, one of our, our seminars.
And then we also have had, um_ for instance, um, like the last one was, someone who works in the area of spirituality and psychotherapy.
We always find, um, these topics very popular actually.
Whenever we have anyone who's working in psychotherapy which, I tend to do every so often.
Uh, hehe, we seem to get double the numbers.
Which is quite amusing, hehe.
Um, whether that says something about Oxford, hehe, I don't know.
Hehe.
Um, we also have, um, uh, uh, people who may be ministers in different, um, traditions.
Like we've had, um, women ministers from the United Reform Church.
Um, from the_ um, and women chaplains from the different colleges.
'Cause, uh, here in Oxford, uh, we now have a number of women chaplains, uh, to the different colleges, which is very good.
And, um, we also look at, um, uh, women perhaps, um, from the past as well.
Who've, um, fi- figured prominently and, helped the struggle for emancipation of women in church and society.
And_ so there's quite a wide range of topics can be covered.
And, um, because tha- now there is quite an interest in, um, f- feminist theology.
In fact today it ha- has even now become more mainstream.
Because now there are actually some courses, uh, run at, uh, June term time, uh, in the university lectures.
And this is quite a recent development.
Only in the last couple, uh, two or three years I think, that this has happened.
Um, when I first came to Oxford there was definitely nothing like that at all.
And it was only groups like ours, which had been going actually now for about, twelve years probably.
Um, where women were able to go along_ not just women, cause men_ also women and men, come along together who have been interested in, looking at, um, these ideas and and, uh, pursuing this kind of study.
But, thankfully now it is becoming more mainstream and it being integrated into the curric_ into the curriculum."
"I once rented out a house, a couple of years ago.
And some of my friends lived there.
And they'd pay me rent.
And that would help me to pay, pay, pay off the entire, sort of rent th- that was_ that I had to pay.
Um, I ran a classic car restoration business from, from, from that house, as well.
And, um, I had a garage.
And one of the people that lived there, Mike.
Wou- would_ he was a mechanic.
And he'd do the work on the cars for me.
Sometimes I'd help him.
He'd sort of t- tell me about, what problems he'd had, and what he needed.
What tools.
That sort of thing.
And I'd sort of do that.
And, it was a bit naughty.
But sometimes I'd do that when I had Zach as well.
Ordinarily I make the effort to just, be with him.
And do the things he wants to do.
And, and I try and do my work when I don't have him.
But on this occasion I was, sort of_ we were talking about something.
Mike and i.
And Zach was_ Zach came up and he started pulling my hand, 'i want to do some drawing.
I want to do some drawing.
' And I remember saying to him, 'Zach, look not now.
' And then, stopping and thinking, 'oh, this is all wrong.
' And, I turned round to Mike and said, 'Mike it will have to wait.
' An- and that was okay, because he was working for me.
You know uh, uh.
So that was that.
And, um, I asked Zach what he wanted to do.
And, uh, he said he wanted to put up a sign outside the house that said, 'no big bad wolves were allowed in.
' Because, I think he'd just read a story.
Tha_ wh- what's that story.
Um, The Three Little Piggies, where they get eaten up by a, i_ an itinerant wolf.
Um, we had a bus stop outside the house as well.
So we made up this sign, with one word, uh, on the_ on a piece A4 paper.
And we had about eight, eight pieces or something.
And we stuck them on this front wall outside the house.
And it said, 'no big bad wolves allowed here.
' And, and Zach had decided this was the sentence that he wanted.
So we stuck that outside the house.
And I remember that that these, hehe, persons would just pull up, and stop.
And all of, hehe, these people would, sort of, read the sign and think, 'what.
' Um, and the sign stayed up there for a good week.
I think ten days before it finally came down.
Um, that says it all really about my household."
"I've had quite a few different casual, jobs.
And one that was, quite interesting, um, was working in the National Gallery, in London.
Which is on Trafalgar Square.
It involved, basically, uh, handing out the audio guide machines.
So that people could go around, and listen to the paintings.
It was like a CD-ROM.
And... It involved standing up all day and saying the same thing, all the time.
And it was_ but it_ what was interesting was to meet, um, all the different types of people that came in.
Mainly they were tourists.
Um, but we did get some, sort of rather bizarre, English characters.
Um... You could've written a novel about the sort of people that came in.
Um, and it was obviously very interesting to work with, with art, and, just sort of, view it at any time."
"Okay, well i've got this job that I really don't like.
And it's working in a clothes shop.
Um, about two days a week.
I used to do it full-time.
But I think I went a bit crazy doing that.
Um, so, basically it's_ I work in a very upmarket women's clothes shop.
Which, um, sell very nice shoes made in Italy.
And, very well tailored, clothes.
Mainly for, women of about, thirty to fifty years old.
My duties involve basic selling.
And, um, getting the shoes for the customer.
And, some cleaning duties.
You know, um, cashing and, cashing up.
And, doing very_ to what i, find, quite mundane type of activities.
But... And it's quite a sort of upmarket clothes shop.
So it does en- entail looking smart.
And being very, very polite.
And, um, customer service skills are obviously, um, of prime importance here."
"This summer I went to, Italy for what turned to be a three week trip with a friend of mine from college.
It was a really a good experience.
I have never been out of the country before and, for years I wanted to go.
I had always wanted to go on a exchange when I was in college but I couldn't afford it.
And, you know, finally, you know, I graduated from school and i, I decided that I was just going to throw all my money into this trip to to Europe.
And it, it was definitely worth it.
Um, I don't think I could have made a better decision as far as that was concerned.
Um, we flew into Rome, and we, were going to be meeting up with the tour on our third day there, so we had a little bit of leeway where we were just going to, kind of, show ourselves around.
And, at first it was bit overwhelming.
We landed in a_ the airport in Rome.
And it was just another world immediately, I mean, the chaos there was just out of this world, I mean.
We had had a layover in Heathrow on the way there, and everything in England was just so organized, and so_ and everybody was so cordial.
And, then all of a sudden we were in Rome and it was just like_ everyone was pushing these metal carts to pick up their suitcases, but they were all going in opposite directions and they were just kind of getting into all these traffic jaMs  and_ I mean... I don't know what I expected, hehehe.
I think I was expecting that everything would have English subtitles underneath it or something.
So I felt I this sort of like this barbarian coming over there like, ""where's my language.""  you know, and, I didn't- I didn't understand Italian.
I 'd taken a year of it at high school, at one point, and that was the extent of my experience.
And i'd also been told that Spanish is very similar to Italian.
So I was, I was expecting that, you know, I would be able to, interpret what was going on just based on my knowledge of Spanish.
Because i, you know, I felt like I had some pretty extensive knowledge of Spanish.
But uh... It didn't really work out that way.
Um... The friend that I was with, really didn't know any Italian either.
And it took us, I would say, about two hours to just get ourselves out of the airport, get our luggage, and get on the proper, bus that was going to take us to our hotel.
I mean it was it was definitely a crazy crazy arrival time.
And... I don't know as as we, you know, spent more time there, we got more and more used to the way that things worked.
Um, we, had a big hassle with public transportation on our first day, where we decided to take a bus into town.
And, uh, we didn't know where to get off the bus.
Again I don't know what we were expecting.
I guess we were expecting somebody to like hold up an English sign and say, ""Debbie and Christine, you can get off the bus now.""  but, uh, of course, you know, that didn't happen.
And, you know, we ended up just riding around on this bus endlessly.
And we kept trying to ask people questions and_ you know, in broken Spanish slash English Italian and it, you know, it wasn't turning out too well for us.
Finally we ran into an exchange student and he helped us.
He got us off the bus at the right stop and, pointed us in the proper direction.
But it was, it was really you know, really quite chaotic.
And of course ra- Rome is a really, really manic city, I mean, just the traffic is completely insane.
I mean there's traffic rules but, people just kind of consider them to be, you know, optional I guess.
So here we are stumbling around the city, all jet-lagged.
And, you know, there's ten thousand mopeds, everywhere.
I mean... Uh, I think you can get a license when you're like fourteen to drive a moped.
They have all these half crazed kids driving around on mopeds.
And, you know, they don't care.
You can be in the middle of the street, they'll just mow you on down.
So... You know, it's definitely a far cry from, Princeton where the pedestrians all have the right of the way.
I'm just stumbling out in the middle of the street thinking that people are gonna, you know, let me let me pass.
Bu, you know, people were just narrowly missing me with their, vehicles.
So that, that was an interesting little introduction into the, the ways of Italy.
But uh... Actually while we were there, we wound up covering a lot of territory.
We spend about... Three days in Rome at first and then we, we moved onto, uh, Florence which I actually liked a lot more than Rome.
Um, it's a beautiful city.
We were there for, about three days.
Um... The tour that we were on was very fast-paced which was one thing that I think I would change if I went back.
I would like to do things, you know, according to when I want to do them and, not according to, you know, when this group of people tells me to... You know, move on to the next place.
Because, in a lot of cases I felt we didn't really get to absorb everything there was to get absorb in a certain city.
We were always just piled back on the tour bus and taken to the next place.
We covered a lot of territory, but... Sometimes we just felt like we were running past things, which was a kind of crazy.
And I think I also found a lot of people on our tour group to be rather embarrassing.
Like, I felt just they should just just gotten shipped straight to Fort Lauderdale.
Huh, and you know, they seemed to have a primary interest in just getting drunk in a hotel bar and like, hooking up with each other.
And, nobody really, nobody really had any cultural interest in being in Europe.
You know, I felt like Europe was waste,d on them in a way.
So I guess I was being sort of, you know, elitist about that.
But um, it was it was kind of weird being thrown together with a random group of people.
Um... And it was, it was a... A tour that was designed primarily for young people.
It was very cheap.
And they had us staying in hostels and in really, you know, inexpensive hotels.
So the people on the tour were all, under the age of thirty and, you know, some of them were acting like they were under the age of fifteen.
So, hehe, it was definitely, it was definitely an interesting experience, as far as they were all concerned.
But_ but it, it was definitely wonderful to be over in Europe.
I... Unfortunately I felt that, I wasn't there that long enough to really, to see everything that I wanted to see.
I mean... I think that, it was just long enough for me to feel like, ""okay now i'm ready to stay"" now_ I was really settled in then it was like, ""okay time to load your stuff back on the plane and go back home.""  so that was a little bit_ a little frustrating for me.
And, the other frustrating thing was, uhm, we stopped in England on the way back.
And, i've always wanted to go to England.
I wanted to go on exchange there when I was in, in college and I didn't get to.
So of course like passing through England for me was like, you know, dangling a carrot in front of my face and then saying ""you can't have it.""  so it was, it was really rough, you know, we we had our big hour layover in England and i, like, couldn't even see outside the airport and I just really wanted to_ I really wanted to just, you know, go around and see something.
And I was actually hoping we would miss our flight.
Because we almost did.
We missed our flight from Rome, to Heathrow on the way home.
And they had to book us on a later flight.
And... As a result they were thinking we might miss our connecting flight.
So I was all psyched up for this, and I was like, ""yeah we're going to be stuck in England for, you know, a couple of days.
This'll be great, you know, we'll just have to, just have to bear it, you know.""  but the girl I was with was all frantic, you know, she really wanted to get back and, they wound up like, providing a special little tram service to whip us off to our next flight, and, we didn't miss it after all.
But, it was a really nice trip.
I, definitely hope I can go back, if I can, you know, save enough money this year.
That's another thing that I hope I can do.
Huh, there are so many things I want to do and I can't afford them.
That's the problem.
But... It was a good trip."
"Sometime earlier this year i took a trip to, England and France.
Uh, my family helped me out.
Uh... Because i wanted to go see some friends in France.
And i also had three people that i went to school with at Oxford.
Now, it was a wonderful trip, i really loved it.
Uh... But one thing that struck me... Was how different_ i guess, i guess this would strike anyone_ uh, whene- whenever they travel, is how different cultures are... Uh from your own.
Not just how different they are but how similar, but th- i suppose it is the differences that really stand out.
Uh... One of the things that, struck me very much was the difference in attitudes towards smoking.
There is_ as uh_ as, many people know there's a, a growing antismoking sentiment in this country.
And, you see smokers huddled out- outside of their office buildings, in front of doors, with their cigarettes in their hands and, shuddering.
Uh keeping_ wrapping their coats close about them shuddering and, getting a drag off a cigarette.
And, almost embarrassed, al- almost like they are fixers of, uh, illegal drugs.
And uh.
I al- i, i feel sorry for them in a way, but i don't like smoking personally.
So i don't feel too sorry for them.
However when i went to, England and France, i got a new perspective, on this issue.
Uh... To be blunt, people in Europe smoke like chimneys.
In my point of view, from what i could see.
There are antismoking signs all over the place, but no one seems to pay, much attention to them.
Uh... Uh, people seem to smoke anywhere and everywhere, and even though there's antismoking campaigns.
In fact, uh, when i was in England there was controversy, that i heard several times over the radio about, a member of the world cup team, the world cup soccer team, who smoked.
And people were actually saying, &quot;well he shouldn't be on the team because he's a bad example for our children.
&Quot; well i think, if they want to look at bad examples for their children with smoking, they should just go out on the street, or go into the subways, or look in the mirror, even, because so many of them are smoking in very inappropriate places.
I went to a Chinese restaurant in London, the food was very bad but that's beside the point, and they had a buffet.
Uh, they had a buffet in which people could take whatever_ take what they wanted for a certain price.
And there was this one woman, uh, this one English woman who ,uh, had her cigarette in her hand, lit cigarette.
And she was blowing smoke, and holding her cigarette directly over the buffet food.
And... I was appalled, that this would even be allowed.
I thought, in America this person would be kicked out at a moments_ you know would be kicked out, immediately.
Ah... And, the, the other Americans at the table were really appalled too.
And actually when i talked to an English person later, they, they were pretty appalled too.
And they said that's even ru- that's rude for even British standards.
But.. It didn't just, give me_ it didn't just make me... Feel that the, the Europeans are bad.
And, uh, it just, it didn't just have a negative effect.
It almost_ it also had conversely a positive effect on my attitudes toward American smokers.
There are a lot of American smokers who... Have attitudes, and, you know, they will uh... You know, they will proclaim their right to smoke whenever they want, and they will ch- they will chafe, they will complain about antismoking rules.
But, they will follow the rules, generally.
If they cannot smoke in a s- in a public building.
If the law_ if there is an_ no smoking sign, they will go outside.
And they will not smoke where they are asked not to smoke.
And, in general they do... Have consideration for other peo- for nonsmokers.
They will ask &quot;can i smoke.
&Quot; whereas it seems to me at least in Europe that people, just smoked.
They didn't ask for permission or anything.
So this experience in Europe gave me more of a respect, for... For people who smoke in this country, even though i still don't like smoking.
I respect the fact, that they_ that even when they do_ when they do smoke they follow the rules, and try to respect other people's feelings."
"I would definitely say that tennis is my favorite sport.
Uh, my parents both played it, played in college.
My mom's really into it, and she plays tennis about three times a week at least.
Plays with the team.
And she always has some kind of story about the ladies that she plays with.
And, uh, she goes down to Florida and stuff like that.
Has a great time.
But she kind of, uh, basically gave a racket to me and my brother, made us kind of start playing when i was around five years old.
I've been playing since then.
Uh, she started_ she taught us at first, and then, the same uh_ i had a_ ... We went to a swim club called Minisink and the pro there turned out to be my high school teacher.
And, uh, so i knew him for like so long.
And he was the same pro_ he's actually the same coach for the men's team at high school.
And so, uh, he taught me basically everything I know.
And i think he's a great guy, but some people have problems with him.
But i would play_ played for some high school matches.
I played, uh, Minisink matches.
But, i played_ like the whole idea is you want to play tournaments that you get, points.
And you get like a ranking.
And you play a certain amount of tournaments a year.
So one year, i decided that i would try to do that.
So, i started playing some tournaments.
And i played my first tournament, and i kicked butt in the first round.
I won six one, six one.
And then i got whooped the second round, and lost six zero, six zero.
But that's okay.
I still felt pretty good because i lost_ if you lose to people who are better than you, it really doesn't really matter, cuz, they might have been playing for twice as long as you.
Some people play it for half as long as you, and still a lot better than you.
But i mean, what can you do.
If you've played the best you can, it doesn't really matter.
But, uh, the thing is, uh_ i had to play three tournaments a year.
And, uh, i played one tournament and i lost the second round, like i said.
And then i was gonna play a second tournament.
So i signed up for it, and it was in some place about half hour away form my home.
And i got there, and it turned out i was only, the second person signed up for the entire tournament.
And so there_ the people who ran it were like, &quot;do you even want to bother playing the tournament.
&Quot; and i was like_ &quot;well this is a great opportunity, because if i win then i've won a tournament only with one match.
So i can beat one guy, and even if i don't, like who cares.
&Quot; so_ and_ cuz you get points for, where you finish.
So a runner-up gets the points anyway.
So i was kind of hoping that the other guy i was gonna playing against, was gonna dropout,and just give me the trophy.
But he didn't.
So, anyway we went out and played, and we didn't even start_ we started like way after, because i got there for a seven o'clock match.
We didn't start playing until like ten at night.
It was ridiculous.
So, uh, we got out there, and i realized that this guy was a lot better than me.
So it probably like  hurt my whole mental angle on the match.
So basically he whipped my butt.
I think it was six two, six one.
And that was it, it was probably over in less than an hour.
But i mean who cares, cuz i got my_  i got a little runner-up trophy.
I got points to be on the U-S-T-A.
And the part of that_ they have like a ranking.
I think now.
I'm probably really in the thousand billionth, or something like that.
That's pretty good.
And, it was a lot of fun, even though i didn't win anything."
"Um, generally i, I have found with my studies that, um, historians as a sort of breed of academic.
Were particularly conservative in their sort of, um, outlook.
Um, perhaps... Tendency, um, and I don’t know, i, I felt talking to other friends and, sort of getting a, a,  knowledge of the way other degrees are, and the way, um, courses are organised, that it was a more general problem.
Um, even in you know, subjects which might seem more, uh, more inclined to be direct and contemporary and relevant.
Like, um, politics or economics.
That, um, there was a sort of... Tendency of universities in, in Britain to be conservative.
Um... Partly I think, it is the sort of inbuilt nature of any institution, um, to_ there is a tendency to ossify and unless there's forces for, um, change which stir things up and move on a bit.
It, it can tend to stick.
Um, I think in Britain you have a particular problem with, uh, certain universities, Oxford and Cambridge most notably, are known to be good, and known to be old and are presumed that, um, well this is the way things_ they are.
We have always taught this way.
That the course has always been like this and that we should stick with the, the way things are.
And that, um, there is a terrible difficulty to sort of integrate, um, intellectual advances.
Um, I think it is particularly bad in, in Oxford as a university.
Cambridge has always had a, a slightly better, um, reputation for, um, being advanced.
Its_ as I say it is particularly bad in, in certain subjects, it seems to me.
I think it is my misfortune to have done history.
In that it, it is one of the more conservative ones.
But even in a subject like English literature, um, you would have an undergraduate degree in Ox_ in Oxford, um, hugely based on sort of, taking courses in Yates and Elliot.
And then you have after the whole three years, um, you, you have six weeks doing literary theory.
And i- in this you are supposed to encompass, you know the... Basically the sort of intellectual history of the last thirty years.
Um, and the rest of the time you are dealing with the texts of, of Yates, Elliott, Milton, you know, Shakespeare in a sort of workman like, common sense, uh, analysis.
And, um, really this_ i, it doesn’t seem to me to reflect, um, a lot of the sort of scholarship that might be, going on in, um, America or France, or, or elsewhere or_ certainly in Britain.
It doesn’t, in a way, reflect, um, what the people who'd be regarded as, as the, um, uh, leading, um, authors.
People like Terry Eagleton and, um, Anthony Easthope, and um, what not.
It doesn’t really reflect the sort of things that they're writing about.
Um, so it’s, it, it does seem unfortunate.
And in, in a way the un- the universities that are new and, you know, where there is a dynamic for change.
Um, it is very interesting that, that what used to be called the polytechnics which is about half the universities in Britain, that were set up in the 1960’s.
They're, um, they're obviously much more open to, to, um, changing their curriculum and, incorporating new ideas and, the sort of what's the discipline o- of what is now called cultural studies.
Um, most of the polytechnics have a department of cultural studies.
Where as in the, the older universities sort of_ that some of the most_ um, in the newer universities, um, oh sorry.
In the older universities, um, sort of cultural studies is done by the sort of back door in departments of sociology and departments of English.
And, um, it, it is sort of, almost absurd in the way you, uh, could go to Oxford and you, you, you couldn’t almost directly study, um, the way the media works, how media texts work, how film works.
Um, yet, so much of, of contemporary culture is, is, is in those formats.
And that you have to do it by a back door through, you know, reading the, the works of, um, people who are in English departments and supposedly doing English literature.
Um, and it, it can be, sort of depressing that, um, there is so little change and so little regard for, um, the contemporary world "
"I came from Japan to the United States in nineteen sixty-one.
It was long long time ago.
That means, I’m pretty old.
I’m not a young girl anymore.
Hehe.
And, uh, ah, in nineteen-sixties, early nineteen-sixties Japan was still, uh, in turmoil of recovering from the damage, they got from Second World War.
And as soon as I came to the United State, I took toefl test, and I enrolled to the University of Illinois mathematics department, as a graduate student.
Well test_ toefl test, I have never taken, uh, multiple choice iteMs  and, uh.
I felt it’s awkward because, uh, it's, uh, requires a lot of different ways to, get answer.
But anyway I barely, uh, passed.
I didn’t flunk out.
And, uh, I went to next_ i, Math department accepted me as a graduate student.
So I started taking, uh, first, uh, courses, uh, English courses.
And it was so elementary courses.
But I enjoyed it because, uh, English education in Japan, at that time, was so bad.
So bad that I couldn’t understand, uh, ah, uh, the radio... Announcers were saying, ""time.""  it said, ""six o’clock in the morning.""  and I couldn’t catch it.
And, I tried to fix my watch, and I listened to, listened to very carefully.
But I couldn’t catch, the correct time.
And finally I figured out, ""okay, let’s go to walk in Urbana, a city, and find out_ uh, clock somewhere, haha and then I can fix my time easily"" hehehe.
Oh that was_ so I started, you know, wandering a small town, Champagne, Urbana.
And looking at restaurant, and whether or not they have a little, you know, clock there.
Hehehe and I found out it was very difficult to find clocks, in the stores.
It is so funny.
I think.
So I finally_ I saw a fat, tall, big man, uh, was wearing a wrist watch.
And so I ask, I ask him ""i’m sorry.
Please help me"".
And he said, ""yes"".
So I pointed to my wrist watch and said, uh, ""what time it is.""  hehehehe.
And there I got fixed my time.
And it was noon.
So I spent, uh, six o’clock in a morning till noon, trying to fix my watch.
Hehehe, and find out the ti- right time.
And that was such a shocking experience to me.
But, it was not only, you know, experience.
And well i_ in Japan I studied mathematics fairly, uh, well in advanced class.
So that, I had very good basic knowledge about it, so that masters, you know, or degree at University of Illinois, in math department, math department was a very easy one for me.
And_ but one day I went to a class.
Guess what, I was almost going to faint because it was, time for little test.
And everybody was ready with the pencil, pencils and waiting for instructors, give us, uh, exams, probleMs  and I did not catch obviously, uh, instructors announcement.
And I was going to faint, and my head started spinning and, my face became, blushed and I lost_ I was almost going to faint.
But, finally I told myself, ""hey I missed English, probably he, he told me it was test today.
And I didn’t catch it.
So I have to do my best, even though I flunk out test.""  and so, I calmed down myself, after, told me myself, ""hey calm down, and, uh, there’s no way to you know, uh, quit.""  so I took test and, uh, I made a B minus.
It was pass.
So it’s ok.
And, the second occasion was_ uh, it was a final exam.
And, I studied well, studied studied, studied.
And, I went to the classroom for taking, the final exam for, test.
That was advanced, uh, analysis, uh, analysis course.
And guess what.
When I started, trying to take  test, everybody has textbooks, notebooks.
Two or three of them, piling up on their desk.
And in order to solve... Answer the problems they kept referring to notebooks, textbooks.
And, here I am, I didn’t have any... Notebook, my notebook, and textbooks, and anything.
And, I get to finish test without any references, or any note- my notebook, or my textbook.
And as soon as I finished, uh, well, you know, exam, I went to my instructor and I said, ""well I did not bring my notebook, or textbooks, while everybody was using them.""  I said ""I was a little bit, uh, stupid.
But, I think it’s not fair.""  so I asked him, ""please let me re-take once more.""  and he said ""well, well, if you pass it then, go for it.
And next semester, you will be better with, uh, uh, English"".
And i, I said to me, ""well, grades are not so important anyway"".
And, uh, I got B plus for that course.
So that uh_ but then I decided why i_ what expression I missed.
And I asked the_ my friend, one of my friends in class.
,He told me it was, I missed ""open book test."" "
"In this lecture, i would like to talk about economic change.
Um, the economic changes that took place in, eighteenth century Britain.
Um, during the eighteenth century, the age of reason, um, new ideas developed, and new ways of thinking developed.
And, these led to two huge economic changes.
The first, uh, t- the agricultural revolution and the second the industrial revolution.
Regarding the agricultural revolution.
Until the eighteenth century the people of each village had shared, uh, the same fields.
And these were usually very large.
At the same time, their animals had run around together on land which belonged jointly, to everyone in the village.
And agricultural methods were not very advanced.
At the beginning of the century, um, some farmers, uh, put fences around their land, and started to experiment, with more scientific ideas about farming.
And of course, they were successful.
They found ways to grow more crops.
. .  And they found ways to raise bigger, and better animals.
[Throat clear] the results of this were  great of course.
And, uh, many landowners put fences around their land.
With the result that many ordinary farmers lost their land, a-and had to move out of the villages.
Um, at the same time.
. .  Uh, of course agricultural production increased greatly.
Um, but less workers were needed to to work, ah, on these large farMs  and food became much cheaper.
But many people in the country, found that they had no work.
And by the middle of the, eighteenth century, there were not enough jobs for the people living in the countryside.
And that caused a-a great deal of suffering and and a great deal of hardship.
But it also made possible, the second great economic change, of the eighteenth century.
Um, this was course the industrial revolution.
Um, this was possible because of the large number of people unemployed, due to the agricultural revolution.
And the industrial revolution provided work for many of those, who had lost their farms jobs, uh, in the countryside.
The industrial revolution started in England, uh, during the middle of the eighteenth century.
Um, from where it spread to the rest of Europe, the U-S, the U-S-A and, and the rest of the world.
Before the industrial revolution, most industrial production had been carried on in peoples' homes.
Um, the first important change, was the inventions of machines, which could be used in the home.
Uh, such as spinning wheels and looms for weaving cloth.
Um, but later even better machines were invented.
Uh, and these were too big to be used i-in a small house.
And most of the new, bigger machines needed a-a source of power, to, to run them.
They needed waterpower.
Uh.
So the- they had to be by a suitable running stream so the power of the running water could be used to work the machines.
And so.
. .  People started to work together in groups, i- in special buildings, which housed their machines.
And these groups were called factories.
And this was the start of the factory system.
People no longer worked at home, but worked in factories.
Of course, people moved, um, their homes nearer to the larger factories.
And new towns started developing and, uh, around the factories, and some of these started getting larger and larger.
Um, during this first period, running water was used for power.
But then in seventeen-sixty-nine the most important invention of the industrial revolution was made.
A man called James Watt, invented the steam engine.
This was soon used as the main source of power for driving all machines.
The steam engine, was very cheap, and very powerful.
And it did not need to be beside a suitable running stream.
And factories could now be in almost any place, which had plenty of water.
During the  eighteenth century, um, the transport system throughout the country was greatly improved.
Uh, in the early eighteenth century roads were often very bad.
And it usually took a whole day to travel fifty miles.
In the middle of the, century a new type of road started being built.
And these new roads were much better.
The idea was very simple.
At first, large stones were laid down.
And these formed the bed.
And then smaller stones were laid on top of those.
And then, on top of the whole thing, even smaller stones were  placed on top.
A-and this type of construction made, uh, for very good roads.
Uh, and transport became much faster.
While the roads were being developed, also canals were being built.
Uh, canals were, uh, much cheaper and much faster than roads.
And so a whole new network of canals was built all over England during this time.
And any visitor to England can go and see them now, to this day.
And then the canals were replaced, by another form of transport, the railways.
In eighteen-fourteen a man called George Stevenson, made the first steam engine, which could move itself.
If you think about it... Steam engines had always, been made to move something else, to, to, to work a machine or move something, uh, move a machine.
What George Stevenson did was make the steam engine move itself.
And this was, uh, the first steam train.
Um, and this led to the development of the railways.
Um, during the nineteenth century, the railway system wa- was developed very rapidly.
Um, and soon railways became very fast and very very cheap.
Uh, the railways changed the lives of so many people.
Before the development of the railways, most people never left their own village.
Or if they did leave, it was only to go to the nearest small town.
After the railways were developed, many people were able to visit other parts of the country.
Even if they were quite poor.
Um, the railways like.
. .  All the, um, developments so the new developments in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, were the direct result of the new scientific way of thinking, which developed at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
These economic changes that took place during the eighteenth century, uh, of course led to many changes in people's lives.
Many industrialists made a lot of money.
And so England, Britain became much richer.
And of course this lead to the middle classes becoming more powerful.
And in eighteen-thirty-two, um, i-i-in Britain, the right to vote for parliament was extended greatly.
And most of the middle class were given the right to vote.
And this of course greatly increased the political power of the middle class.
However, the working class did not get the right to vote for parliament.
And so they had almost no political power.
And the lives of the working classes were often very hard.
Although many goods became much cheaper, due to mass production.
Wages were often very low.
Many people received o- only just enough money to stay alive.
They had to work long hours, o- o- originally as many as fifteen hours a day.
Women and young children also worked in mines and in factories.
And their living conditions were often very bad... With as many as ten people living in one damp and dirty room.
And there was much suffering that came as a result of the industrial revolution.
The suffering was - partly to_ as a result of new economic theories,  that were developed in the middle of the eighteenth century.
Until, uh, this time, until the industrial revolution, the government had tried to regulate and protect trade.
But then in seventeen-seventy-six, um, Adam Smith, um, published a book called &quot;The Wealth of Nations.
&Quot; and he said, that economics would follow natural laws.
And that with free competition the law of supply and demand would ensure that enough goods would be produced at the lowest prices.
And this lead to the idea that the government should not interfere in economic matters.
And this is why_ this is one reason why no laws were passed a-at first to put an end to such terrible things as, women and children being made to work long hours i-in factories.
However though... Th- the situation became so bad that eventually laws were passed.
And the first law regulating employment was passed in eighteen nineteen and that banned the employment of children under nine, in cotton mills.
Under nine years old.
And reduced the working hours of those between the age of nine and eighteen to, no more than twelve hours a day.
By the middle o-of the nineteenth century things had become much better.
With workers only permitted to work ten hours a day.
But, life was still very hard, and wages were still very low.
And there was always the chance of unemployment, due to, a variety of reasons, economic slump or failure of a business, and that could lead to tremendous hardship.
And could even lead to death by starvation for for many, uh, working people."
"It was the start of the school holidays and i'd gone to Tanzania, to visit my friend Rachel.
And, it was surprising my dad had allowed me to go because he didn't used to allow his children to, leave the country.
In fact, leave the house, let alone the country.
So, I went to visit Rachel and, um, it was hotter than I thought.
Much hotter in Tanzania than it normally is in Kenya.
And Rachel, was not, uh, very used to the heat as well, because, she had grown up in Kenya.
And, uh, it was a- generally hotter than it normally is on any day in any part of the world.
We had to take turns keeping cool in the bathroom.
In the bathtub, because there was no shower.
So, we filled the tub with ho_ with cold water and just sit in there.
And, we decided to go swimming.
Although the closest pool was very, very far away.
So, we decided to go and swim in a river.
Only we didn't tell anyone where we were going.
So, um, we dressed up in light clothes.
And we walked to the river.
We got teased on the way, because people in Tanzania don't dress in shorts and small T-shirts.
But, we were only sixteen at the time.
And, we really wanted to dress in what we liked.
So, we wore those.
And when we got to the river.
There was this path that goes under the bridge.
And, we thought it was a nice cool place to swim.
So we, we had our swimming_ swimsuits on, and we slipped into the water and started swimming.
I wasn't a very good swimmer, but Rachel had been swimming, all her life.
So, as we were swimming I noticed that there was a rock moving towards us.
Um, and, um, every time I looked it was coming closer.
And, it was only when it was about, five feet away, that I realized it wasn't a rock.
And I screamed to Rachel to get out of the river.
But, she hadn't, heard me and she kept swimming away.
And... Suddenly, the rock, opened it's mouth and it just turned out to be a crocodile.
And I screamed at that point, and Rachel heard me.
And we scrambled for the river bank.
We scrambled out of the water.
But it was very slippery because of the mud.
And, we kept sli_ sliding back in.
Um, Rachel_ Rachel managed to get out, and she scrambled to safety.
And she dragged me out just before that crocodile locked on my leg.
And, we ran for our lives.
And that was the last time, i've swum in a river in Africa.
And i'll never do it again."
"I would like to compare <em>Things</em> by Georges Perec and <em>Children of the Century</em> by Christiane Rochefort.
Actually i am going compare them from three different, uh, viewpoints.
First of all concerning the opening signals.
Second of all concerning the, um, the major theme in both books, &quot;persuasive suave advertising&quot;.
And then third of all, concerning the commodification of the characters in the_ these novels.
So first of all concerning the opening signals here.
Uh, in Georges Perec <em>Things</em>, the narrator is very much reminiscent of a narrative that we often see in Flaubert's novels.
For example here in, um, <em>Things</em> we see that the narrator is both at a distance from the characters.
And at the sa_ and also he is, um, he is, um, inside the characters.
He seems to be both.
He moves closer to characters at will and farther away at certain times in the novel as well.
It's sort of, the ironical narrator that will remind us of the narrator in books such as <em>Sentimental Education</em>.
And as far as the temporality that we see here in, in <em>Things</em> it is, uh, very unusual because the opening starts out with the, uh, conditional, in fact the whole opening chapter is in the conditional.
We don't see any other verb tenses there.
And it seems to, um, it s- it seems to suggest a dreamlike atmosphere in fact.
Where really the reader would wonder whether or not th- the things mentioned are actually occurring or not.
And, a- an air of mystery as well.
In comparison however, in Rochefort's book, uh, <em>Children of the Century</em> um, there are some similarities but there are also quite a few differences.
In fact both books do concern nineteen-sixties France.
Which was a time of, when, um, actually there was the baby boom in France and there was also, a baby boom.
And there was post-world-war-two era as well.
And also the advent of, um, a lot of advertising during that time.
So it was also in nineteen-sixties France, but the opening signals in Rochefort's work, though similar were different in many ways.
For example, concerning the narrator there.
The narrator is, is the fir_ is in the first person.
Uh, and that is very different from the case in Perec because that makes it a very much more personalized, re_ account of what happened in, uh, nineteen-sixties France.
And also the temporality is, is quite different because, uh, because everything is in the past tense.
A def_ a definitive verb tense rather than in the conditional.
So everything seems to be s_ not kind of what really happened as, as opposed to, uh, giving a sort of a dreamlike atmosphere as we saw in, uh, the other work.
Second concerning the persuasive suave advertising which is actually the central thre- theme in both works.
In <em>Things</em> by Perec though, um, this, this is a major theme in both works.
In Perec novel it seems to be that, more of the things mentioned, uh, in the advertising, are things which are Anglophone or British.
Because the characters, Jerome and Sylvie in &quot;Things&quot; have, um, an incredible fascination for all things which are British and, American.
However in, uh, Rochefort's novel that is not the case.
Uh, the characters are much more interested in American goods.
And.
Uh, this reflects different, uh, this reflects a difference in taste because, characters in, um, Perec's novel are much more interested in appearances and refinement and, and really elegance.
And belong to a_ the higher class than the ones in Rochefort's work_ are much more interested in just surviving and, being able to, um, make ends meet during this, uh, period of time.
And we als_ we also see here that, um, that the characters actually, in, uh, Rochefort's work seem to have much more of a human side.
For example we see, um, throughout Perec's work a list, a list of advertising everywhere.
Collages that he took from, let's say, Express the magazine which was very popular in France then, and still is, Express.
Uh, and they are pasted throughout the novel.
And characters, um, are obsessed with this advertising language and just spit it out constantly.
However in Rochefort's work people, though they do mention a lot of this advertising language.
Seem to have much more of a human dimension.
And, um, this, is much more of a human dimension.
For example Josyanne the central character in Rochefort's text.
Um, she talks much more of her personal experiences.
And how she was neglected in her family.
The family of her parents we_ her father was working constantly, just to support such a large family of children.
How she was neglected, and, um, the human dimension_ she is much more apparent in Rochefort's text than it is in, uh, the text by Perec.
The third thing is that yes there is a commodification of the characters in both texts.
Apparently there is.
However it seems that, the ends of the two authors are, are different.
For example in Perec's text, yes, actually the main characters Jerome and Sylvie, are very much presented as two people who do not talk much.
Who're, who, um, and there is no sex in this novel.
There is no love.
And, um, pretty much the only things which talk seem to be things that surround these two people.
These_ the things that surround them seem to talk for them in their place.
Because there's no_ seems to be no, human characteristics really, of, uh, in the, in this book.
These characters, uh, seem to be defined by the things that surround them, really.
However the case in <em>Children Heaven</em> by Rochefort is different.
Although the characters are somewhat comodified and are_ for example, um, Josyanne  when she was born, they pretty much, um_ the_ her parents neglect her.
And with the birth of each infant their, um_ the parents buy a new_ buy a new invention with the birth of or_ when they're with their children.
The Josyanne family purchased a refrigerator.
Purchase, um, the birth of another child the Josyanne family purchased a TV.
Each child, represents something materialistic.
And this is very much due to the, uh, uh, government system in France at the time.
The Social Security system.
The baby boom generation.
They_ the Fr- French government wanted to encourage, French families to_ into having more children.
And thus they gave many, many social security benefits to those which_ who did.
And so, uh, children are very much, viewed in a very materialistic ma_ a very materialistic way.
And that is what we can see in Rochefort's novel.
But at the same time, uh, you can also see how the children are very neglected.
And, the_ you can see the very human side.
And behind this all the no_ the ends of the two authors are different.
Despite apparent similarities.
In fact Perec seems to critique this society.
This very capitalistic society.
Where everyone's obsessed with buying the next new invention.
And, um, which then renders the characters somewhat, um, um, less human.
Perec [ seems actually less crit_ non-critical, judgmental because uh, not judgmental because of the distance from the characters he has at certain times.
Whereas Rochefort has_ seems to have harsh critique of this very capitalistic society.
This very capitalistic society which makes humans into almost machines and just, um, the symbols of just having more things.  			"
"Well, now i'd like to tell you about my travel experience that I had last summer, which was the summer of nineteen-ninety-seven.
I decided to went_ to go home to visit my parents and to meet friends and to spend sometime, away from the university.
And, some friends suggested that I should visit Prague which is the capital of Czech Republic.
They said that the city is nice and people are great, and everything should be just wonderful.
As the result, I decided to visit Prague.
And I took my, aeroplane tickets to Kiev, but, I decided to fly back to the United States from Prague.
And I decided to go to Prague from Kiev by train.
And, during that travel, I had a little tiny problem.
That problem was the major flood that hit eastern Europe just that summer.
And as a result of that flood, there was a lot of damage, especially in the eastern Europe, in southern Germany, in part of Czech and Poland.
And as the result of that disaster, my train was not supposed to get to Prague, at six, at six A-M on August fifteen, as I planned.
And the problem was that my plane was supposed to depart for Amsterdam at noon... That same day.
I found out about this little problem when the train was on the Czech border.
And I had to spend there, nine more hours, which meant that I was not supposed to, to catch my plane.
Well at that point I s- I thought that there was only one way to try to get that plane.
I decided to get off the train and to take a taxi.
That was pretty interesting decision.
And I found out about that immediately when taxi driver asked for one hundred fifty dollars, to get me to Prague, before my plane leaves.
And that talk_ that conversation took place at the Czech border at eight-thirty A-M, on August the fifteenth.
Wh-,while my plane was supposed to depart at noon.
Well, we covered the distance of two hundred miles in a little bit more than two hours, because I was lucky, because the speed limit in Czech Republic is a hundred miles per hour.
Well, when I got to the airport, it was a quarter to noon.
And, unfortunately, I received the following message from the people from K-L-M airlines.
They said the check in was closed, because it was too late for the international departure.
I was a little upset.
Well fortunately, they found different flight to get me to New York.
And I ended up flying to New York instead of Minneapolis but that was just the first part of this story.
When i, when I landed in New York and passed, border control, I went to pick up my baggage.
But unfortunately I couldn't find it.
The problem was, that there was so, big rush in Prague, while I was departing that people just didn't know what to do with it.
And they just left it alone in order to not to send it anywhere_ somewhere in the world.
Well I ended up in America while my baggage was still in Europe.
Then I sh- was, supposed to get to catch a connecting flight to Minneapolis by North West Airlines.
Well, when I got to the counter of North West Airlines, I found out that, my flight was canceled, due to bad weather all all over the midwest.
Which meant that I was supposed to spend the night in New York.
And I didn't have any friends or relatives or somebody else who could, give me a shelter.
That's why I spent more than three hours at the counter of North West Airlines trying to get hold of somebody in charge who could take care of this problem.
Well finally I received a compensation for that whole day.
And I received a room at Hotel Marriot in New York.
And, regular price for that room is approximately two hundred dollars.
So that was a pretty good compensation for my probleMs  well next day I got safely home.
And the only problem that i_ then the only_ and, the last problem that I had a- after that trip, was that my baggage arrived to Duluth, Minnesota five days later."
"One day, I think, I was over my friend's house, in west New York, which is, about twenty-five miles away from my house.
And, uh, that, that evening it started storming.
Like hail and snow and rain.
And, um, we were hanging out [passing the time] and I figured, ""i think it's time for me to go.""  I wan- you know, I didn't wanna catch the heavier stuff, during the, during the later evening.
So, um, I think it was about one o'clock in the morning, and I said, ""okay I'm gonna leave.""  so I got in the car and I started going, down the street.
And all of a sudden I saw my car started heating up.
So I stopped, and I turned around,and went back to the house, and said, uh, ""i think I should let the car cool down for a while."" so... We watched TV for like a couple hours.
And I think around five o'clock in morning, I said, ""listen, I really wanna go home.""  now why it was at five o'clock in the morning, I don't know but I got in the car, and after chipping all the ice off the windshield, and and the the windows and everything, I got in, warmed it up, and I started driving.
And, then I realized that my left windshield wiper wasn't,going anywhere, cuz it started, it started raining so it was melting off the ice.
And I pulled over, and I just thought, ""i don't know what to do.""  I didn't wanna stay here, I wanted to get home.
I just had this urgent feeling to get home.
So... I said, ""okay Ebony, you can do this.
Just drive slowly and, you know, be careful.""  so I sat there and prayed for a little bit.
And I asked God to make sure I got home safely, and I said okay [breathes shallowly]so I'm, I'm, I'm getting on, uh, Route 3 it's called, and, um, I'm driving, and I'm,  I'm going maybe about, forty, forty-five miles an hour, in the slow lane of course.
And, um, I put my hazard lights on.
And, I'm, I'm_ right now I can, I can see out the out the win_ out the, out the window cuz, the rain is melting the ice.
So I'm pretty good.
But then it starts hailing, so I'm like, ""oh my God.""  then my, my windshield starts freezing up.
So I turn my, my right_ my windshield wipers on.
And, I'm leaning to my right, to, to see, to see a little more.
Anyway I get on_ I get further on, on Route 3.
And all of a sudden, I really can't see anything.
I get_ the hail starts, it starts getting harder and harder.
I am like, ""oh my God.""  my stomach starts to hurt, I start getting a headache.
I roll down my window to, you know, to see if I can just poke my head out, but I couldn't do that either, cuz it was so cold.
And I pulled over, I started scraping off the ice again, and, um, I was hoping that someone would pull over and just say, ""well, I have some, you know, some salt or some ice I can put on your windshield, or something, I don't know, so they help me fix it maybe.
But, uh, no one pulled over.
And I sat on the side of the road for about five minutes, until I said, ""no I wanna get home.""  I really do.
So, um, I got in the car, and I said_ I prayed one more time.
And my stomach was still hurting and, um, i, ii I think I rode on the shoulder.
For, for as long as I could.
With my hazard lights on.
And, um, I rolled up, I rolled up the window because, I thought that the air was coming in, that it'd be, it'd be fogging up the inside too or something.
I don't know why I thought to, roll it up but I did.
And it started to work.
It started to rain again and, um, my right windshield wip_ windshield wiper was on, and it was going enough that I could see.
And then, like, out of the blue I sa_ you know, there was like a hole_ there was like a clear piece of, window that I could see out of.
Um, at the bottom of my left side.
, So I just started looking, I started_ I bent down like an old woman, sort of, and started driving like that.
You know, hand on the three and nine, type thing.
And I'm just going like about fifty miles an hour.
And I'm staying in the right lane.
And then it starts raining hard, and it starts melting off the ice more.
So I can see, almost clearly.
And so my, my right windshield wiper is on sp_ fast speed.
And i, I lean to my right, and I just started driving.
I'm in a middle lane, kinda swerving cuz I can't see the lines, cuz it's covered by like, the, the ice and the slush, and everything.
And, um, I'm, I'm not scared any more and I'm driving, with this lane.
Like I'm cool, but I'm not hahaha.
And, um, I get to my turn off finally.
After passing about two accidents, ""God,"" and I didn't even think about it, I just kept going.
You know, I just kept thinking,""stay in the middle lane, cuz you don't want to be in the right you want to be in the left.""  and, um, I thought to stop at a gas station for help.
But I said, ""no.
I really want to get home.""  why.
Hahha I don't know.
But, I finally got home.
And, uh, stopped and took a deep breath.
And thanked God and, and park the car.
It was about six-thirty in the morning at that time.
I went in the house and I was just exhausted.
So, uh, that was an ordeal that I went through.
Hehe hehehe."
"I have a new job.
I just got it today.
And it means i’m going to have to change my schedule.
Right now i’ve just finished my exams for university.
And so_ before i used to wake up, and study and take breaks and then try and study and end up doing something else, all day.
But now i have to wake up at 7 o'clock in the morning and cycle to Kirtlington, in North Oxford from my home in South Oxford.
To go and work at this job.
And what i have to do, i have to, i have to enter data, into the computing system there.
It’s called data entry.
And it’s not very exciting.
But it pays well enough for me to have_ be able to afford to go to Indonesia, in July.
And when i go to Indonesia with my friend Robin, we are going to go and monitor the elections in East Timor.
So i'm gonna have an entirely new schedule then."
"A simple history of West Africa.
Nowadays, the, the economic_ the vibrant countries, of West Africa, are the, are the Coastal Nations.
Ghana, perhaps is, is coming on.
Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria.
They are the, the players in the region, which, are the strongest.
But that has not always been the case.
And in fact, the whole access of economic wealth, was orientated towards the Saharan fringes.
Some three to four hundred years ago.
Control of the lucrative trans-Saharan trade was, was where power was.
The savannah kingdoms, was where the wealth was.
And, it's only through the, the colonial, um, and the traders, who, who came into the region, and altered the ch_ altered the access, of, um, of con_ of power in the region.
Looking back, at that period, you can still see imprints of it, in, British society today.
The Guinea coin, refers to the fact that the, the gold, came from the Guinea region of West Africa.
But, it didn't come via th_ via the, the, the co- coastal route.
It crossed the Sahara.
Um, and went up to the, the trading place of Tripoli, and, um, Dakara.
And their great trains, camel trains, which went across the desert, and the oasises where they drunk, and watered, and got supplies.
That_ and there were great kingdoms which controlled, these, these trading points.
And then, when, they dropped further south into the, the gulf hills in Ghana, or the diamond mines in Sierra Leone.
Or, to get_ um, the s- slaves were an important resource which was_ were traded at that time.
But the focus was northwards, across the Sahara, towards the, um, towards the, the Orient.
There were Colonial, um, expansion in trading.
Particularly, the Portuguese started it in about the sixteen hundreds.
Setting up slowly, slowly, um, trading points, along the, the coast.
Um, and the British, and the Dutch, and the French.
Slowly the access changed, and particularly the west, west Atlantic slave trade.
That was a great focus for_ of changing the, the access.
But then, the, the starting of plantations, the f_ the exploitation of the s_ the southern forest resources in the, in the tropical forests.
Um, the plant_ cocoa plantations, oil_ everything has changed the, the access of, um, of West Africa.
And, that's the short history, of West Africa.
Ha ha."
"I have a really interesting story that i would like to tell you.
My boyfriend and i were supposed to get together for spring break.
He was supposed to go to the university where i was studying to visit me.
But he couldn't get a visa, so he couldn't, um, leave his country.
He's from Ecuador, and i was studying in the United States.
So he called me on Thursday night, to tell me that he couldn't come.
And i was very upset.
We were both very upset because we had been planning, all along he would come.
I had been studying really hard and trying to get a lot of work done so that i would have a lot of time to spend with him, when he got here.
Well as it turns out  he couldn't come.
But, the following week starting Monday after the Thursday he had called, was our spring break, so, in my head i started planning right away after we stopped, calling that i could maybe surprise him.
So i_ since i'd already got a lot of work done, this wasn't going to be too bad, but i still had a paper to write.
So i spent all Friday night writing the paper.
I got it done about  Saturday and i had to be in New York to leave, to fly to Ecuador at about eight o'clock.
So i really hurried up, ran and printed out the paper that i had to turn in, and packed up my bags and, got to Newark_ to New York.
And then_ so all the way in the plane i'm thinking how am i gonna surprise him.
What's the best way to do it.
How would it be nicest.
And i met some really nice people on  the plane, and so we were talking about this.
And i just kept getting more and more excited.
So by the time i got to Ecuador i was really really excited.
I got there probably at about six or seven in the morning, which was the good time.
So i got on a little trolley, I got on the bus and i made it to the city where my, boyfriend lived.
And, then i was still trying to decide how i was going to do it.
And so, i got in a taxi and i had to try to find my way to this place.
Well, first i had told him, that the, um, the place_ at first i told him that i needed to go to a little store that was on <i>Guaquille</i> Street.
So we drove up and down <i>Guaquille</i> Street and we didn't see the little store.
So then i was thinking that maybe i had the name wrong, because it had been a while since i was there.
And so i was like &quot;well, i don't think it's this name, but_&quot; and i was trying to tell him more less where it was at.
Because i had remembered, remembered going by it before.
And so then finally it turns out that it was on <i>Galapagos</i> Street.
And so we made it to the store.
And he dropped me off, and i got out.
And since i got there on Sunday, the store was closed.
So i went to a little grocery store, that was right beside the package place.
And, i had one of the people from the grocery store call, my boyfriend to tell him that he had a package to pick up, and, to ask him if he could get here as soon as possible because she had to go away to go on a trip.
So i was inside the little grocery store, which is right by the package agency.
And i was all nervous and getting excited that he was going to be coming.
And everyone_ the other people who were in the grocery store were also getting kind of, excited because they saw that i was so excited.
And so finally my, boyfriend drove up.
And they told me_ the little store had the grocery store in front and the little house in the back.
So they told me to go into the little house so that my boyfriend wouldn't see me.
And so my boyfriend got out of the car and he saw that the package agency was closed.
And so one of the, um, ladies from the store went over to the package agency and told him that, since the lady had to leave early, she had left the package inside their house.
And so, sh- she kept trying to get him to go inside the store and then to go inside their house.
But he was getting kind of nervous because everyone was laughing at him.
So he didn't really want to go out, or go inside the store.
So then, i finally saw him and i walked out and i'm like &quot;hi.
&Quot; and, i was so happy and, excited to see him and i think he was also happy and excited.
But he was just kind of speechless.
He didn't really say anything, but it was just really really nice to see him and, it made for a very very nice week.
A lot better than, the week would have been had i had just stayed at school all by myself. "
"When i got out of college, my boyfriend and i decided to go traveling.
So... We sold a motorcycle that we had and we took that money, and we bought an old... Truck like a...Blazer sort of thing.
Except, they didn't have blazers back then.
And we, um, set out.
We started in New Jersey.
We went west, all the way to Montana.
And every night we camped out.
We didn't stay in campgrounds or motels, just wherever we could find, we'd pull off at the side of the road.
Sometimes we slept in the truck and sometimes we put up a tent.
At least until we got to Montana.
It's more wild out there, so it was easier to find places to camp.
Then, in Montana we started going north, up through British Columbia, the Yukon territory, the north west territories, of Canada.
And those were some of the most beautiful places.
There's a place in British Columbia we stayed, just for about a week.
And it was wonderful.
We just fished out of a stream every evening, had a trout for breakfast.
It was really wonderful.
And these were not campgrounds with hook ups, it was the real wilderness.
Except i was afraid of bears all the time.
But other than that, it was nice.
So we started going up, further and further north, until we got to, uh, a river in the north west territories near the Arctic Circle.
We were gonna go across on the ferry but the river was still frozen.
It was June and the river was still frozen.
So we had to camp for a few days, in this, uh, just where we were.
It turned out to be a little Indian village.
There was people living_ old people .
Um, i don't know what tribe or whatever they were, but they were the native people there.
The young people lived across the river in the town.
The old people were afraid to go into town because the young people, would beat them up and rob them.
It was, pretty bad.
There was a lot of alcoholism.
Uh, but for the old people they... Told us that...Because of, uh, modern innovations that, disrupted the caribou migration, their traditional way of life was disturbed.
So they had to live off of government handouts.
Which is pretty sad.
So we spent a few days with those people, and then we crossed the river.
And we kept going north.
We went all the way up through the Arctic Circle.
Which was_ it was so beautiful up there because it was so, spacious and you could see miles and miles of tundra, with little flowers growing.
It was just such a, a wilderness feeling.
And we met young people in parks, and they told us the good thing about the tundra you can cut a hole and keep a, can of beer cold there in the, uh, permafrost.
So we went all the way up to the Arctic Circle, then we came back down again and we drove into Alaska.
And, this was in nineteen eighty one, i think it might be a lot different now.
But we met a lot of interesting people, but they weren't very friendly because, they went out there to be alone and, to live an individualistic life and they didn't want people coming.
So we drove all the way out to Homer, Alaska, which is on, the coast.
And we went to work in the canneries there, which a lot of young people do.
We just set up our tent on the beach, and lived in that for a couple of months.
We worked in the, canneries for about twelve hours a day.
Worked the night shift.
I can't, remember now how i did this because, i didn't have, bathrooms or showers.
I mean i was living in a tent on the beach, and i can't even remember how i took care of those things.
But i remember... The glaciers and the ocean and the, ice fields.
And how they turned different colors at different times of the day.
And i remember there were some Russian women who worked in the cannery too, and they used to take home the fish heads to make soup out of.
So we stayed in Alaska for a few months.
Then we sold the truck, and we started hitchhiking home.
Down the coast of Alaska, down into Seattle and California.
And i remember when we got to California we went into a supermarket and i was amazed, to see so many fruits and vegetables.
Because in alaska there isn't a lot of that.
And it just looked like, the most_ like a garden of paradise.
So many fruits and vegetables, it was just beautiful there.
So we got picked up by truckers sometimes, and sometimes they were a  little bit...Rough hehe.
We got picked up, by crazy people fairly often.
But at least it was a ride.
When we got into Arizona, and New Mexico it was better because_ um, more indians there, native Americans, and they always pick you up.
So whenever we saw one their truck coming down the street we knew we get a ride.
Then when we got to Colorado i called home and, found out my father was, in the hospital and i had to get home right away.
So... Someone picked us up hitchhiking and he kindly drove me to the, bus station cuz he knew i needed to get home.
So i took a bus home from there, and got back into Philadelphia, back into New Jersey.
And it was, it was real different being there, after being in such wilderness areas.
It took me a... A while to get used to... Not having to be, uh, cautious all the time, and to have everything be safe.
But after a while i got_ well i guess i didn't get used to it.
Haha... But i was home."
"I've been away from home for about two years.
And, i was quite eager, to, return to my home country.
Um, so i decided to, to go home.
But, the way to go home was, a problem.
I didn't want to just, um, fly back from where i was, which was in Hong Kong.
Um, because i, i, i couldn't probably handle just being plucked from one culture to, um, a very different one.
And having to settle down immediately.
I always had the, the idea of going overland.
Crossing from Hong Kong, all the way overland to England, which you can do if you... Class the Channel Tunnel, as going overland.
Um, so what i did, um, i went on the Trans-Siberian Railway.
And, um, i got on_ i went up through the East Coast of China up to Beijing.
And, um, then i bought a ticket to Ulaanbaatar, which is in Mongolia.
Uh, i_ lots of ma_ most people just, take a direct transit, route through to Moscow, which is a seven day train trip.
And, um_ but i didn't want to do this.
I wanted to stop off in Mongolia, rather than see it through a window.
Um, so i just, bought my ticket to, the capital of Mongolia.
And from then, was hoping to buy the rest of the ticket all the way to Moscow.
Mongolia, having been in China for, almost two years.
Or in wi_ mixing with Chinese people.
Was, a culture shock.
A big culture shock.
Um, first of all, there were, about a few things i noticed.
First of all was_ there was no pollution.
It was, clear, crisp, skies.
Um, i'd been in Beijing previously and there was nineteen million people, in Beijing.
In Mongolia, which is the size of Switzerland, France, Italy, Austria, and, um, It- um, Germany, um, there's only two million people.
So you can imagine, that.
Ha.
And the third one was, i'd been used to inhi- inhibited curiosity.
Where the Chinese just sort of stare at you, for long periods of time.
And, the Mongolians didn't do that.
They must've, they must've been used to sort of_ the Russian, um, that you know, they're white as well.
So, it was_ and the_ and it was very interesting i think.
But, um, it was_ first of all it was the colors that_ i, i, just loved it.
It was amazing.
And, um... And the, the, the remoteness of Mongolia.
It was, this vast empty spaces of... Desolate nothing.
And then you might just see a Nomad on a horse wondering with his lasso pole.
Um, but it was beautiful, and, a sort of_ a lot of beauty.
I mean some people might find it, rather boring.
But, i found it... Jus- just rather, um, uh, kind of good to experience that.
And, because i'd come from a very materialistic, place, of Hong Kong, and, it was, uh, i liked the contrast of two different places like that."
"Um, last year for, um, four months i went and lived in the Czech Republic.
Um, my girlfriend is Czech.
So it, um, turned out i wasn’t expecting much work for the autumn.
So i thought we, we could go and live there.
And, um, she, she, um, has taught English in the past so she got a job there teaching English.
Did a, a, little teaching English myself.
But, um, i was lucky to be in the situation, i had a little savings put by so, um, what with the rate of exchange being so favourable, um,  i, i could actually go and, live what would be almost nothing here.
You know on a, a,  meagre sort of savings i could live there for four months, quite nicely.
So it gave me, an opportunity to do a lot of things.
Um, and i, i like the Czech Republic an awful lot.
Um, i, i sort of, i fou_ found it fascinating, in that it is a, a country which has changed so much lately.
Um, that, um, you have gone from having, you know, a sort of massive, sort of state socialist society, to, to having a, a country that had_ try and be sort of, standard neoliberal European country.
And, um, certain parts of it were very depressing.
The, the extent to which certain people have_ it, it is like Britain in the eighties concentrated immensely, in that certain people have made, so much money at the expense of, of the, the sort of state generally.
Um, the_ in assets being sold off and, um, it, it seems such a shame to think of all the, the, the labour and work of, of people over , you know, forty years in building up state industries being sold off, um, so cheaply and under such dubious circumstances.
Um, i don’t know how the, the country is going to, turn out, and change in the next few years.
I think a lot of people are, finding it very hard.
Um, the change of mentality, and that th_ things aren’t as easy as they could be.
It certainly, um, i mean it, it is nowhere near like, um, Russia is.
But, um, it’ll certainly probably be within the EC within the next ten years.
Um, so, i, i don’t know.
I'm uh, i'm sort of fa_ fascinated how it will turn out.
If they will manage to, to sort of preserve the best of, um, perhaps, their ways of thinking and, and, um, the_ you will see something that is new rather than just a repetition of, uh, you know, Britain or, um, other western European countries.
Um... I feel, it does feel sort of, unfair being somebody from, Britain going over there.
In the sense that, um, i, you know, can turn what is, considered, uh, uh, um, a miserable amount of, um, earning here into what a normal person would earn over there.
And that, um, you know, you, you'd take up an idea that, oh well, you know, this taxi driver, he is over charging me so dreadfully.
But, you know, that he is doing you a disservice by charging you, lets say, you know, two pounds instead of what would be fifty-p there.
But then you think the extent to which, uh, a lot of the_ there's a lot of it.
A lot of it happens.
A lot of, young people i know in their twenties go travelling around the world, and, um, i don’t know, i_ it, it seems, it seems, uh, so, um, i don’t know.
Such a disadvantage that people there we_ are never able to, to, do the opposite.
That if a Czech person, um, comes to Britain that they have to, in a weeks holiday they can spend what took them, you know, a month, two months at home to, to earn in a, in a, you know, hard working job."
"In, i think it was_ yeah, in June 1997 i, traveled in Tibet.
Um, i took_ i came over land from, China.
And, um... It was, it was a very interesting experience.
Um, it was... First_ i mean, first of all you feel quite_ when yo- you come in to the, capital city of Lhasa.
It's elevated at about 3,600, meters high.
And... For the first few days you're told not to, sort of, do much.
Not do too much sort of exercise or anything.
And i did feel quite dizzy and_ but af_ after a while, y- you do acclimatize.
Um, i, traveled there on my own.
And, in order to, to... Um, get about the country you have to_ the best way is to, sort of, advertise in some hotels and... To sort of share the costs of jeeps and, camping equipment or whatever like that.
So, um, i did that and i went off on, endless sort of treks a- around Tibet.
And... Um, had lots of sort of confrontations with, P-S-B which is the Public Security Bureau, and it's the Chinese Police.
Which are everywhere, unfortunately.
Um, and that's_ it's quite noticeable.
There's a lot of tension in Lhasa especially.
Um, and, um, what a shame.
But, what's amazing is that the, um, Tibetans are still, so religiously devout.
Um, yet, you know, through all the Chinese occupation and, um, infiltration of Chinese, from different parts of China, to eradicate, this way of life.
Um, they're still_ i mean, i don't think they ever completely will.
But, um, it's, it's a very interesting sort of, non_ problem really.
I mean do you keep the Chinese there.
Um, or do you, you know i think that_ i think the Tibe_ i think the Chinese are glad to be in Tibet.
And to sort of kill them_ kill each other.
You know, i don't, i don't think, um_ i think in a way it's good to have the Chinese there.
But, uh, then it's bad, on, um_ other side to sort of, um, what they're doing, you know, the religion and stuff like that.
Um, but saying that it was, it was the_ one of the best places i've traveled to.
And, um, it was such a beautiful, beautiful place.
High mountains, and p- purple light.
And, i think, um,  would love to go back to Tibet and, um, experience the sort of, going back in time.
A medieval feel.
Um, i'm sure it will still, still be like that in years to come.
But, um, in Lhasa itself, it's, it's changing quite quickly.
And you can buy chocolate bars there now.
Um, but it's still a remarkable place to visit.
And, uh, to see this ancient way of life."
"England has always traditionally been the home of some of the finest theatre in the world.
If not the finest theatre in the world.
So it's with, um, horror that i heard recently that, um, it's being considered that actors might be_ going to be wired up with mics, at the, um, Royal Shakespeare Company.
Um, i think it was the Royal Shakespeare Company.
It was either the Royal Shakespeare Company or the National Theatre.
Um, both of which are supposed to be the sort of two leading Shakespearean theatres in this country.
So, um, i think that is rather a, a sorry state that our theatre, um, productions have come to.
And is indicative of the fact that our actors are not trained properly nowadays.
They always used to be.
Um, i was trained as an actor.
I went to drama school.
And before i went to drama school i.
Had lots of voice classes.
And in fact, um, i myself do teach, um, voice production to young people.
Not actually to professional actors.
But to people who are interested in, going into acting.
And i am also an actor myself.
Um, so I really do think this is a, very sorry state of affairs.
And I think it's partly too, because now people tend to go into television.
They do these soaps.
They're not really actors.
They're just, being themselves.
'Cause people in Eastenders, Brookside, whatever.
If you talk to them off the screen, you find they sound, exactly the same.
Um, and then if you were to put_ when you put them on stage, you can't hear them cause they're just used to talking at, um, their own levels.
And in their own accents.
They, hehe, they can't take on any other kind character or identity, uh, very easily, on the whole.
I mean I know i’m, perhaps being a bit_ um, generalising a bit.
But it, it does happen a lot now.
And, um, and when you go to the theatre you can't hear them.
Whereas in the old days you would've taught_ to breathe, and breathing and to project your voice so that you could be heard right at the back of the Gods.
Which is the term we use for the, upper gallery and the back of the gallery.
And, um, hence the expression too, playing to the gallery, which we used to have.
Um, and as i say unfortunately nowadays, um, even th- those of them wh- who have been to some sort of drama school.
Uh, except for a very few of the top ones, voice production is sorely neglected.
And so, this is wh- what is now happening that they make their names on television.
And because theatre is in such a bad way they want the big names th- that people will recognise from, from the soaps and the programs that they have seen them in.
So they put them in to, um, full scale theatre productions.
And of course they can't be heard.
So therefore we've got to this sorry state now where we're talking about mic-ing actors on the stage.
Which i think is absolutely appalling and will be the death of British theatre.
It's very sad i think if this does happen.
And i really_ i think_ i hope that some of the leading established actors in this country will, um, form, a protest, and i will be one of the first to be out there marching to protest against this outrage.
Hehe."
"In Britain we have many interesting things.
And we have started off many, trends and whatever.
And one of them_ i guess the strangest things we have here, is that we have someone_ a character called 'The Wickedest Man in the World'.
So we have the strange, um, honour, in this country of giving birth or, nurturing the wickedest man in the world.
Which is someone called Aleister Crowley.
Course this, this phrase, 'The Wickedest Man in the World', was_ is not really true.
It is something that was kind of, coined or, put together by the, the press.
The popular press in the nineteen-thirties when this guy li_ i should say that Aleister Crowley, he is not actually alive anymore though he's such a legendary, personality that a lot of people think that he is still alive.
You know, he's kind of, he's, he's really part of a lot peoples', kind of nightmare haha world in some ways.
But he actually_ he died in, i think, in about nineteen forty-seven.
But in the nineteen thirties he, he tried to start a little kind of, commune i s'pose.
Before anything like that had been done.
It was one of the first, alternative communities that he tried to start in, Sicily.
And, the press then were always into having an idea of a good story just, just as they are_ i don't know what newspapers where you come from.
But here we have these kind of tabloid presses that_ they don't have a lot of news in them.
They just_ they kind of have stories about crazy goings on, or, you know, someone have an affair with a vicar or whatever.
So, it's not, not serious stuff.
So that- that sort of press has always been the_ here.
And they've looked for, characters.
And they actually sent the journalist to spy on this community, i s'pose.
And try and say what things that they could do that they could then report to their readers who had co_ you know, and it was mainly things like, nude bathing on the beach, you know.
Which of course in the nineteen thirties is, maybe, a naughty thing to do, you know and_ of course, you can put this in, in the press.
And they built up this kind of, image really.
And some crazy things did go on in the community.
Uh, i mean, it was probably a little bit out of control.
It was probably a bit ahead of its time.
And they certainly didn't have any money, right.
For things like facilities and sanitation.
So, uh, i think someone did actually die there of some local disease that they'd, they'd caught.
And, of course, when the press took that idea, they turned that into all sorts of fantasy things about crazy things going on there.
And about black magic, and, um, curses, and, and whatever.
And they, came up with the idea of Aleister Crowley, the wickedest man in the world.
Haha, and it, it really stuck.
Obviously... I think probably Aleister Crowley was, was a lot more of a serious character than people think.
I'm quite interested in paganism, and i think even people who don't like him as an individual, will acknowledge that he got things going.
He broke the ice if, if it_ as, as it were.
Things are easier now.
People are more in the open, and more sensible.
But someone had to start it.
And whoever was going to say_ do something unusual and break away from the tradition, is bound to get a lot of the press on the_ their back, and is bo- bound to kind of suffer for it.
So, i think most people don't like him as an individual.
But, admire him as a person who, who did do something.
Who did sort of_ he was a very erudite man, a very clever man.
And i_ uh, a very sort of adventurous_ and he wrote lots of amazing books, on magic and paganism and folklore and history and, uh, ancient times and stuff.
And those books are_ you know, have changed the world really.
Certainly now people have expanded on them.
So, like him or hate him, he ch_ for people now he changed the world.
He had an affect.
He lived his life and things, things would be, you know, a lot different otherwise.
So, Aleister Crowley, 'Wickedest Man in the World', i think, not really.
I mean_ but an interesting guy maybe a, a difficult guy.
And, i'm glad people like that exist in this country.
And i_ in some sort of way i'm kind of proud that, we gave 'The Wickedest Man in the World', to the world."
" uh, it was about two years ago, and um... It was Lunar New Year.
And um i was in Vietnam, with uh, my friends and since new year in general is a good occasion to just, go out and, have fun and, see friends and, go and meet people.
So we decided that, okay now that have some, time off from school, let me do something, like an adventure.
And we thought about it, we wanted to go somewhere far, to, do some hiking and, just, you know, like get out of Hanoi.
And then, somebody had an idea of going to China.
And everyone at first was scared of going there, because... It's a long way and we do not know anyone there.
We do not know the language.
And it requires a lot of papers to simply cross the borders.
But then we all decided that, okay we had nothing to loose.
We had the time, and we had, know, some pocket money.
And we said okay.
So it was the second day of the new year.
In Vietnam, we have, um, a very long break for new year.
Like fourteen days or something.
So the second day of the new year, we left Hanoi, at around six o'clock to catch a night train to the_ the border town in Vietnam called (Glaxon).
And it was very interesting.
And, um, since it was new years, not many people traveled.
So, the train was kind of deserted.
And um we had all the compartment to ourselves.
It was a night train and, it was very cold.
And we arrived at the border town about seven o'clock next morning.
And from then on, we would have to look for a way to, cross the border.
And it was very difficult to cross the border without the necessary, permission and paper works.
And um, somehow we ran into this, local who was very good at guiding people, like through the border without any permission at all.
So he said &quot;okay you guys are gonna go with us.
&Quot; and we said &quot;okay.
&Quot; and we figured out this much and this much that we had to give him.
And, we, started to hit the road.
Um, and the story was, very funny, uh in the sense that um that part of the border used to be a uh, mine field.
And even though a lot of mines were, um, deactivated after the war, the border war in_ between Vietnam and China in seventy-nine.
It was still, very dangerous to just walk across it.
And um, you know, we wouldn't have been able to do it without, the local man who was showing us.
So, seven of us, six boys and one girl_ and we started crossing the border onto China.
It took us about, two hours to cross about one thousand meters, which is about um a thousand yards.
And, it was um very intense.
We_ all of us were like hanging onto suspense, and... We were worried about going back.
How we would make it back.
But then we were on the other side of the border.
And we, caught a bus and all of us got on.
And we pretended to be Chinese... And even though we didn't say anything in Chinese at all.
So it was very funny.
And we went into this border town on the Chinese side, and we saw things that we had never seen before.
Like um.
A lot of vegetables that looked huge, like s- very different from those we have back in Vietnam.
And the people and the places and the architecture, it was nothing like we had seen before.
So we all_ we all felt kind of ah strange.
And we had some food and uh we ate some fish and, chicken.
And then uh we spent about a day there.
And it was_ we bought a lot of stuff because everything, um, was very cheap.
So um, by about 5 o'clock that the afternoon we came back to the border, and that local guy was there waiting for us.
So he took us back on the same route that we came over on.
And when we were_ when we were in Vietnam we just felt so much safer, and so much better.
And the funny thing is, um, Vietnam and China has different time zone.
It was one hour different.
And um... I had never experienced that feeling before, stepping over an imaginary line, and you are an hour ahead.
Now_ which i think, you know_ in the modern days, it's, um, more widely experienced with um, flying from one country to another, but not walking like i did. "
"Recently i was reading a book about Australian aborigine culture.
And i've become very interested in the culture of the aborigines in Australia.
I think it's very interesting, and very inspiring even and makes_ it moves me more than, uh, simply being intellectually or mentally... Curious to me, or just sort of fascinating like looking at some statistics or some data.
It's actually very moving because, it seems to be something which i identify with, or something which i understand, or something which i'd even like to make a part of my own life.
So in this book it told a story of something which happened recently, in Australia.
Europeans first came to Australia about two hundred years ago.
A little bit more now than two hundred years.
And, um, since then, they've done many things, and more or less what the Europeans did when they came to Australia, was change the, culture which was there, changed the culture of the aborigines, so that was more like the European culture.
And, um, there's a lot of misunderstanding which has happened between the, aborigines and the Europeans.
And there's been a lot of pain.
And so the Europeans, misunderstand the aborigines and the aborigines misunderstand the Europeans.
And now, over two hundred years later... People on uh_ people who are aborigines, or people who are Europeans, or people who think of themselves that way, are angry at the people who they think are different.
And this is a story which describes that situation.
So... On the two hundredth anniversary of when the first Englishmen came to Australia, there was going to be a large cerebration.
And the Australians who were from Europe, said &quot;let's celebrate this because this is where we come from, this is our ancestor and this is how we got here and, so let's, let's cerebrate this, and let's have a party.
&Quot; so they built a big wooden ship, a big uuum ship that they_ this Englishman sailed, this Captain Cook sailed, and they made a big wooden ship like the one he sailed.
And they were going to have it come into the harbor where he originally came, and they were going to have fireworks and a big celebration.
And the story is that some aborigines or some people who had an aborigine background, maybe they were mixed European ab- and aborigine, they were standing on some, uh, cliffs looking out onto the bay and seeing this big ship came_ come in.
One of the younger Aborigines, who was maybe a teenager in his twenties, he said &quot;you know, we aborigines we are strong and we are very, uh, adapted to nature, so i think, you know, we can just swim out in that bay, no one would notice us, and we could, just put some like dynamite_ and what if we just blow a hole in that ship, and we'd end that wh- whole party that these people are having.
&Quot; because he was very angry.
He was angry because he was... Feeling pain from when the Europeans came and and they did many things which hurt many aborigines.
They killed many aborigines or made the aberdi- aborigines live the European way of living.
So he was feeling a lot of anger.
And so he said this to one of the older aborigines.
And the reply from the older aborigines was &quot;yes, it's true , we have, um, many um, good swimmers, and we are very strong in our bodies and and we are very good in nature.
But, um, let's not, um, blow a hole in the ship.
I don't think that's a good idea.
&Quot; and then the younger person he said &quot;oh, you know what, your attitude is the exact attitude of why the Europeans came, and were able to do so many things that have caused so much pain and make me so angry because you didn't fight back, and you didn't stand up for yourself.
So it's your attitude which needs to change and we need to fight back.
&Quot; and then the older aborigine said &quot;if i fought back, if if i, was violent about something which i didn't like or which i saw was being done to my people,&quot; he said &quot;then i wouldn't be an aborigine.
&Quot;and so i thought that was very moving.
That that, um, this book had this story in it.
And i really thought about that.
And i tried to think about what this means that, even if there's violence done to you, or something has made you very angry, that if you, respond or act in a way which is also angry or violent, that then...  You don't stand for anything except for the violence"
"There are about three different routes of the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
Um, the i took, took_ went_ started in Beijing.
And, um, ended up in Moscow, going through Mongolia.
Um, the first day is traveling through China.
And you, go along_ you see part of the Great Wall.
Um, um, before it sort of... Snakes away into the distance.
And then you_ about_ you go through a very, deserty part of China.
Um, where they massive problems with drought and everything.
But then, the last, checkpost is Erlian border, before you enter Mongolia.
And, um... At this point in the journey you've had like passport control, and immigration_ everything like that.
Um, and, checking for contrabands, in the carriages.
It's, it's quite exciting.
This all happens about_ around midnight.
And then they change the bogeys on the track.
Which are the, under carriage wheels.
Um, because the train track, in Mongolia, and Russia is set at a different width, than it is in China.
So they_ what they do, they pick up the whole train.
They disconnect each, carriage.
And, you're in a big sort of, um, hanger.
And they pick up, each carriage, and plunk you back onto another, set of, bogeys.
Which is what they're called.
And, um, all ready for the, the wider, width train track.
This takes about six hours.
And, a lot of hauling about and strange eerie noises at night.
Anyway, so we're back in Erlian, and, um, we pull away out of China.
Which is quite sad for me, because i've been there for quite a long time.
And, um, i'll never forget the, um_ to see, a load of policeman lined up... Uh, at the railway station.
Um, all very solemnly standing there, with, um, old Mao-type communist music blaring, in the background, as the train pulled off into, no-man's land.
And, um, through the China Gate.
It was just so, like, ou- out of a film.
It was, quite, atmospheric.
And then pulling, about an ho_ um, about an hour through Mongoli_ uh, through no-man's land.
We, um, saw the Genghis Khan type, fortress gate.
Um, and that's where we had to go through immigration again.
Um, checking for contraband and, it all so- sort of_ it's like a theatre.
It's quite funny to watch.
And this big babushka lady steps on, and checks everything.
And then, um, going through Mongolia was just, um, plain deserts.
Endless.
It was_ we, actually crossed part of the Gobi, and it's quite, um, yeah it's just- just endless, endless... Expanse of land.
And then, um, again you go through border control.
And you get to the border of m_ Russia.
And then from there it's six days, going through birch trees, all the way to Moscow.
And, you hope, you've got a good company.
Not like i, i was on my own.
Sharing a cabin with, three drunken Russians, eating kippers all day.
Um, kin- kind of a funny experience.
Got to be down, down to earth to, to get on with that, hehe."
"I used to live in Hong Kong on a junk.
In fact i lived there for about six months.
And, um, for the first, few months i went a bit wild.
I used to go out, to parties and clubs all the time, and come rolling back, at about three o'clock in the morning.
Anyway, i have a funny story to tell.
Once when i came back from a no_ notorious district called [Wen Tai], um, i, i got back and it was a very stormy night.
There was lots of_ um, i- it was raining and it was very very dark and_ and, um, to get to the junk, which is positioned in the middle of a bay.
I, um, have to paddle on a little boat.
To get to the boat i'm staying on.
So, um, since it was very windy it was, a big problem to, s- to sail to the junk.
And, um... Um, i eventually got there, and silly_ i sh_ i shouldn't have done this.
But i put the oar, which is the paddle, on the side of the junk [type of boat].
Before getting_ before padlocking myself_ connecting myself to the boat.
And within seconds i was being pushed out to sea again by the wind.
And, um, i was yelling for my friend to wake up.
But he didn't.
It was so stormy and windy, he couldn't hear.
So, i thought, wh- what am i going to do.
I was being pushed out to the South China sea.
And, um, in the dark.
And, all i could think of was sharks and, horrible things like that.
So, um, i acted very quickly.
I, took off my shoes, and jumped into the water, and started swimming wi_ towing the boat behind me.
Ha-ha, this big heavy boat.
And, um, it took me ages and ages to, swim back to the junk.
And, um, it was just such a funny sto_ thing to do.
And then i was_ eventually got onto the_ to the junk.
And my friend woke up and sort said, 'what on earth are you doing.
' With me dripping, with all my clothes on.
I'll never forget that night."
"Years ago when i was a child, um, one of the things that my friends and i liked to do was to go to the movie theater.
And, we went quite often.
You know we would save up money and go.
Well, one day about six of us were all going to the movie theater.
And, um, we get to the, we get to the part where we have to pay for the tickets.
And all but one of us had enough to get in.
And, we all paid and got in.
We didn't realize that this guy was still standing outside.
We saw him through the glass, just standing there looking really sad, that he couldn't get in.
And, we all decided that, we couldn't just let him stand out there.
So we all chipped in a dollar, and, we got him inside.
You know we paid for him.
But that was it.
Now, none of us had any money after that.
Next thing you know, we're going to se- we're going to seat ourselves for the movies.
And the kid who we just paid to get in was nowhere to be found.
He comes and sits next to us, with a large thing of popcorn, and a large soda, and candy.
And we had no idea where he, got it.
He said he had the money for that, but he didn't want to spend it on getting in.
So he actually had the money the whole time and he wound up being the only person eating in the movie theater."
"One of the things that really interests me is, Egyptology.
Or the study of ancient Egypt.
I guess i’m... Kind of addicted to, old things and old ideas.
And, uh, first of all that got me into studying India.
Which at the time i thought was probably some of the oldest groups of, ideas and, and people around.
But then i discovered that, in fact the oldest religious text, or spiritual text, in the, the world, come from ancient Egypt.
And they’re, inscribed on the insides of pyramids and things.
You know the whatever.
So inscribed on the insides of the pyramids, there are things, called the pyramid text.
And they happen to be the oldest religious text that they’ve ever found.
And in fact even though they’re written in stone, on the inside of these great buildings, when you read them, they actually say that they’re copying from manuscripts.
So they’re even older than the pyramids.
Now i guess the pyramids are about... They say about, three and a half thousand B.
C.
So what’s that.
About five and a half thousand years old.
So that’s, that’s kind of pretty old.
And that’s, that’s interesting.
And the, and the ideas themselves are,also you know when you read them, they’re quite, they’re quite complicated and quite strange.
But they’re they’re sophisticated.
The, Egyptians love nature.
They had a great sort of connection with, with nature.
And they thought that their_ whole of their country in fact was, kind of a special place.
It was a very special place which was closer, to the gods.
That the gods actually lived there.
They called it the Temple of the Cosmos almost.
As if it was a_ and, and lots of people after them actually believed them in this.
That there was something special about, about Egypt and the landscape and the, the lights ,and the, elements there, that set it apart from any other place.
They, didn’t believe in just one principle, one sort of, uh, god or goddess.
Which kind of makes them a bit different to a lot of other people around the world.
They kind of thought that, there were lots and lots of gods and goddesses and things.
In fact i, i believe there’s, there’s about a hundred and fifty, two hundred different spirits and gods that you could find in the Egyptian religion.
And that’s a bit, complicated really.
Yo_ you know i can’t get my head around that.
And i don’t think the Egyptians could really get their heads around it.
So they kind of organized them into family groups.
So they sort of understood the gods as being a kind of a family of, uh, you know that starts with_ well it starts with one, maybe one principle.
Which is always thought of as very mysterious and abstract.
Nobody can understand that.
And then it kind of splits up and the family grows up.
And you get, so kind of.
Uh.
You know, a god and a goddess and they have children.
You’ve got this kind of family of about eight or nine, gods and goddesses.
And just like any other family where you’ll get good families don’t you.
And you get kind of bad families.
So kind of good things go on in the family.
And then you get the kind of real things, the real arguments and the, the wicked uncles and the kind of jealous sons, and all that sort of stuff.
And it just strikes me as kind of quite a... Quite easy to cope with really as a, as as a set of spiritual ideas.
It’s because you know everybody’s got a family and you kind of relate to it.
So that’s, that’s basically how, how, how they approach the world i mean i guess they were trying to become_ they were very influenced by the elements and by nature, right.
And, so, so it’s a kind natural religion if you like.
And that, that appeals to me quite a lot as well.
Yeah i, i think i would just say that, i_ for me the appeal of, of the, of the Egyptian religion is the fact that, they think the world is quite complicated.
And they don’t try and break it down, uh, or, or reduce it.
It’s just one principle.
And that one principle is, is, is what governs everything.
They say the world is complicated therefore the world of human beings and the world of spirituality is also complicated.
And has to be represented by lots of different things.
Uh, and that to me seems a more sophisticated way of looking at the world than some of the ones that maybe we were taught when we were children."
"Well I fir- I first came to Oxford in fact to study, uh, Ayuravedic Medicine.
Which may seem a bit strange that_ to, to, to come to the centre of learning to study something that’s so weird.
Anyway i, I better explain what Ayuravedic Medicine is.
Ayuravada literally means the science of longevity.
By medical science, the science that keeps people alive for as long as possible.
And it’s actually, um, an eastern system of medicine from India.
Although it’s, it's practised in some form or other all over.
Uh, I think even in in China and Japan people, study some form of it.
But certainly in Tibet and South India and stuff.
It’s what, is called, uh, I supposed a complementary medical system now.
Uh, it’s something that, most medicine people use the western system obviously, cause it’s so successful and it’s so good at what it does.
But there are certain areas of, even high-tech medicine, that it’s, it’s maybe not so good dealing with maybe allergies or something like that.
And over the last, maybe, twenty years or something people have started looking at older systems of medicine, and healing, and ideas and thinking, maybe there’s something still to be found there.
And in fact they, they’ve found a lot of, new drugs and new techniques, that have been, sort of modernised, and used in Western medicine.
So Ayuravedic, it might surprise you, is a very, very old system.
I mean it’s about, oh, it’s maybe three, three or four thousand years old.
They’ve been practising it in some form or other.
Obviously it’s developed.
And it’s mainly based around the idea that what makes you ill is, is probably what you eat.
It’s eating the_ either eating maybe not enough or too much.
But also the type of things that you eat.
So where you live, maybe you should, think about eating things that are appropriate to where you are, or to your temperament, or whatever.
So that’s it’s, it’s core.
And from that the developed quite, uh, quite a complicated system, that is main_ still mainly practised in India but, in America and, in, in Britain over the last few years people have, um, the practitioners from those countries have been coming here and practising it.
So that’s, that’s Ayuraveda.
I’ve been_ i’m not a practitioner of Ayuraveda.
I’ve been interested in, kind of Eastern philosophy.
So I studied the kind of history of it.
And,and the basic core philosophical ideas.
And I actually wrote a little kind of introduction to it.
But it’s something that is, is, you know, I mean it’s true isn’t it.
That what you eat does make you, is gonna make you ill, or is gonna make you better.
So basically it’s a sensible system.
It’s not, it’s not crazy or anything.
In fact to practice Ayuraveda the_ you have to go through a, a training that is at least as long as, as any physician.
It can be at least seven years before you’re, you’re really qualified to be let loose on a_ on someone with a with an illness.
So i,t it’s something that’s increasing in popularity.
Along with other sort of forms of alternative medicine.
N, n, n, like acupuncture or whatever_ in fact acupuncture is, is derived from_ some of the principles acupuncture are derived from Ayuravedic medicine.
Uh, and some of the herbs used in in Chinese medicine, actually come from India.
And from the Chinese system.
So these ideas have been around a long time.
And they’re being revived now.
Uh, and it’s, it’s one thing that you might hear about.
So that’s, that’s Ayuravedic Medicine medicine."
"There once was a man of very great wealth.
He had homes in town as well as country.
He had... Great amounts of gold, silver.
Great furniture.
And many servants to make him wonderful food.
However, this very rich man had a beard which was, blue colored.
So striking was it in its blue color, that he came to be known as Bluebeard.
Bluebeard had a neighbor who had two daughters and he desired, to marry one of these daughters.
He told the mother, that she could choose whichever daughter she was to give to him.
However, both these daughters despised the idea of marrying Bluebeard.
They thought him completely hideous and ugly, with his blue colored beard.
So in order to win their approval and favor Bluebeard invited the two daughters, and the mother, on a vacation to one of his country homes.
They accepted.
And for several weeks he entertained them.
Going on hunts, having parties, having dances, and enjoying wonderful food.
Soon one of the daughters came to think that his blue beard was not so ugly.
So shortly after, this daughter was married to Bluebeard.
Shortly after being married, Bluebeard said to his new wife, ""i must leave you.
I must go on business into the country and I will be away for a few weeks.
However I will leave you with all the keys to my house.
You will have access to all the rooMs  all the chests of gold, to the wine cellar, to all the carriages.
You will be able to tell all the servants to follow your whiMs  please invite all your friends, to the estate, and entertain yourself every day and every night.
However there is one exception to the use of all the keys to my house.
There is one key to a small closet, in one of the hallways.
And you must never use this key to enter that closet.
If you do, my anger and my wrath will know no exception and you will greatly regret your decision to enter that closet.""  the new wife agreed to what Bluebeard had said, and was very excited about the weeks to follow.
She invited over many of her friends, including her sister.
She entertained herself every day and every night.
She used the keys to go into all the rooms exploring all the wealth and riches that her new husband Bluebeard, had brought into her life.
She and all her friends explored all the rooms, and looked at all the furniture, and gold, and silver that Bluebeard had provided for her new life.many days passed.
There were many parties, many dances.
However towards the end of the few weeks when Bluebeard was away.
His new wife began to become, completely overcome by the_ a great and insatiable curiosity to look in that closet door.
She had explored all the rooms, and seen all the w- the wealth and riches of her new husband.
However even, all that wealth could not appease her curiosity to look in that one closet door... So finally on the last day of Bluebeard's trip away, she took that key to the closet.
Snuck away from her guests and her sister.
Slipped the key into the, keyhole of the closet door, and slowly opened the door.
At first she could not see very well.
There was not a lot of light in the room... Gradually she was able to see in the room.
On the floor, to her horror and shock was clotted dried old blood.
Then to her even great terror... The room was lined with dead bodies.
The dead bodies of Bluebeard's former wives.
He had been married before, and these were where the bodies of these women had ended up.
This most recent wife knew Bluebeard's secret.
She knew why she had been so ordered, to not enter the closet room.
So, overcome by horror she dropped the key and it fell into some of the blood.
She managed to gather herself together.
Picked up the key and... Locked the door behind her.
However the key was still covered with the blood.
She was worried that Bluebeard would see this blood on the key, and kn- know what had happened.
She tried, again and again to clean the key.
Washing it.
Scrubbing it.
Trying to remove the blood.
Even if she could remove the blood from one side of the key, it would appear again on the other side of the key.
It was a magic key.
There was no way that she could remove the blood and keep Bluebeard from knowing what had happened.
This was the day that Bluebeard would return.
That evening Bluebeard returned from his trip, and called out to his new wife ""come to me and tell me how your few weeks have been.
Have you explored all the rooms.
May I have my keys back.""  the new wife gave back Bluebeard the keys.
However there was one missing.
The key to that small closet, where his former wives' bodies lay.
Bluebeard immediately noticed this.
And he guessed what had happened.
He said, ""my wife where is the key to the small closet room.
Will you not return that key as well.""  the wife pretended not to know what had happened."" oh I did not know that I did not return that key to you, perhaps it is upstairs.
I shall go get it for you.""  the wife did not know what to do.
She was so terrified that she too would be killed by Bluebeard, and end up in that small room.
After much delay.
After much hesitation and great worry, finally she brought the key back to Bluebeard.
Handing it to him he saw the blood on the key."" what is this my wife.
Have you entered that closet room which I have told you not to enter.
Do you not know that my anger and wrath will know no mercy.""  Bluebeard's new wife fell to his feet.
Begging_ imploring him, ""oh my husband, please have mercy upon me.
Do not kill me like your other wives.
Please I beg you do not kill me.""  Bluebeard, responded in an angry voice, ""no.
I shall have no mercy.
You knew what the consequences would be.
You have disobeyed my orders.
Now I shall have no mercy, and I must kill you.""  Bluebeard drew his sword and held it above his head, ready to strike and kill his new wife.
She called out again, ""Bluebeard please please offer me just a few minutes to make to my last prayers.""  her face was so pitiful.
Her eyes so full of tears, and her pleading so heartfelt, that Bluebeard consented.
He said, ""fine, you will have five minutes, but then I shall kill you."" quickly she ran up stairs.
She called out to her sister who was still at her home."" oh sister please go to the top of the tower and see if my brothers are coming.
I know that they were meant to visit today.
Please see if they are far off, riding on their horses.
Perhaps you can make a sign for them to ride faster.""  the sister went to the top of the tower and she looked out.
She called back, ""i only see the sun in the sky and the green grass on the ground.""  Bluebeard's wife called back, ""please, please look again.
Are they coming"".
Her sister replied again, ""only I see the sun in the sky and the green grass on the ground.""  Bluebeard's wife did not know what to do.
Bluebeard was calling out to her, ""come here my wife.
Now you must die.
You have disobeyed me and you must suffer the consequences.""  Bluebeard's wife called out one last time, ""oh sister, do you not see my brothers coming.
Do you not see them far off.
Can you not make a sign so that they can ride faster on their horses.""  finally her sister replied, ""i see two men on two horses, they are very far off though.""  Bluebeard's wife felt perhaps there was some hope.
She left her room and went back down to Bluebeard.
She fell again at his feet, pleading and crying out to him, ""oh, Bluebeard please wait, please do not kill me right away.
Please just a few more m- moments to make my prayers.""  however, Bluebeard lifted his sword and said to her, ""no.
Now is the time that you must die.""  just as his sword was to come down upon her, there was a great knocking at the door.
The door burst open and Bluebeard's wife's two brothers burst in.
Both of her brothers held their swords ready.
They ran at Bluebeard.
He saw them and ran away, fearing for his own life.
The brothers immediately came upon Bluebeard and killed him.
Running their swords into his body.
Bluebeard's wife was so overcome with grief, that she lay on the floor crying for quite a while.
However, her evil husband was finally dead, and she was free from his wrath and his anger.
She took the great wealth from his homes and was able to support her sister, and herself, and all her friends.
And they quite happily lived there ever after. "
"Uh, first of all first my family basically... It's really just my immediate family.
My mother father and brother.
Uh, we moved away from the rest of our extended family.
Uh, they are all in Chicago.
We moved to New Jersey.
And so really the only family I ever grew up with, was the people around me.
And so, I mean my immediate family, like I said.
So I've got my brother.
He is, a little over two years older than me.
His name is Ben.
He's also in college right now.
He's gonna be a_ some kind of math science major.
I honestly don't even know.
But, uh, we definitely grew up with similar interests.
People always they ask,you know, ""did you fight with your brother when you grew up.
Did you, uh, you know, does he beat you up a lot.""  cuz, you know, he's older, and that's the thing and how, that's just how it works.
They beat you up.
And he never really did.
He just uh_i mean, I gotta say, i, I actually admire my brother a lot because he'd always be the one_ I almost like followed in his like_ I didn't just follow in his foot steps exactly.
But I mean, you know, up through high school, there's not many variations on experiences you can do.
As far as like social life in the town, a small town.
So he'd_ he always did everything first.
And so when I'd get_ I would go to do something, and he'd already have been there.
He knew everybody.
Because my brother, he didn't start_ he, uh, started off being a very shy kid.
Not until, uh, sophomore year in high school did he get to be, very outgoing.
So he knew every but_ but that's when it counted, when he was in high school and he knew everybody.
And it was just_ it made everything so much easier for me.
So he's definitely a really good guy.
Definitely we share a lot of interests together.
And, uh, we don't actually hang out that much.
But, I mean we, we could.
And we have no_ and we do sometimes and we always had a good time.
Then I've got my mom... Who definitely_ tennis is her favorite aspect of life.
She plays tennis, honestly I think three or four times a week.
She's always thinking about tennis.
She's always coming back from playing a match in tennis.
She can find the most obscure tennis tournaments to watch, on T-V.
Uh... She went to college she went_  met my dad in college.
That's how they met.
_ I thought that was pretty funny because, I just recently found out that their first date was to see the movie Patton, which is like a war movie, I think.
And it didn't make any_ it didn't sound very romantic.
But they liked it, I guess.
And they seem'd to like each other.
And so, uh, she works part time jobs every now and then.
Don't really need to.
My dad makes a good deal of money, and, uh, he can pretty much support us on that.
He has pretty good job security.
So we really didn't, really have to worry about that.
And I would definitely say she's done a good job raising us.
Uh, I mean just, no complaints.
Like_ the one thing I got my_ me and my dad are almost completely the same, in that, we are very laid back.
Not many things really bother us.
But as a businessman he basically schmoozes all the time now.
Just, he talks to them them a lot.
You know, wins them over towards his favor.
But it's really_ that's, that's, that's what he does.
I asked, him what he does.
He has a book called Schmoozing.
He didn't write it but, you know, he' got a book on it.
And so we're very laid back.
It's like things, they just bounce off us.
We don't really care.
The little things in life normally_ I mean of course they do build up sometimes.
But, most of the time we just like, ""yeah whatever.""  my mum and my brother, both very short tempered.
If something goes wrong.
They get _ they're mad.
And they're like_ they get in fi- so, they fight with each other a lot.
It used to be bad, now it got a lot better.
And they don't_ it's not_ it used to be kind of awkward for me, you know, always being the younger son and, have my mom be mad at my brother.
And my dad, has to be on my mom's side.
But, but, of course, you know, he, he personally doesn't care that much.
But, you know, he has to be because he's a parent, the parental role, has to be the good father.
But, uh, yeah it doesn't, it doesn't really affect me anymore.
They pretty much get along really good with it now.
And it's all pretty good.
But_ and we used to_ I think, actually probably one of the reasons they  get along much better now, is we don't do forced family events.
We like have to go and spend days together.
Every now and then we'll s- we'll say we're gonna have dinner tonight, and that'll be it.
And when_ since we haven't seen each other in a long time, we haven't been together.
And haven't done that many things together in a long time there's always something to say.
And it- it's pretty good.
It's a good life with my good family.
I like them."
"Um in this lecture, i would like to, talk a- about Britain in eighteen-fifteen.
Um... This was after the Battle of Waterloo, and the defeat of the, uh, French.
That_ the end of the Napoleonic Wars.
The population of Britain, England and Scotland, was_ uh, sorry England Scotland and Wales, um, was about thirteen million.
Which was a quarter of the, present population.
And at that time the population was increasing very quickly.
And in fact it went on and by eighteen-seventy-one it had doubled.
And there were three reasons for this, rapid increase in population.
Firstly, um, more babies, uh, lived to grow up and become adults.
And secondly, uh, people were living longer.
And thirdly, uh, many immigrants were coming in to Britain from Ireland.
Um, uh, people were generally better fed, um, better clothed and better housed.
And more healthy than they had been, in the past.
However, although people were more healthy than they had been before, by modern standards, uh, conditions were still very bad indeed.
[Throat clear] many people still worked on the land.
Uh, but towns were growing rapidly.
Uh, uh,by the middle of the nineteenth century, more people were living in the towns than in the land.
And, for example, between eighteen-hundred and eighteen-thirty, i- in the thirty-year period, uh, many towns doubled in size.
Birmingham, Sheffield ,Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester all doubled in size during that time.
In eighteen-thirty, um, Bradford, wh- which is my hometown, Bradford was the fastest growing town in the world.
Um, by eighteen-fifteen, London already had a population of over a million people.
Uh, but... At this time, most of the people living in the towns, had not been born there.
But had been born in the country and had later moved to the new towns.
The economy was growing very rapidly.
Um, at that time, the, the largest industry was cotton.
The cotton mills of Lancashire were importing raw cotton from the United States.
And, making that into cloth.
And then exporting the cloth all over the world.
Also important were, um, coal, iron, uh, and engineering industries.
Uh, the countryside too had changed, uh, very much.
There were now no large open fields.
But many small fields with, uh, fences around them, typical of the e- English countryside of today in fact.
Um, improved methods of agriculture, uh, needed less labour.
And more land was now in the hands of rich men.
Those poor people in the countryside who had no land were very poor i-indeed.
At that time, laws were very strict.
The criminal law.
Um, you could be sentenced to death for about two-hundred, uh, different offences.
For example pick pocketi- pick pocketing or stealing sheep.
Um, the trouble of course was that there were no police ha-ha so a criminal had very little chance of being caught.
Another punishment common, uh, uh, at the time was transportation.
That is sending people away, uh, to Australia, a- at the time.
Um, you could get seven years transportation, for catching a wild rabbit on someone's private land.
Um, London, of course, ha- had special crime problems because it had such a large population, and it had no police force.
This period around eighteen-fifteen, is often called the Regency.
Uh, it was a period of outlandish fashions a- among the upper classes.
And, uh, writers such as Jane Austin and Sir Walter Scott, were writing their famous novels for those people who were educated enough to read.
However most people were probably more interested in horse racing and boxing, than i- in literature.
The king was George the third, he reigned from seventeen-sixty to eighteen-twenty, but for most of that_ or much of that time he was mentally ill.
And he frequently had, um, fits of madness.
Um, by eighteen-eleven his son had become the permanent Regent.
I mean ruling in his place, his father was still technically the king, but th- the son wa- was ruling.
And the political system was still the same system that had been founded in sixteen-eighty-eight.
When William and Mary had, um, come to the throne.
Um... The parliament wa- was in dreadful need of reform.
The distribution of seats... Um, uh, the areas of the country that could send a member to parliament_te-  the seats the distribution was very uneven.
Due to the fact that the population had changed so much, because of the agricultural revolution and the and industrial revolutions.
And many of the large new towns didn't send any representatives to parliament.
Whereas many old villages with only a small population might have sent two.
Uh, in one case, there was an old village, um, still sent two members of parliament_ two members to parliament.
Even though there was no population left in the village.
No one for the people to represent.
Um, very few people had the right to vote.
And most of those who could vote would sell their vote to the highest price.
It was obvious that the, um, parliament would have to be reformed.
And more people had to be given th- the right to vote.
And in eighteen- thirty-two, a new law was passed to change all this.
And, uh, i- in eighteen-thirty-two, the middle class were given the right to vote.
Um, at this time_ in eighteen- fifteen at this time, um, internationally Britain was in a very strong position.
And France was defeated i- in the Napoleonic Wars.
And Germany consisted of about thirty small, uh, states.
And none of them very powerful.
Italy was not united, and was divided into six small states for example.
East Europe was still almost entirely agricultural.
And Russia was still very backward.
Um, this was a chance for Britain to take advantage of her, economic development.
And the merchants, bankers and manufacturers were all ready.
Um, for the next hundred years or so, a- after eighteen- fifteen, Britain dominated world trade.
And was by far the most powerful country in the world.
And compared to other countries at the time the British government, uh, was actually very liberal.
And many people at the time, uh, thought that the secret of British success was somehow the combination of a rather_ of liberal democracy with capitalist development.
And so many other countries, a- a- attempted to imitate this.
And they were often successful of course with the economic development.
But perhaps, uh, less successful in trying to imitate British democracy.
Um, so eighteen-fifteen was a, a time where we have great success.
But also serious social probleMs  um... The economic changes had changed British society.
Um, at the same time the- the American and French revolutions had set in motion new ideas about political freedom.
Um, twenty-five years of war with France, ha- had helped very much to speed up the process of industrialisation.
But at the same time had held back the necessary social, uh, and political reforMs  			"
"In this lecture, i'd like to talk about the period from eighteen fifteen to nineteen fourteen.
Um, which was the period of British greatness.
During this century, Britain was without doubt the most powerful country in the world.
The city of London, was the financial centre of the world.
British factories produced goods for sale in every continent.
And the British navy dominated the oceans of the world.
During this period, the nineteenth century, there were many wars in Europe.
But Britain was not really involved, um, i- in any of them.
For the whole of the period from eighteen-fifteen to nineteen-fourteen, um, this was a period of peace for Britain.
And she was involved in no major wars.
Of course, the British empire increased in size very much during this_ the nineteenth century.
And so Britain was often involved in, in wars, small wars.
But these were usually small, local and of short duration.
Although Britain produced many, um,great men during this period.
Many famous people.
The person who is usually close_ most closely associated with nineteenth century Britain, is Queen Victoria.
[Throat clear] she became queen in, eighteen thirty-seven at the age of eighteen.
And died in nineteen oh one.
She was queen for sixty-four years.
She was a small lady with a very strong will.
And she married a German prince, Albert.
Who she loved very much.
And they had many children.
Uh, Albert died in eighteen sixty-one, when Victoria was only forty-two years old.
And she was heartbroken.
Uh, her children of course were all married to other European royal families.
And_ uh, so that when she eventually dec_ died in nineteen oh one, Victoria was grandmother to most of the kings and queens of Europe.
Um, the Victorian age, uh, was one of great change.
Political, social and economic.
These changes in Britain were usually peaceful.
Unlike the changes i- in most European countries.
Um, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, uh, i- in eighteen fifteen say.
Britain was still, still largely an aristocratic agricultural country.
By nineteen fourteen, Britain was a modern state.
Parliament was reformed three times during this period.
First in eighteen thirty-two and then twice again.
Um, of course, women didn't get the vote, uh, until much later.
Until  nineteen eighteen, in fact.
But during the nineteenth century, the ordinary working man became more and more involved in the political system.
And by eighteen eighty-four almost all working men had the right to vote.
Uh, the terrible conditions i- in mines and factories were slowly improved by laws passed by parliament.
Of course, i- in nineteen fourteen, conditions were still bad, by modern standards.
But they were still much better than they had been a- at the start of the nineteenth century.
Uh, many changes were made in, public health and education.
Um, many terrible diseases were eradicated.
And elementary education was made compulsory for everyone.
Um, people were living longer, and enjoying a better quality of life than ever before.
During this period, uh, many of the things we regard as part of modern life were invented or developed.
Um, trains, cars, iron ships, and even aeroplanes.
The telegraph, connected distant parts of the world together.
The telephone, photography, police forces, u-underground sewage systems, gramophones and so much more, were either invented or developed in this period.
However, a- amongst most modern British people the Victorian age is remembered most a- a- as a time o- of sexual repression.
It was impossible, during this time to discuss sexual matters in public.
And almost impossible, to discuss them in private.
To talk about underwear.
Underclothes for example was considered shocking.
And even such words as legs or, navel um, had to be avoided.
Sex itself was, uh, not considered a pleasure, but a duty.
And, uh, for women i- i- it was an unpleasant duty necessary to produce children.
But despite this, though, hehe, most families were very large.
A- and ten children was quite common during, the nineteenth century.
And the population wa- was increasing all during this period.
As the century progressed other countries such as Germany, Italy and the United States started to become, u- unified and industrialised.
As they became more powerful, they started to look for overseas colonies, of course.
And then, from eighteen-seventy to nineteen-fourteen,for example, almost the whole of Africa was divided up, between the European powers.
Um, Eastern Asia too became an area in which the powerful countries competed to gain new colonies.
Um, and this competition between these powerful countries led to a great deal of, of bad feeling between them.
And at the same time, i- in Europe the large Turkish empires and the, uh, Austrian empires were,  were breaking up.
A- a- and this resulted i- in a very unstable political situation i- in Europe.
Germany was very worried about Russia and France.
A- a- and so Germany made an alliance with Italy and Austria.
And this of course led Russia and France, uh, to make an alliance, uh, together, between themselves, to defend themselves against Germany.
And then at the same time, Britain was also very worried about Germany and was becoming much closer to France.
And this was, uh, an inherently dangerous situation.
It meant that if, if two countries in Europe started a war together.
All the other countries, wou- would have to become involved too, because of the, uh, alliances and agreements between the various countries, uh, to help each other.
And... If there was a war, of course, it would be the first modern war.
And i think, uh, at that time no one realised just how terrible it would be.
And then on the twenty-eighth of June nineteen fourteen, an Austrian duke, uh, was murdered in Yugoslavia.
And this, uh, caused a series of events which led to war throughout Europe.
And eventually to war throughout most of the world, um, the First World War."
"A few months ago i was living in Bangkok, uh, with my father and a friend of his.
Who was_ he had lived in Cambodia, for a few years, uh, when the U-N was running a transitional government there.
So, things were still quite hairy then, and not many tourists had been able to go there.
But this guy, his name’s David, he absolutely loved Cambodia.
And he had managed to persuade me to go.
So i jumped on a plane from Bangkok, just over the border, and went to Phnom-Penh.
Which is a beautiful city.
It’s built at the confluence of four rivers, the Mekong, the Tonle Sap and the Bassac.
And the Tonle Sap, um, flows from an enormous lake in the middle of Cambodia called the Tonle Sap Lake.
And, the Tonle Sap River, which joins the lake to the Mekong, flows both ways.
And i was there just after there’d been a festival, in which the current reversed direction.
And when it reverses direction they’re_ it brings all the fish out of the great lake through this, uh, narrow opening into the Mekong at Phnom Penh.
And so all the fisherman are out there.
Like it’s written in some legends that in the, good fishing years you can actually walk across the river on catfish.
So i spent a couple of days in Phnom Penh, watching the, watching the remains of this festival.
And then i took a flight up to the temples at Ankor Wat which, uh, used to be the centre of an empire in, uh, Southeast Asia.
Angkor Wat was built in, i think the twelfth century.
And it’s supposed to be the largest, uh, religious building in the world.
And it’s absolutely magnificent.
Some of the uh_ i_ there are several old cities, built around there.
One of them Angkor Thom has inside it a temple.
I think it’s called Preah Khan.
Haha, i can’t quite remember.
But this temple is, um, has been so deeply inside the jungle for so many hundreds of years, that you have there enormous trees.
Like, some of the biggest trees i’ve ever seen growing out of the old temple.
The, the roots coming down into the, into the rocks, and so on and so forth.
It’s real Indian_ Indiana Jones country.
It's, it’s wonderful stuff.
Now just recently because i liked, uh, Cambodia so much, i decided to fi_ try and find a job there.
And i ended up volunteering to go and work with a, a Thai NGO, for three months.
And i taught English there.
And, uh, i had lots of opportunities to go out into the countryside and see some of the more remote temples.
And, uh, just a couple of weeks before i left, i managed to go and see, uh, ah Bayon style temple, which was building in the thirteenth century, out in the far west of the country.
Which is, uh, still a little bit hairy.
We had to tie a yellow ribbon around the, uh, wing mirror of our car, to show sympathy for the Khmer Rouge, to get out there.
But this temple was quite special because it was, uh, built to commemorate one of the king’s son’s death in battle.
And around the perimeter of this temple, which is about two square kilometres this temple.
Around the perimeter, they have carved, um, the bas reliefs of what the battle would have looked like.
And, uh, lots of_ some of the battle was on, uh, water as well.
Which is very unusual, because we don’t know very much about the Khmer’s, which is the name of this empire, and their, their boats.
We know that they were_ used the Mekong for trade.
But we know virtually nothing about what they actually traded or, how, and why.
So this temple’s very important from that point of view.
But unfortunately, because it’s so close to the Thai border.
It’s actually Bangkok then it is to Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
And, um, both sides in the civil war, and the Thai army, have been stealing bits,  and selling them at department stores, in Bangkok.
So the one bas relief, which i really wanted to see, had unfortunately been stolen, about a week before i got there.
But it’s still a marvellous temple.
And there’s still, uh, quite a few hundred meters of bas reliefs remaining out in the jungle.
Yes.
It’s a Bayon temple.
Which is remarkable because, it has, um, lots and lots of towers.
Each would be about ten meters tall, and have_ with foursided_ its four sides have a clock.
Like a clock tower.
But instead of a clock face, it has the face of, of one of the emperors.
But nobody’s actually quite sure who it is.
But it’s known that this emperor was a devote Buddhist.
So it could be the face of Buddha, or it could be the face of this king, who may have mistaken himself for Buddha.
He was a bit of a megalomaniac.
Or it_ well nobody really quite knows, who this face is supposed to represent.
But he has this, really eerie and enigmatic smile.
From_ the face is about four meters, high.
These faces are, staring down at you from all corners of the temple.
It’s really remarkable.
Remarkable place to visit.
And in the next couple of years now that things are dying down there, um, it should become really very safe to go there.
And i expect to see it_ you could probably get there, actually, uh, doing a day trip from Bangkok.
So, it should get a real big tourist boom.
And i think that could be very valuable to the people who live in that area."
"One of the most wonderful and memorable experiences when i traveled to France a few months ago.
Uh, one of the most wonderful experiences that i had, was going to, Chartres Cathedral which is about, oh, half an hour or forty minutes outside of Paris.
And it was constructed, beginning in the late twelfth century, in honor of the Virgin Mary.
They had a very important relic there, uh... Which was, uh, supposed to be her, veil.
The Virgin Mary's veil when she gave birth to Christ.
And people were very proud of having this relic.
Uh, and it was housed in... At least one or two churches before, the main cathedral was built.
And, the last one before it was built was destroyed in a fire.
And, people were very upset about this fire.
But they were overjoyed, when they heard that this veil, this sacred veil, had survived.
And so, they, almost immediately decided that they would build an even grander cathedral, in, in its place to house this relic and to give honor to the Virgin Mary, and to God, and to Mary's son Jesus Christ.
So... They worked on this cathedral for many decades.
And... Money came in from everywhere.
Not just from, Chart- not just from the Chartres area, not just from France, but from England and other countries as well.
Because... Everyone all Catholic people at that time honored the Virgin Mary.
And they... They wanted to show their honor for her, and respect by contributing to her cathedral.
So even, countries that... Did not like France like England sent money, and, and provisions for this to be built.
And, everyone in Chartres, almost everyone, was, taking part in building this cathedral or supporting the people who did.
Uh, the windows, the windows in the cathedral you have, sections at the bottom of the windows.
And the windows would deal like tr- with traditional subjects like, the fall of ma- the fall of Adam or, Noah's Ark or the crucifixion of Jesus or the life of Mary.
But in the bottom of these windows you would see, the bakers at work, or you would see the carpenters.
And in each of those windows if you saw carpenters in a window you_ that would say the carpenters were the donors, for that particular window.
They got together and they came up with the money for that window.
And they were honored, by the makers of the stained glass by putting, their pictures in that window.
And i just think that is a wonderful wonderful thing.
Uh... And it's not just wonderfu- and what_ it's not just wonderful for, these little touches but for the over_ and, and that's_ i'm just talking about that in a small scale.
But on a large scale, the effect of the stained glass windows in Chartres is just, extraordinary.
It's, it's like a cathedral of light.
The stained glass windows are some of the best preserved in Europe.
And... The_ not just the pictures but the combination of the colors, when the sun comes in through the windows, it's, it's just glorious, it's like a rainbow.
Um, and also when you look, uh, when you look closely at each window, each of the windows they're very finely done.
And you can actually see what they are depicting from the floor.
You can see what's going on.
Uh, not like_ there's another cath- there's another chapel i went to called Saint Chapel in Paris.
Now that was also extraordinary.
And the, the colors were also magnificent.
But you could not see the_ you could not see what was going on.
The windows were too, high off the ground to really appreciate what was going on in those windows.
Whereas Chartres, uh, you could, you could get effect of both.
You could have this extraordinary effect of the, uh, the colors and the st- the colors of the stained glass abstractly, but also, see... Visibly eheh see unaided the Virgin Mary and Child.
You could see the life of Christ.
You could see these things, from the ground.
And i think that's important because, stained glass windows were a way of teaching, the illiterate about their faith.
And to have those things visible... I think would have been a very important thing.
Whereas Saint Chapel in Paris, was not built for the illiterate, it was built for the king and his family.
And so, they would have had more access.
They, they would not have been hindered in their faith or learning, by the, distance of these windows from the ground.
But Chartres is much more_ in many ways a much more accessible place.
And a beautiful place too.
And i would, recommend anyone in the Paris area to go to Chartres, and to experience, the glories of the of the stained glass and the cathedral itself.
Which is one of the, one of the finest in Europe."
"There are many children, who come from very poor families in Kenya.
Or, families that don't have any food or shelter, or clothes to offer them.
And unfortunately the cycle of poverty cannot be broken because the children do not go to school.
Um, many of these children can be found in the streets of Nairobi.
Loitering, begging, or snatching valuables from tourists.
And this has given Kenya a very bad reputation in that_ in that, uh, yeah, because of the, the children snatching these things from them.
And uh... These children i realise that they required help to get out of the, situation that they were in.
So... At the time i was working as a nurse.
Between 1991 and 1997.
While working as a nurse i had to go through the streets of Nairobi every day to get home.
And i'll_ i will talk to these two children that i found on the streets begging.
And find out where their parents were.
And if they could be helped in any way, to get a job, or help the children to get off the streets.
There was a society called Ndugu Society that used to, take in these children and give them a home in a children's home outside Nairobi.
The only problem was they used to separate the boys from the girls.
The boys were taken to a totally different home from the girls.
And, um, but it was better than having the children on the streets.
So, um, i would talk to the children, and if the parents could not be traced.
I would see the children everyday and give them food.
And talk to them about joining Ndugu Society.
And they wi_ where they will be given a place to, sleep.
They will give_ be given regular meals.
They could have a bath.
And they're not restricted.
They can come out of that place any time they want to.
And many of the children actually liked being there.
And they liked being taken care of.
There were m- mothers who_ foster mothers who used to look after groups of nine children.
And... Every child had somebody that they could call mom.
And they used to be taken off the streets and back into school.
And most of those children were very intelligent.
They used to end up going all the way through to university.
Get a university education and, get a good job afterwards.
So that the cycle of poverty was brokennow, the children, have all sorts of things_ all sorts of bad things happening to them.
The people who exploit them.
The little girls, get raped on the streets at night.
Um, the boys also have the same problem.
And, some people even take them_ kidnap them and keep them fo_ as their own children.
Or, keep them as little slaves.
And, uh, we're trying to break that, and look after the children and make sure that they're well taken care of so that they, they may have a future."
"I'd like to talk about my childhood.
I grew up in a polygamous family.
My father had a total of three wives, by the time I left home.
My mother was the first wife and had six children.
It would have been nine, but three of them died because, she was expected to have children, so, often and so frequently_ close to each other.
So she lost some of them.
So (xx xx) I was the third child, in the middle of, six children.
I was not the eldest girl.
I was not the youngest.
I wasn't a_ I wasn't a boy.
There was nothing special about me.
So I thought my mum didn't love me.
And, around_ well I wasn't far from where i_ far from wrong.
My, my father was, uh, very really at home.
And my mum used to beat me a lot.
But I still loved her, and I still love her to this day.
Um, we had, um_ I had two sisters.
Two older sisters.
And, in the African family they were expected to do the cooking.
So my work was to gather the food from the garden.
They used to get the xx, the, the cabbages.
That was my work.
To  dig them out of the ground, and bring them home for cooking.
And we all went to school together.
Uh, unfortunately_ I say unfortunately because this was a problem.
I was the brightest star in the family.
And, they didn't like me for that.
So, um, I had, um, two younger brothers.
And, they're the ones that are loved most in the family.
Um, my elder sisters, never liked the whole lot of us.
Um, they didn't like my brothers or me.
Because my father, sort of, preferred_ he liked us better than he liked my elder sisters.
Um... I had a stepmother who used to torture us.
At some point in life my dad decided to get rid of her.
So he sent my stepmother to live in the house she used to live in before he married her.
And, he sent all of us children_ my mum's children to live with her.
So, she used to poison us.
She used go to, um, African medicine man, and get some poison to put in our food.
And it was supposed to destroy our brains so that we weren't so good at our class work in school, because we were beating her children.
But it didn't work.
Um, e- every day, um, she used to beat us on our way_ before we'd go to school.
And we used to be beaten every morning and every evening.
Um, we used to have our meals while sitting on the floor.
While her children sat on the dining, the dining table.
But that didn't really matter to us.
What mattered is that we had each other.
We knew my mum loved us, even if she wasn't with us.
Some_ many times we'd go to school without any lunch, but we got used to it.
And, our life was generally terrible.
We lived on an estate where, children were mainly_ it was mainly middle class people who lived there.
But, we didn't dress like them, and we used to get teased.
Somehow we had to live with that.
Uh, one day we got help in the form of my dad's cousin, who came to live with us as a live-in maid.
And she is the one who exposed what was happening to us.
The poisoning and the beating.
Then my father took us back.
So we went back to live with him.
Now_ um, we used to be made to work very hard as children.
In the African home, we had to go to the garden.
And, the garden there is called the Shamba, in Swahili.
And everybody had to go to the Shamba.
We had to take manure from where the cattle slept at night.
And take it to_ form a pile so that it would dry up and be ready to be spread in the garden.
I had to do that.
Spread the manure in the garden.
I had to dig the garden, and do the planting.
Um, weeding and harvesting.
That was work used to, to do in our school holidays.
Um, everybody was supposed to do this.
But my elder sister didn't used to do it.
Because she felt it was, dirty work.
And she didn't want to go to the garden.
So she used to go_ look af_ she look after the house.
She used to wash the floor, the dishes, cook the food.
And then she would go out to meet her friends.
But, I didn't think that was fair.
Um, my mum was very, very hard working.
But, what used to trouble me is that, my father put her through so much hell and she never left.
She says she stayed because of us.
But I don't think we'd have grown up the way we did if she had left with us.
She thought we wouldn't be happy.
But, I feel we'd have been ten times happier if we didn't grow up with my dad.
But I felt he was the wrong person for my mother.
And... To this day I wish they'd broken up, before I was born.
I wouldn't have minded being born in another family.
Or, to my mum in another setting.
I'd probably look different.
Probably be taller.
Uh, that would have made me very happy.
But that was it.
We had to take what god gave us.
So there we were together.
And, um, it was a very hard life.
Um, my father wanted the best for us.
But, if he'd_ I felt he didn't know how to love us.
He put us in a good school.
A fee_ we had to pay school fees.
But he didn't want to pay the fees.
So while the other children were in the class learning.
We used to be sitting in the school hall on punishment, because our parents hadn't paid the fees.
And I found that very humiliating.
But I lived with it.
And, um, we used to, get, um, all, all the lunch that we used to get after we left my stepmother_ my mum had to pay for our lunch.
She had to clothe us.
She fed us at home, and my father didn't used to chip in.
They only thing he was expected to do was, keep the roof over our heads.
And the house was his anyway, we weren't paying any rent, and to pay our fees.
Which he didn't do.
But instead he used to give the money to his girlfriends, and pay their school fees.
And pay their rent where they lived.
So we remained poor as it was.
And, he could never stick to one wife.
When he met somebody new he always married her.
He didn't just go out with her.
He always married her and brought her home as another wife.
And he didn't build her a new house either.
So we lived in a traditional African setting, in a modern house.
Which is a very big clash.
Because we had several women living under the same roof, each with their own children.
There was a lot of rivalry between the wives and ones with children.
Which made life very difficult"
"The confounding but also advantageous, um, um... Characteristic of American, uh, higher education... Is that, uh, contrary to what_ to higher education in, in, in many other countries.
Um, higher education in America is very, is very diverse.
And that is a function not only of the range of, disciplines and the range of programs and courses, of study, um, that you can pursue.
But also the fact that, uh, America's a very diverse country.
And, um, it pays to look into, um, it pays first to, to think about what exactly you want to get out of your experience in the United States, as a student um, before you come here, because, um, depending on where you end up there is, um, many things you could accomplish beyond, uh, simply your, your, uh, course of study.
And depending on where you, you, you live, uh, i mean you might, uh, end up living in a very suburban, um, uh, quiet secluded, peaceful, environment you might end up in a, in a very bustling, um, uh, rushed, uh, situation.
Um, and so th- the range of activities, uh, uh, things that are open to you are unimaginable.
Um, um, because as i said before, um, we are, you know, w- we're talking about a, a huge country with, uh, so many differences.
Um... There is of course, you know, when you're coming, when you're coming to, uh, study in the United States you are, um,_ you're trying to to focus on your course of study and, and do the best you can.
But how you do, uh, depends a lot on your social environment and that's something that, cannot be, uh, cannot be ignored.
And, um, it, it, it will affect_ it will impact, um, your, um, your performance greatly.
Um, uh, talking with many foreign students, i realize that, uh, some of them, most of them, uh, as a matter of fact, uh, chose, um, their, their university, uh, simply based on, on academics.
On, uh, on sort of, uh, things like reputation.
And, uh, and, um, faculty members and, and programs and courses of study.
And once they arrived they_ many of them became very disenchanted, socially, you know.
It must be very hard, especially in an elite institution like, like Princeton University.
It must be very hard, for many, um, foreign students.
Um.
But it's, it is one_ it's a very common mistake, one, uh, thing that they neglected.
Uh, which is the_ their social life.
And its something that takes, definitely takes a toll, uh, on them.
And, um, there is many, uh, there is many, many differences, uh, for example between undergraduate and graduate education.
Um, in some cases, um, you know, the undergraduate population is very homogeneous.
But the graduate population is very diverse.
Um, in the case of an elite institution like Princeton, uh, University, um, there is_ the population of foreign students is,  is, is, is.
Uh, is very big.
Um, in other universities it is not so much.
So there is many things to take into consideration, when, when deciding, um, where to go in, in the United States."
"Okay, my name is Chris Morgan, although my friends tend to call me 'Mog'.
I live in Oxford and I work as a publisher.
Usually when I say that a lot of people don’t actually know what a publisher is.
A publisher is someone who takes, someone’s idea basically, maybe a, idea for a story or, a ,a topic, and turns it into a book.
And edits it a_ and, and, and the books see on your shelves that’s, that’s my work really.
So i’m kind of like, a manufacturer, I suppose, of pieces of knowledge.
So that’s what I do.
I’ve always like books and i’m, uh, always been interested in reading and writing.
And always wanted to be a writer myself.
And it just seemed the easiest way to, make your way in the world as a writer was actually to, publish your own_ well publish books to work in the industry.
And then you know, get my stuff out.
And so, i’m kind of doing what i’ve always wanted to do really.
Which is, sort of be involved in the wor_ uh, world of books.
I don’t like all books.
I like kind of books that are a bit unusual or, or a bit weird in, in some ways.
And some of the titles, that we’ve, done_ cause i’ve got a partner as well I should say in, in the company.
Um, i’ll properly give you an idea how strange_ we’ve done books on Jack the Ripper.
We’ve done books on, surrealism and, and art and stuff like that.
So we, we’re interested in art but it would be the, kind of stranger sides or art.
We’ve done books on, Indian religion and,uh, sort of stranger sides of, of India and, and the eastern ideas.
And we’ve done books about, kind of pagan ideas and esoteric ideas and strange things that might be, you might find in, in Britain if you, if you know where, haha, where to look.
So , that gives you an idea wha- of what we do.
Um, and we sell our books all over the world in fact.
So the company’s called Mandrake.
Which to me is such a_ so sort of familiar that eh I kind of, can’t believe that people don’t know what a mandrake is.
But, uh, I meet people all the time , haha, who have never_ who have no idea what a what a mandrake is.
A mandrake is actually, a little plant, uh, like a kind of carroty type thing.
Um, that has all sorts of folklore.
Around the world I mean I think they’re probably different names for it in in kind of what part of the world you’re from.
Mandrake itself isn’t an English word I don’t think.
I think it’s_ nobody knows quite where they got that word from.
Although people think it looks like a little man or something like that.
They say people take the, the mandrake here they’re supposed to have a sort of mystical visions and stuff.
So it’s just seemed an appropriate kind of name for a, publishing company.
So that’s what I do.
I’m,i’m also interested, you know, when i’m not working, I spend my time sort of walking around and, looking at nature and taking photographs.
Maybe studying interesting things like, uh, Egyptology or, the past or, folklore.
Or maybe just sitting in the woods playing me drum.
That’s me."
"On principle I ought to prefer pop music to classical music.
And I did for years.
And I did because classical music was, the conservative music.
The music of the affluent classes.
Pop music is the music of the working people, and the music of rebellion.
And also because, there is always a snobbery about classical music.
A looking down on pop music.
And it was always_ part of me thought it was slightly unfair.
Because what they would do is look at whoever was in the charts and say how terrible they were, and how trivial it was.
And how, it couldn’t stand up to Mozart.
And it_ one could respond at the time that, when Mozart was writing there must have been hundreds and thousands of composers who were trivial and useless.
And, only interested in how much money they could make in a short period of time.
And that compared to Mozart they were no good.
But the difference is that Mozart has survived two hundred years cause he was good.
And the music that’s good today, the pop music, will survive 200 years.
And that’s true.
And yet as time went on I found myself more and more disillusioned with pop music.
And what it was, was that I hated the fact that everybody in the whole pop music business.
And not just the promoters.
Not just the musicians.
But the people who work behind the bars.
The people who write about it.
The people who go and watch it.
The people who talk about it.
Seem to be interested only in proving how cool they were.
The hangers on.
The people who only wanted to... Be bought another drink by someone else they were hanging on to.
The journalists.
Half of them not only couldn’t write a decent sentence.
But had no interest in writing it.
Because they wanted to prove how clever they were.
Or how blasé and how important.
And the friends who, picked up a band one moment, put 'em down the next.
Who, wanted to always be ahead of the game.
Who would always cite some band you’d never heard of.
And then, by the time you’d heard of them would say they were yesterday’s thing.
And move on to someone else.
And the whole thing seemed, trivial.
And the whole thing seemed, to have very little substance.
And, i’d hate the threatening atmosphere you’d get.
You’d walk in to some... Some gig or other.
And there would be the guy at the door who looked at you as if it was a privilege to let you in.
And, I don’t mean it was their privilege, I mean it was your privilege to be allowed in.
Because they were so cool.
They didn’t want to share the same air as you unless they had to.
And the bar staff would look at you in much the same way.
And you’d feel that, you know, you really ought to be, taking money off of them rather than being giving it to you.
And it would be threatening and the bouncers would, drag people out.
And you’d feel the air of a fight all around you.
And I started to say, 'i don’t want this anymore.
' And i started listening to Mozart.
I started listening to Bach.
And it’s certainly true that if you go and watch classical music.
You go to the opera, in Oxford.
And it’s as conservative and unchallenging an audience.
And it’s, complacent as audience as you can ever, wish to find.
And that puts you off a bit.
And it’s, you know it makes you wish for the rebellion and the, the fights that’s in some pop music.
And it’s also true that_ so every so often someone crops up in popular music that you think, has got something interesting to say.
Both musically and lyrically.
And when Jarvis Cocker popped up and Polk started making interesting records.
And I thought, 'thank God there’s still life left in pop music.
' And there’s still people who want, to do what’s interesting rather than what’s blasé and trivial.
And I like that.
But then again I don’t have very much money.
And I have to make decisions.
And I have to ask myself, 'do I want to buy a C-D and give it a chance and see if it’s any good.
Or do I want to buy another concerto by Mozart.
' And on the whole, when you haven’t got as much money, and you have to make choices.
And you have to decide, is Mozart better than Polk then you’re gonna go for Mozart.
And I can afford one C-D every three months and it’s always going to be another concerto by Mozart.
Ask me in ten years time.
And in a way i hope i’ll have changed my mind.
'Cause I don’t want to turn into someone who is, boring and tedious, conservative.
And telling how things were always better two hundred years ago.
But it’s just possible that my music might have been better when Mozart was writing it.
Than when it was appearing on top of the pops."
"There're quite a few differences between... Secondary school in the U-S and the British system.
One thing, a person would notice right away if they went into a school is that in U-S high schools, the students can wear anything, but in the British schools, they wear uniforMs  in terms of the curriculum... In the British system, it's a national curriculum.
All the schools teach the same thing.
And they are all heading for G-C-S-E, exams when the student is about sixteen-years-old.
Or a few years ago it used be the G-C-E exams, or the famous O levels.
Americans don't have any exams similar to that.
Eventually they take the S-A-T which is a multiple choice test.
But the... The G-C-E or O level exams are completely different.
Those are all essay questions and some, short answer questions.
And each exam takes... Three hours or so and you have, sometimes, several exams for each subject.
Another big difference between the American and the British system is that... After about age sixteen... The students in the British system start their A level course.
This is a two-year course and, a student would take, three or at the very most four courses, only.
So they're, really starting to specialize by that time.
Whereas in the U-S system... The students continue to take, a larger variety of courses, math, languages, history.
Uh, but they take fewer hours of that course, since they're taking perhaps eight courses... As compared with only three courses.
So by the time a student in the British system takes his A levels, he is actually quite good in the three courses he's taken.
In terms of getting into university, in U-S system, one needs a good grade-point average and, a good S-A-T score and of course some extracurricular activities and recommendations and things like that.
Once they get into university... They don't necessarily declare what major they want to be until the end of their sophomore year.
And regardless of what major they have, they still have to take a variety of courses.
In the British system, a person, declares their major even when they're applying.
And, from the time they enter university, their courses are very very much geared to that major.
Because they've gotten, a head-start so to speak from, the specialized A level courses, quite often they can get a bachelor's degree, in three years, as compared with four years in the U-S system.
Basically... I think the U-K system is quite good, for students who know what they want to do from a young age, and who have, obvious strengths in certain areas.
The U-S system might be a little better for some students who, really don't know what they want to do."
"Well th- the music i listen to at the moment, i think, is, is based on the sort of a traditional band set up.
I - it's very based in guitars an- and keyboard samples, type sounds.
Um, i suppose a couple of bands to mention would be stuff like, uh, 'Spiritualized', or, or 'Radiohead', who come from the same town, of Oxford.
Where i've been - where i've been studying.
So, they're quite popular here.
Um, the other main, sort of body of music at the moment.
If you could say that there is two.
Would be, uh, dance-based music.
Which- which is music, related t_ uh, t- t- to music played in clubs.
And i- in pubs et cetera to be danced to.
And i'm not really a b- big fan of, of, of club culture.
So i suppose that that alienates me a bit more from that sort of music.
'Cos i, i don't think it's the sort of music that you would really sort of sit at home a- and listen to.
An- and enjoy stuff too.
It, it's more_ it's more memories o- of being out and dancing around.
So_ but it you are not into it, it is not really your sort of thing.
So i, i, i suppose i- it is difficult to say i- if one is superior over the other, other.
I think they're both linked to a_ to a_ to a broader context of what you do in your life.
Um, so maybe you could say that if i, i don't like dance music as a broad category.
And i'm so m- m- boring, he stays at home all the time.
But, um, but then i- i- in between that there's other, there's other faces.
You can't really define as much.
Uh, R and B has been popular, in Britain.
It's, it's huge in America apparently.
And it's, it's probably going to become that way over here.
And, R- R and B's okay.
Although, uh, it annoys me because, uh, i- i- it's supposed to stand for rhythm and blues.
Um, and most the time it doesn't, it doesn't really appear to have either.
I- it's, it's very sort of rambling, warbly type music.
And it's all, very much on the same subjects.
And, following the same form.
And, sort of_ it, it, its by the same people.
And a lot of them are a- all by the same sorts of groups.
So i think what my, oth- th- the_ my, my preference for, for guitar base o- or any sort of live, real live music.
Is that it, it really brings out the individual more.
Whereas i, i, i think sort of mechanized technology-based dance music.
Has a problem, in that it could be anyone, you know, messing around on a computer.
Whereas i think something which is really played live is a more, is a more of a connection between people, and maybe you could say that's superior."
"Yeah, I am a... I'm a strong believer of democracy to a very large extent.
Although sometimes I think, the, the concept is over hyped.
And, uh, I mean, if you look, back to the societies where, uh, democracy thrives.
Um, you, you find unified societies.
Societies with, um, little or no, ethnic differences.
No language differences and things like that.
We find out that when attempts are made to practice democracy in, societies where you have multiple languages and multiple, ethnicity's, um, you are open to all sorts of probleMs  and, um, i, I used to be really mad with President Moi of, of Kenya when he hung onto power for, over three decades.
And, um, tend to give deaf ears to, the west’s calls for him to go democratic.
But it_ but his argument was that, uh, in the situation in which he found himself, and that is in Kenya, where by my estimation, you had over forty-three tribal groups and the, majority of them, very, very conscious of their tribal id_ identities, and not willing to, to, I mean, to interact freely with other me_ tribe members.
And, they had a real problem intermarrying in Kenya.
And so Moi was saying this is a big problem.
When it would come to introduce democracy, because then people would be divided, along tribal lines.
And, uh, after much, you know, retrospect, I tend to agree with him to a large extent.
That while, uh, Africans have not, found out, you know, the real system of governance for multi ethnic societies.
Democracy as seen by the west, is really not, you know, the one size fits all solution for, for African countries.
Lt and, um, a lot of modification needs to be done, for it to be really successful.
Because, um, even in the countries that democracy seems to be working,and people are not as tribalistic as_ have been.
You find out always when it comes to election times, people will try to, you know, whip up the tribal sentiments.
Even though, after the elections they try to, to let people forget about their differences, and try to unify them once more.
But it is always happens, that is come election times, tribal sentiments are whipped up, and people get slightly divided along tribal lines.
And, uh, it is just by sheer luck in a lot of instances that, things do not crumble at that point.
So that is my opinion about, uh, the west prescribing democracy for Africa."
"On one of my trips, uh, in Cambodia I went up to a, a village called Sambor.
It’s about two-thirds of the way up the Mekong to the Lao border.
It’s_ the nearest big town’s Crache, which is an absolutely gorgeous old French colonial town.
It’s a beautiful place.
And nobody seems to live there.
And the_ Sambor is supposed to be the nearest place to the, uh, to the site of an old sixth century capital of, uh, the empire called Funan.
Which was mentioned in, uh, some Chinese reports.
And, um, I went up there to try and see if there was any evidence there of this old, uh, empire and the city.
But there wasn’t it had all been eaten up by the jungle.
But on the way there, we stopped for, breakfast at a little_ uh, this little roadside café place which does, good coffee which is a legacy of the French colonialism.
Which isn’t so bad at all.
And then we_ and while I was having my breakie there, somebody mentioned that there were dolphins in the area.
In the Mekong.
So I managed to hire a boat to, to go out into the river with a little boy punting it.
And, we went into, kind of a little, a little glade it would be in a river.
There_ outside of the main currents.
And the water was really still.
Perfectly still.
And then, just all around the boat, you could see, where ripples_ and if you were looking in the right place at the right time you’d be able to see it’s back, and it’s little stubby fin breaking the surface of the water.
But, it was very difficult to see that.
And you couldn’t hear.
You couldn’t listen for the ripples and then turn around.
But, what blew me away was the sound they made.
We couldn’t_ as I said it was difficult to see the dolphins.
But when they came to the surface and they breathed through their blowholes, there’d be this little puffing noises, all around the boat.
Which was, really wonderful.
And we spent, we spent a good part of the morning just floating on the Mekong and listening to the dolphins."
"I recently read, uh, Dostoevski's, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>.
And I found it to be a very interesting_ reading.
Um, one or two things, about the book, um, first is that I like the unique... Style of detection that's embedded in the, whole story.
The way, the way the police officer gets Raskolnikov, the main character in the story, to confess in the end.
This kind of detection, essentially psychological, is very different from, the Sherlock Holmes kind of thing where you go with lens, looking around for dust and foot prints.
It's interesting to read that style of detection.
And the other aspect of the book, of course, which is the main theme of the book, is_ um, that_ what happens to a person who chooses to... Commit a crime for the greater good.
Is it okay to, uh, basically kill somebody if you know that this person is, uh, useless for the society and, by killing him you get a lot of people to live a better life.
Uh, is it good for an individual to take upon in his hands to, you know,rea- really behave like God.
So, Dostoevski, of course, gives a clear verdict that, you shouldn't do it, you'll mess up your life, if you do that.
It's interesting to see that, he thought of this and put it in a story like form, for everyone to, read it.
The other aspect of the book, of course, is his, uh,writing style... That he brings out lot of what goes on in Raskolnikov's mind, on papers.
This is a very rare thing to_ that... A writer can write so much about, eh, what goes on in someone's head, without much happening on the external world.
And of course the story has a lot of interesting characters, well developed characterizations.
Uh, Raskolnikov, his friend, his brother.
And it's a very interesting book for, people to read and enjoy."
"About 1500 miles, off the coast of America, lying in the Pacific, is an island which we call Easter Island.
It's renowned around the world, for the huge figures, carved out of stone.
Lay- laying across the coast, facing out to sea.
Like giant warriors they try to fend off, any outsiders from la- landing on the island.
When, Westerners originally landed on this island.
They found, a few poor people, warring with each other.
Poverty stricken, in a terrible state.
The end of the population.
In the beginning of the island's history, there was a strong community, and a strong population of people.
Working together, with plenty to eat and plenty to do.
But unfortunately, they led to their own destruction.
They lived on animals such as pigs and chickens.
And they sewed their own grain, which they harvested.
And they lived on, um, tubers such as, sweet potatoes and that sort of thing.
As they had so much food, they had plenty of time, to do other things.
They weren't constantly having to search for food.
So, the clans of people, fought for supremacy in the island.
And a way of showing, their supremacy, was to show that they had so much food, they could spare this many people to carve a huge figure.
So the stone was hewn out of the rock of the island.
The figures were carved, and they were put in the most prominent places on the island.
So that all the other people could see how clever that clan was.
How strong they were.
But in order to move, the figures, to the coast, they had to chop down trees.
And they chopped down the trees and they used, tree trunks as rollers.
And they rolled these statues.
As each clan got one extra statue, the other clans thought we must get another statue as well.
So, they, built and they built.
And they chopped more and more trees down.
And they moved them all to the coast.
The trees never had a chance to regenerate.
Because they were chopped down too quickly, in too small an area.
Once the trees had gone there were no, root systems to hold the soil in together.
And soil erosion took place.
Nutrients were leached out of the soils.
And they soon found, in the space of a few hundred years.
That, they could no longer grow food of a good nutritional quality.
People became... Starving.
They, couldn't search through the forests for food, because they'd already chopped them down.
The animals, didn't have enough food.
So it was difficult to live off the meat as well.
And this is the state that the people found them in when they first landed on Easter Island.
So... The poignant lesson, on how we should look after what we've got.
And, not try to,  fight for supremacy between ourselves.
Um, the, ecosystem in which they lived, was fine before they... Tried to get above themselves.
Just living at harmony, with one with the ecosystem, everything would have been all right.
And the island would still be a perfect Pacific paradise now."
"My love life, my love life started when I was born.
Because i'm a very_ i'm full of so much love.
And I exuded that, and that's why I think I was attracted to_ I mean I was, a- attractive to many people.
I was just... You know people just love me.
And I love people.
I love people to this day.
Which is i, I think is one of my downfalls, or one of my weaknesses or something, I don't know.
But, um... I... I have been hurt a lot too.
And that has allowed me to grow and learn more about how, to love myself, actually and to_ how to love other people.
Because the way I did it, I just gave and gave and gave love.
And, you know unconditional.
People could do so much to me before I would stop, you know, stop loving them or re- or respecting them or liking them, even.
Um... I'm a very sensual person, i'm not, affectionate.
Well affectionate too.
But ver- I love touching, and just,  just making someone feel good about themselves, giving, giving people hugs, I love that too.
Um, now the the official love life, I started, I started_ I first  fell in love when I was thirteen years old.
It was my eighth grade year, I had just moved to Montclair, actually my seventh grade year, and that was a... Big story.
I loved it, I enjoyed that part of my life, even though it was difficult for me, I enjoyed it.
Um, his name was Evan, and he had a big head.
And he was tall and slinky which I loved, tall slinky men.
And, um, he was in my social studies class and I just stared at him all the time.
And he was so cute.
And this song by S-W-V was out, and I always sang it and thought about him.
And, one day I had a party, and I invited him and his friends' would've liked that.
So he'd come cuz,his if,if his friends' were coming, he would come.
And it turned out really well, because like... He came over, we danced all night and it was just wonderful.
And, that turned into a three year type attachment thing, like_ I i think it was love because I i sort of know what it feels like.
But,maybe someone else would say it wasn't.
Um, I was attached to him also like I could not_ he would come over i'd let him in my house around twelve in the morning when he came over when he was- wants to be over.
He knocked on my window and I go to the door and open it for him, and then, we'd just hang out in the living room, because the living room was far away from my momma's room.
So, it was, it was possible, you know.
Um, now the third_ the second year of this... Long term thing, love aff-  love thing.
Um, he was still coming over at twelve in the morning one o'clock in the morning whenever he wanted to.
And my mother decided, once in two years to come to living room at this time.
And she came in the living room and, my life was over.
Oh my life was over.
I was on punishment for the next_  the rest of the summer and the next summer after that, for about a month.
Um, she really punished me because she took away my, she took away my music and my T-V.
And, I had nothing.
Music was my, you know, one of my big big things, my big, releases.
And she took that away.
And... I'm going off my, love life but... It was a bad punishment.
And I learned a lot from that, two year ordeal.
And that started off my... Trend of finding a guy, and going to crap.
And then... Um learning from it somehow.
Until I found my first true true true love.
And it's wonderful.
And that's too long a story so I won't go into that."
"Many people, in the west right now are quite surprised with the situation that is, present in countries of former Soviet Union.
In fact will like to talk about some economical problems that we have present.
The very, very interesting point about that is that the majority of the population of the former Soviet Union is sure, that the major cause of that economical crisis is that_ reforms that were introduced by Gorbachev in the eighties.
And they think that, those reforms in fact, led to the problems with economics and didn't change anything in political sense, which led naturally to, the situation when people simply blame Gorbachev, for all those reforMs  and they don't quite appreciate the whole importance of that, point in the history.
And probably it's possible to describe how, the soviet system could come to this end.
Which in fact_ have taken place in nineteen-ninety-one when the Soviet Union simply fell apart.
We probably should know that the Soviet system in the seventies when, Brezhnev was in power was mainly based on the raw materials and natural resources, which were simply sold to the west.
And this money_ this income was covering all the immediate expenses.
For example, raw materials were present in really high supply.
There were really high supplies of raw materials in the Soviet us- Union.
For example, oil, natural gas, wood and so on.
And basically.
Whole economy was based on that kind of supply.
Another problem with the soviet system was that, any average person was not quite interested in his or her own work, because the system was the following.
You work, and you get exactly the same amount of money as your neighbor does.
That means that, if you go to the work and come there at eight o'clock and leave at five o'clock, you get exactly the same amount of money, as your neighbor if he doesn't work, or if he does work.
So that means that productivity of any kind of, work was pretty low.
And that means that, no improvement was made to equipment.
And, no inventions were, were achieved or something like that.
So the situation was, like_ the situation looks like_ looked like this, in the beginning of eighties.
And when the crises between Iraq and Iran took place in late seventies, world prices for oil and natural gas went down.
And it automatically meant that the Soviet Union was not getting enough money, to cover all immediate living expenses.
And it meant that the system was not able to support itself, with that kind o...F productivity and that kind of equipment and the sy- and the arrangement that they had at that time.
And automatically, any immediate changes, any reforms could simply make it, happen sooner.
What exactly_ what happened when Gorbachev came to power.
He initiated those reforms that, it was very good point from his_ were_ it was very good decision that he had he had made.
It was very, important point in the history of our people.
But the problem was that, we had a coincidence of that coming crisis and economical and political reforms that Gorbachev had initiated.
And, this coincidence lead to, the widespread belief that our people have that Gorbachev was the main cause for those economical problems that we have now and we have to deal with.
But definitely it's not the true.
It could make, those problems come sooner.
But it could_ but the absence of those reforms could not prevent it from coming."
"Well, i’m working at a company, at, uh, New Jersey.
And I learned... I’m missing something.
In order to relate with, er, other people.
And, uh, in order to, uh, communicate with, uh, uh, people in other areas.
Like operational area, or, uh, other entirely different from research.
So, one day, when I was reading a magazine, I found a very interesting, article about emotional intelligence.
And i’m going to talk about what it is.
The article claims, uh, ah, maybe, name, I think I should say name.
Uh, the author’s name is Goldman, something like that.
I am sorry, I did not register name right.
And he claims, er, uh, seventy-five percent of our effectiv- effectiveness in living, comes from emotional intelligence.
And only twent-five percent, comes from, uh, intelligent_ regular intelligent, uh, cognitive quotient I-Q.
And, uh, he claims, uh, emotional intelligence, uh, uh, consists of three, eh, three things.
First one is deal with people... And how well, you can deal with people.
And the second one is, uh, how well you can manage relationships.
And, how well you can manage, uh, your emotions.
And, uh, you have a fine sense of, uh, how other people feel.
Third one is, uh, understand ourselves.
And he, conducted a study about, emotional intelligence for a hundred-twenty-one companies.
And, uh, he concluded that, uh, um, emotional intelligence  is, uh, more, uh, contributed to bring success, uh, in people’s performance in a company.
Indeed, as, uh, twice as, uh, more important, as I-Q and technical knowledge.
And, uh, if_ when people get in higher and higher, uh, top level positions, then those people’s emotional intelligence, are usually, better and better.
That’s what, uh, his findings are.
Well, and, uh, he further, uh, talked about there are five components, to have high emotional intelligence.
The first one is self-awareness.
And this relates with how well good decision, uh, you can make.
Or, how high self-esteem you can have.
And, uh, also, you know, connecting to_ having good intuition or, gut feeling when they decide something, something, you know, at company.
And the second one is self- self-regulation.
That means to handle and manage our emotions well.
And, uh, even though, uh, you are in very emotional situations, you can still stay calm, and control your emotions.
And third one is motivation.
You have to have motivation.
Of course, and, uh, that’s, uh, that’s common sense.
And fourth one is, uh, you have to have empathy.
Of course that is also common sense I understand.
And, uh, last one is, uh, social skills.
Social skills are, defined by handling relationships, adeptly and, uh,induce desirable responses in others.
That’s, that’s what, uh, the author defined.
And, uh, he talks about more, you know, how to, uh, how to, you know, polish these, uh, five skills.
And difference is, emotional intelligence can learn, and you can have high emotional intelligence, after you practice to, uh, yourself to get those skills.
But I-Q is sometimes impossible, hehe, to get high I-Qs, no matter how, you know, you work hard.
And that’s the differences.
And, well, and, uh, yeah, that was_ mostly, uh, makes sense.
And I agree with the author.
But, uh, it seems to me, he’s lacking most important, uh, thing there.
Everybody had to have, the principle to believe, and, uh, as you know, a, anchor or a standard of_ or, a set of values.
That is my opinion."
"The world that we live in, is the only world that we've got to live in.
The environment which we live in is one which we make for ourselves.
And the more we try, the better world we'll live in.
It's all very well, thinking everything's okay at the moment.
But, we need to work and we need to think about what's coming ahead.
The generations to come we're t_ we're quickly running out fuels such as gas and oil and coal.
We don't know how long they'll last for.
But we do know that they are finite.
So they will run out sooner or later.
With things like that on the horizon.
We need to be looking for more sustainable, sources of energy.
Just, simply chopping down trees to burn wood, has such a vast number of consequences that, that need to be looked at very carefully before we can decide just how much we are able to get away with.
When trees are cut down by villagers in poorer countries.
They have no alternatives.
They need to eat.
Therefore they need to cook their food.
They need to keep warm.
And, wood is probably the only natural resource they have nearby which they can rely on.
By chopping this down though they, expose the soil to the wind and the rain.
And so it can get blown away and washed away.
All the minerals which the trees were holding in, get leached out.
And, all of a sudden the villagers find that they, have no fertile soil left on which to grow their crops.
We need to teach people more about, the fragility of the earth.
We need to work harder, to keep what we've already got.
Whether we're talking about aluminium or tin, or glass, or plastic.
We should recycle wherever we can.
People say it costs just as much in energy to recycle as it does to make for new.
But the point is, not the energy that's going into it.
But the materials that are going into it.
And any element, such as, aluminium or tin will run out sooner or later.
It will be a lot more energy required to scavenge these things out of old rubbish tips in the years to come.
Than if we actually try and make an effort to recycle everything now.
I think for the sake of all future generations we should do what we can.
And just put a little bit of extra time into our days to think about things such as that."
"In the last few days we had, uh, an elections to the European Parliament in this country.
And they counted up the votes last night.
And the Conservatives did better than Labour.
And the U-K Independence Party didn't do too badly at all.
But what has surprised me, is, is the way that politicians have reacted to a very, very low turnout, in the elections in this country.
Is that they themselves seem quite surprised and upset, by the result.
Bu- but i don't really think anybody should be surprised at all by that.
Because, um, i don't think anyone in this country really knows what they're voting for.
Uh, i, i think we've been very very badly informed on the whole issue of Europe.
So it's no surprise that the only people turning up to vote, are those that are anti-Europe.
Because it's, it's a form of fear, mixed with ignorance about Europe.
So, i think if the politicians are really as, as keen as they appear in their rhetoric about Europe.
It'd be much more helpful, if they'd actually tell us what we can expect in the next few years from Europe.
Considering that we, when we have a general election in this country.
So much care is taken to outline a manifesto and be de_ and be detailed about what they can achieve.
Everyone knows that education and health would be important factors to make people feel secure about, in terms of your party.
Yet as a voter i'd have had absolutely no idea, what anybody was going to do for me in Europe at all.
So, i think if Europe's got a future, th- then people have to be informed, about what that future's supposed to be, before they're expected to vote for it. 			"
"I think, i think Feminism is a very tricky subject.
I listened to the radio this morning, and, um, i cannot remember her name.
But ther- it was a lady in America that ran for vice president, um, in 1984.
And sh- sh- she was defending the fe- the feminist cause et cetera.
Um, but i, i, i wasn't really very convinced by, by what she said.
Because i think that people of my generation who were born at least into some semblance of, of, of equality that pe- pe- people have what appear to be a real chip on her shoulder about, a- about about that sort of thing.
Was a wa- wa- was a bit difficult to get hold of and i think feminists probably wh- who, uh, who could possibly have a problem in store if they say, i- if they go too far in a certain direction and they can have almost some sort of backlash, against feminism, because they're mo_ almost m- m- making a point that s- becomes, becomes seen as too trite and too obvious, to people who aren't really used to treating women much different.
I think, because of the bu_ everyone realises certain physiological differences.
But in terms of the way you actually treat someone there aren't_ there shouldn't be at least that many people o- of roughly my age who are really deliberately, consciously that patronising to women, or treating them as second class citizens.
It's not really_ i- i- it's not really a subject tha- that causes much debate.
So the only subject left now is, is achieving equality, in terms of jobs to m- make sure that women have an equal share of certain positions.
Like i think it was only a, a couple of years ago th- th- that Lords' or no, even more recently than that, that Lord's Cricket Ground, um, allowed women into one of their club areas or something.
But i think i- in terms of actual jobs for women to, women to become equal should be_ should allow to be a gradual process.
Because the idea of positive discrimination, it's still discrimination and it just causes more problems than it solves."
" the first time i went to America, was in July nineteen-ninety-seven.
I was sent to America by Citibank, which is an American bank, uh, being_ um, having, uh, an office in, Hanoi in Vietnam.
And, um, i was involved in some, uh, direct investment projects.
So they sent me here to America to learn about how to do research and stuff like that.
Um, you know, like just to have a good time and_ and so, um, it was July and, um, the weather was beautiful both in Vietnam and, and in America.
So, um, i flew from Hanoi to Bangkok, which is the capital city of Thailand.
Then from, Bangkok on to Tokyo, which is in Japan.
And from Tokyo all the way, to San Francisco.
So when i arrived at_ in San Francisco, it had been, say, thirty hours, both in the airplanes and, um, waiting at the airports and stuff like that.
And, um, after i got cleared out with, uh, customs and, immigration formalities and... I decided to just walk out of, the airport and see how it's like.
I was just_ i had read so many books before i went to America for the first time.
I had been speaking American English for almost seven years.
And, um, so i was expecting something like revolutionary, some kind of mental explosion in me.
And that's exactly what happened.
I walked out of the airport, and there was San Francisco, crispy air and floral_ like flower scents.
And all of sudden i felt like i was in love with the place.
And so i went back in and, tried to see whether i could change my departure date.
I was on my way to New York.
And it couldn't happen.
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't stay another day as I wanted, in San Francisco.
But um, that's the very first, uh, impression of America.
Just like beautiful weather.
And so on to New York.
And i arrived, like midnight.
And when i got out of the airport, there was a friend who picked me up.
And we drove in the city.
At first i was kind of disappointed.
And i thought &quot;this is New York.
&Quot; i've read so many books about New York and this is not the metropolitan that, i was, um, anticipating.
But then, um, back in the city we got out of the car, checked in the hotel, and i walked out again in the street.
It was about, one o'clock in the morning.
And that's when in_ the feelings started all over again.
The smell in the air, that was... Not familiar.
But there was a sense of <i>deja vous</i> that this has happened somewhere.
Maybe it all came from the books that i've read about, 'Catcher in the Rye', about the sense of liberty that New York has_ um, hanging in the air.
So, um, it went on like that.
I got back to the hotel, went to sleep.
And the next few days, when you know, in broad day light when i saw New York, you know, the way how like commerce its activities are, and how the people are different and, similar in the same_ at the same time, um, with what i had anticipated about New York, i couldn't think straight.
And there was so much information coming in, uh, at the same time.
And, um, i think that, you know, if you are going to America, you should avoid going to New York as your first destination.
Otherwise you will be so overwhelmed and, impression of America may be kind of falsified in a way. "
"When i first saw England i saw it from, several thousand feet ov_ feet in the air.
And we were circling London.
While waiting for our chance to land at the London Heathrow Airport.
And as i looked down_ as i looked through the window, from the aeroplane.
I was really disappointed.
Because i thought, i thought i'd be met with skyscrapers and, very very modern buildings.
But from, where i was sitting up there in the air, London looked very much like an African village to me.
And, there are so many tiny houses and they all looked alike.
They resembled African huts.
And, i thought i was going to a really modern place, but, it wasn't really far removed from the African village.
Um, later on, on the ground things were different, when i had a good look.
The small buildings weren't all_ they weren't really mud houses.
But they were_ they had brown roofs.
But the houses really were identical.
So, um, it was really impressive because the roads_ everything was all nice and neat.
And, the only difference was it was really, really cold here, as compared to where i was from.
I was wearing a very light skirt suit and i thought it was going to be blazing hot.
But it was just at the end of winter.
And that was something very new to me.
So, um... First of all i was really shocked by the way the people were talking.
Right up 'til then i thought i knew English.
And then i realised i didn't speak English at all.
I mean, compared to the way they were speaking it.
Um, i realised right then that i had an accent, which i hadn't known before.
And, it hit me suddenly that i was a foreigner now.
Not somebody else in my country.
And i felt, lost.
Everything was really different.
Um, when i left the airport, i boarded a bus for Oxford.
And, the buses were heated, which was new.
The buses where i come from are not heated.
And, they were very neat and clean.
And you pay the driver, instead of having a conductor walking about, taking money from you and giving, you a ticket.
And, as we left Heathrow Airport i was disappointed to note that there was rubbish, on the roadside, just like, in Nairobi, where i'd just come from.
And... There were Coca-Cola cans, and chocolate wrappers.
And i was really shocked, because i thought, there was_ somebody had told me nobo_ there was, there is no dust in England, there is no rubbish anywhere.
So, um, everything else was pretty much the same as in Nairobi.
The buildings were sort of the same, probably, because of the, English influence in Kenya.
They_ the Lon_ the houses turned out to be pretty much the same.
And i fell asleep on my journey to Oxford.
I woke up just after we'd entered Oxford, city centre.
And, we got out of the bus and we made our way to our hotel.
And, it was really, really cold.
And, everybody spoke funny.
I felt, everybody was speaking with a different accent, from what i was used to.
And i was afraid to use the telephone because, i thought they wouldn't understand me.
And, they kept saying sorry when i spoke, 'coz they didn't hear what i said.
And, some people would complain later that i spoke with an American accent.
Which i hadn't realised.
But that was because of the influence of Americans in Kenya.
We watch American T-V all the time.
So, with time i hoped that i'd be able to speak different.
Then after staying in a hotel for a while, we got a rented house which was cheaper.
And we had to share a house with several other people.
My husband and i were sharing with a, a Jamaican man, who was brought up here.
And several English people.
And, uh... The one thing that shocked me was the people live, so, calmly and comfortably with homosexuals.
And there was one in the house and it really made me nervous because, i'd never seen a homosexual before in my life.
And even if i saw one i didn't know that was one.
But, i'd never met one who wasn't ashamed to be one.
And, there were also people occasionally taking drugs in the house.
Marijuana and... I was against drug taking, and, that disturbed me a lot.
Um, generally the people were very nice, very polite.
And, even if they didn't like you they wouldn't tell you.
But, the one thing that i found very, very, um, the_ the one thing that made me very comfortable about being in Oxford, and living with all these people was, the fact that they don't stare.
In Kenya we stare at anything fascinating and it's not rude to stare, in Kenya.
But here it is rude to stare.
So nobody was staring at me because i was different, or dressed different.
And, um, they treated me with dignity which is something very important.
And it helped me to settle in very fast.
And, generally, i was afraid of people.
But, that was soon overcome because i found that people were very hospitable, and very kind and willing to help.
And if you were lost you could ask anybody and they'd help you.
They wouldn't be rude, like we were back home.
And, generally i enjoyed it very much, being in Oxford."
"In this country we say football.
Some countries they say soccer.
We insist on saying football in England.
Um, we insist on it because, it matters to get it right.
And it matters because football matters.
And why football matters is.
. .  A question we very rarely ask ourselves.
Except... Sometimes when it’s been a particularly grim game.
Or we’re standing there and nothing’s gonna happen.
And we're- our team is losing and it’s raining.
And we spend a lot of money on it.
And there’s something on television that we would like to have seen.
And we’re getting older.
And everybody’s getting older and no one’s getting any richer.
And we stand there and we say to each other, 'why do we do this.
' And we don’t have a ready answer to that question.
Why do we do this.
But we have at least asked it.
And though we ask it in a particularly self-deprecating and unserious manner.
Sometimes, when we have a lot of time to spare and, after the game.
And when the evening is stretching out ahead of us.
And we are going to have too much to drink.
If we haven’t had it already.
We ask well 'why do we do this.
'And the only answer i can really come to, is that football means something.
It represents something.
It has a symbolic value.
It’s a melodrama.
It’s not a complicated drama.
It has very little by way of developing it’s characters.
It’s characters are stock characters.
The big rich team.
The small battling local side.
Us.
Them.
Things that we’re familiar with.
Things that don’t have to be explained.
Much in the same way that soap opera characters are very often stereotypes, are not always developed too clearly.
Are always imagined, at least that the start to represent a few simple values.
And this melodrama, interests us because... It reflects things that do, appeal to us in our real lives.
We like to see the big team, beaten by the small team, because, the same reason that we always like to see the underdogs succeed in a film.
You never have a film where, the enormous, powerful big army come and crush a few brave freedom fighters and where you support the army.
Because of course you don’t.
You always have, the few small brave people manage to, by dint of their own, moral rectitude and their own personal brilliance, defeat the larger force.
And so you like to see the underdog win.
And that’s because, you either are used to being the underdog.
You either are used to being the small person with not much money.
Not much power.
Confronting forces bigger than yourself and hostile to yourself.
Or you like to pretend you are.
Even the rich, pretend that they’re the common man.
And so even the rich, can see what the point, of supporting some other team that’s playing Manchester United is.
And because football is such an easily comprehensible melodrama, it translates.
Those quite complicated, feelings of, having to fight against larger forces, into a very simple template.
Manchester United versus Leicester City.
Oxford United versus Chelsea.
Cheltenham Town against Liverpool.
And that is it’s... Main symbolic value.
It is how we identify, with a force that is going to take on, hostile, superior forces.
And very occasionally it’ll win.
The real symbolic value is, usually it doesn’t.
And usually reality asserts itself.
And usually our team doesn’t win.
And usually our team will carry on not winning.
And usually while it carries on not winning, we’ll carry on having our money separated from us.
Carry on having promises made to us.
Carry on, believing all these promises because we have no where else to go.
And symbolically, football will replicate the reality that we’re trying to get away from.
Which is we have no power.
And they know it.
And they like to take advantage of it."
"Sigmund Freud was one of the very important people in the twentieth century.
He,um, couldn't stand living in Germany after the rise of Hitler.
And he was trying to leave.
But, one day_ one night, he was arrested by the Gestapo.
The German secret police.
And, he had to, talk with them all night long.
In the morning they wanted him to sign a release.
Th- the_ the, um, Gestapo wanted him to write something to show that they had not, tortured him or mistreated him.
And so Freud wrote, &quot;I heartily recommend the Gestapo to everyone,&quot; which is very funny, you know, knowing their record.
Anyway he escaped to England.
And then, came to America.
I thought that's a good story. 			"
"I'm involved in a group called the Friends of Tibet.
What this group tries to do is, raise awareness of the situation going on in Tibet.
And we also raise money, to send to, uh, refugee camps and, schools for, refugee children, in Nepal, Ladakh and, uh, in Lhasa.
There's a lot of problems going on over there.
There's, political fighting about the boundaries of the country and who owns it.
But, the most immediate problem, to me is that an entire ancient culture is being destroyed.
It's almost exactly the same as when Europeans came, to North America and wiped out an entire... World of people.
It is the same thing that Tibetans have, a unique culture, a unique religio..., And it's forbidden for them to to live this anymore.
It is forbidden for them to speak in their own language.
They can't wear their traditional clothing.
I know someone who has friends.
She is from Tibet.
Her friends have served six-year, jail sentences for having pictures of the, Dali Llama inside their own homes, because sometimes the Chinese authorities will just knock on peoples' doors randomly and check for things like that.
So we're concerned because the school children are being taught in Chinese.
They don't understand the language.
They're been edged out of jobs.
Tibetan people are forced to retire at about age forty or so.
And the entire country is being demoralized.
The young people now are on the streets of Lhasa, and they don't care about studying, and they are starting to just, drink too much, and just, totally waste themselves.
It is the saddest thing for people to go there_ is to see... That the people seem to have given up their spirit, and that's the most dangerous thing.
So we are trying to raise awareness in the United States.
People say... &Quot;oh it's so trendy and popular.
&Quot; but i don' care what they call it because if people... Learn more about this little country it becomes real to them, and it will become outrageous to them for it to be destroyed.
I think that public opinion can, change political situations.
So that's what we are hoping for.
We invite speakers.
We're actually having_ the Dali Llama's brother is coming in October to speak about Buddhism.
This spring, we had some monks who made a sand mandala.
They did some Buddhist rituals, and we we had these... Eight monks living in our homes for a weekend.
It was very interesting.
And we have_ we show films about the country, and... Hand out literature and information.
And the other thing we do is raise money.
We support an orphanage in, uh, Nepal in a very, poor region of Nepal, that people don't go to a lot.
And there's a school in Ladakh for Tibetan children.
And now we are supporting a project for refugee women, to start their own little businesses.
Um, we're also helping to build a new orphanage outside of Lhasa.
It doesn't take very many American dollars to go very far in Tibet.
So... Hopefully we can have some impact."
"I'm a complete and utter city girl.
And i do know this, because i tried living in the country.
Ha ha.
I, was fed up with my job.
I was fed up with my house.
I was just kind of bored.
And i didn't know what i wanted to do next.
So, i, divided all my possessions into three.
A few of them i took back to my parents house, and they stored them under my old bed.
The rest i either threw away, or sold.
And what_ i was left with a knapsack.
And i put that knapsack on my back, and i went to live in Wales.
Halfway up a mountain.
And it was a complete hippie farm.
It was organic farm.
And we worked barefoot as soon as the snow had gone.
While there was snow, we'd still did shoes.
And, i- it was sort of_ the guy who ran it was... I think, partly trying to teach, and encourage, young people who would come and work on his farm, in in what the lifestyle was about.
So even though, he was a vegetarian.
In fact they were all vegetarians, except me, um, there was a lot of livestock on the farm.
And they were all terribly upset, when, the livestock was collected by the, lorry, to take it to the abattoir.
And also, they killed one of the ducks.
They had to kill one of the ducks, because there were seven ducks.
Six of which were male, and they were all fighting, ha ha, dreadfully.
So, they thought it would be better, if they just took out th- the top guy or something.
I dunno, this was done before i got here.
But there was this duck pr- that i was presented with, when i came back from the field one day.
Still warm, and they asked if i might possibly be able to pluck it, because they were all too upset to pluck it, ha ha.
So, i did and it's a very nice warm job, if you don't mind the blood.
Very nice, warm duck on your lap.
You know, 'cos it, it's only just dead, and it was a freezing day, and we didn't have anything like, proper warm bathrooMs  or proper central heating, or anything like that.
So, i think i did quite well out there, as a hard heart pays, especially in vegetarian hippie land.
There was a lot of other um good things on the farm, apart from the ducks.
There were bees.
He kept his own bees for, um, looking after_ making sure that the crops were properly pollenated.
And, m- we also got honey from them.
And also, um, when we'd finished cleaning out, the old, um, honeycomb slats.
The- they come in little wooden box things, that you pull out.
When we'd finished cleaning out one of those, we had a_ quite a lot of spare bees wax.
Um, i think the guy who ran it, may have wanted us to make candles out of it.
But, the hippies got to it first.
And decided it would be the perfect thing to seal their dreadlocks with, to make them waterproof.
Um, this is, apparently, the done thing to do.
So, we were melting up lots and lots of bees wax.
Still quite sticky, and sweet with honey, and smearing it_ sort of buttering it onto the_ onto each individual dreadlock, with a butter knife.
Up and down, so that their, their, their dreads were nice, and you know, properly turned out dreads.
Um, and then, when this little interlude was over, we went back outside, to carry on working in the fields.
And the bees were very impressed by the smell of honey, ha ha, in their hair.
And, uh, the guy who, who had most of it done, was absolutely pursued by bees for the rest of the afternoon.
He was terribly upset.
Because, once you've sealed your dreadlocks with wax, it's_ you mustn't get them wet, because the water will run down inside the dread lock, and stay there.
It doesn't dry properly, like, normal hair.
Um, and you get a terrible condition, called dread rot.
Ha ha, which is where the dreadlocks start to decompose inside, because they're damp, and the dampness can't escape, and it really smells.
Because, hairs got sulphur in it.
Most unpleasant.
And there was_ there was great fear that he might end up with dread rot.
I left before we could be sure which way it turned out.
Haha.
Um, happy memories.
There were a lot of very unusual animals on the farm.
Not just the people.
Um, there were_ he, he specialised, in old-fashioned breeds of things.
So, there were Jacob Sheep, which are, quite, goat-like sheep actually.
There were also goats.
We'll come to them in a minute.
The_ the sheep were, shorter, and more mean-looking than than most sheep.
With big horns, that he wouldn't take off because they were the sheep's right to have those horns.
And, they had these la- little black lambs, and a couple of them, they were_ th_ the main she_ ewes were, were very old.
And consequently a few of the little lambs weren't properly looked after.
I think one of the ewes had died.
Um, and some of them had had triplets, and were just far too old to be able to, to cope with having triplets to feed.
So we'd have to feed them with, with bottles.
We used Newcastle Brown Ale bottles, ha ha, with the mix in.
And, all the sheep_ but all the little lambs, but one, were really keen on this.
And they would come flying at you across the field when you arrived with your, your little bottle of milk, with the teat on the top.
They knew what it was, and they liked it.
And they were very strong, and very fast-moving, and solid.
And with a lower centre of gravity.
So, as they flew at you, you had to get down, or they could knock you over.
The way you feed a baby lamb, with milk, is you have to be behind it.
Because lambs push_ pull backwards from the teat.
Um, to make the milk come.
So, when they're drinking from a bottle they will pull away from it.
So you hold the bottle in front of you, and the lamb pushes back against your stomach.
Um, so it's a very strange experience.
And, as they got stronger and bigger, and developed sharper teeth, they did occasionally draw blood, if you weren't careful in the way you held the bottle.
I'm so glad i'm not a sheep.
Um, one of the lambs, really didn't like, bottled milk.
I'm not quite sure.
I feel that this lamb may have suffered some psychological trauma.
Because... He, just ran, from food.
All the way round, you had to chase him with the shepherds crook, and and the sheep dog.
And it was always two or three people_ were necessary to get him, to have his milk.
It was psychological eating disorder, i think.
Anorexic lamb.
But he went off with the rest of them the right weight at the end of the summer.
So, that's the important thing.
And i'm sure he was very tasty.
Um, oh yes, we had goats.
Ha ha.
The goats were very nice.
I lived above the goats.
The goats lived in the bottom half of the hay loft.
And, i actually had my bedroll on, on the wooden floor just above them.
And... You could sort of hear them muttering, and stamping, and farting quite a lot.
It was the kind of noise, that... I got very used to, until my lovely city boyfriend came to stay with me for the weekend, to see what it was like on the farm.
And... The cows trod on his feet, when he went to feed them.
And the sheep terrorised him.
But, trying to comfort him, and show him how wonderful everything is, and i promise i'll come back to the city soon, with farting goats underneath us, quite ha ha, hard work really.
Ha ha.
It takes an awful of, atmosphere to overcome, that, that sort of environment, really.
But it was beautiful, and it was, unbelievably romantic_ foo_ as it_ as, uh, in the other meaning of romantic.
In the sense that, it was a_ such a simple life.
And we ate what we grew.
And, i had martins trying to nest, in my part of the hay loft.
So as i lay in bed in the morning with_ i didn't have a glass window, i just had a wooden shutter.
With the wooden shutter open, so that the light would stream in.
Martins would fly into my bedroom, and out again, to check it out and see if it was a good place to nest.
And there was a beautiful hill leading off to the black mountains, as the view out of my window.
And, it changed, and i took about seven or eight photographs, of that view, over the period of time that i was there.
Which was six or seven months.
Um, and it's really lovely to see it change, and i will remember that time as, very special.
But i do like living in the city better.
Ha ha.
They had books, and they had, a lot of books, about, people downshifting.
And, moving from high-powered city jobs, out, to the countryside to set up their own farMs  um, and i read these.
And i found them a great comfort when it was all a bit much.
And, i think i left, about a week after i'd finished the last, book.
Ha ha.
I think i then began to feel all alone, stranded in the countryside, and that it was time to go back to the city.
Hmph."
"My uncle Howard is a big practical joker.
But one time my sister and I got him back.
Um, it was last summer and a friend of mine from New York came to visit me at my house in northern Michigan.
And, he had actually arrived in an airport in Detroit which is farther south.
So on his way back from the airport, my sister and I asked him to drop us off at my grandma and grandpa's house.
Which is probably two hours from my house and two hours from Detroit, right in the middle.
So, we were on our way to my grandparents' house, and as just about, as we were about to pull in the drive way, my sister had this great idea for how to surprise my uncle.
So she told me to duck under the seat so that they wouldn't see us.
So my sister and I were hiding in the seat.
And in pulls Steve in his little_ Steve's my friend's name, in pulls Steve in his little car.
And so Steve got out, of the car and he went to ask my uncle Howard for directions for how to get to Detroit.
And my uncle Howard looked at him kind of weird, because Detroit was a, was probably about two hours away from my grandparents' house.
But he thought that was, okay, and he told him directions.
So Steve walks back to the car.
And then my sister, pops up and she tells him, ""go ask him for a drink of water.""  so Steve walks out again and he asks my uncle Howard for a drink of water.
Well, my uncle says ""all right"" and he takes, him inside and my grandma gives him a glass of water and, they talk for a little bit about whatever, that Steve's on his way to Detroit and what he did on his vacation and, he's kind of making things up.
And so far my uncle isn't too mad.
So Steve comes back out to the car one more time.
And my sister asks him, to ask my uncle Howard to please let him use the bathroom.
So Steve gets out.
He is been very good-natured throughout this all.
He gets out, and he asks my uncle Howard if he could please use the bathroom.
Well by this time, my uncle's gotten very very upset and he told him, ""just go out back.""  and so St- then my uncle was quite mad and Steve, obviously didn't want to go to the bathroom behind my grandparents' house.
So, he came back to the car and he's like, ""i don't think that this is a good joke to keep doing.
He's getting really mad at me.""  so, Laurel, my sister, and i, finally got out of the car and we went over and we were like, ""Uncle Howard, surprise.""  and then_ so we all had to laugh about this and, to this day this is one of the funniest jokes cuz it's the day, everyone finally got back at uncle Howard. "
"I started studying homeopathy, in my mid-twenties.
The idea came to me, one summer.
And I'd already changed career, three times, since I left university.
And so, I was very strict with myself, and said, that I wasn't allowed to study homeopathy, this year.
But if I still wanted to next year, ha ha, I would.
And I did still want to the next year.
So, I bought all the books on the reading list.
Read them all, still liked it, so I enrolled in a course in Devon.
And, it was very, interesting.
Both as, a healing method.
I've had homeopathy, and, um, other people I know had had some, and i, i_ it seemed to work.
Um, I wouldn't say that I was, kind of, a real total believer.
But, I was prepared to give it a go.
And, um, I was interested in... Being taught it really.
Mm, because I was curious.
Um, but I found it also particularly interesting to study.
Because you view_ because it's a holistic therapy, and, you view a patient as a whole person.
And then you match them with a whole image of a remedy.
It's a, uh, a great training in s- sort of some pattern recognition, in psychology, and in events in the world.
Which is very useful, for, fiction writing, and just amusing yourself in all sorts of ways.
Going, 'mm, that's like that.
Oo...'In fact, when I was, kind of_ towards the end of my training, uh, I would_ I was rather inclined to categorise everybody on that, all the time.
At the back of my head I was going, 'mm, a bit of a (xx xx), hmm.
' Ha ha, and it was probably very annoying for all my friends.
Um, it was great fun to study.
But, I just wasn't quite convinced enough, of... The, the truth of it, to sit someone down and take money from them, for my consultation.
I do prescribe for my friends.
And I do prescribe for myself, now.
But I couldn't actually make a business out of it.
I just_ I wasn't_ st_ there's was_ there's a level of confidence when you take money from people, that I didn't have.
So, i, I haven't carried on with it in that way.
But, I seem to have cured my brother's, um, permanent hay fever.
He had it all year round.
Um, and I reckoned, you know_ I mean it was_ it's pretty disabling to be, constantly, streaming eyes and streaming nose.
And none of the, um, sort of antihistamines he took seemed to really help.
And that's fixed.
And I'll reckon that's a worthwhile use of two thousand pounds, as well as having some fun studying interesting stuff.    "
"I am a grandfather.
Although you'd never know it.
I have two grandchildren, whom I've never seen.
I have one, child, a daughter.
A violinist, who's married to a physician.
Who is a gene g-e-n-e doctor.
They live in Manhattan, and, um, we don't get along.
I have never seen the children.
I haven't seen her since, a few weeks after her marriage, about ten years ago.
Her name is (Nadjestra).
Her mother was Russian, and_ for_ for short his_ her name is Nadia.
I myself, am the son of a worker.
Which may explain some of the things I have been able to do.
And other things I could not do.
My father, was a structural, steel, ironworker.
Very rough trade, dangerous, hard work, and very high areas, thousands of feet above the ground and all, you know.
And I had five brothers, no daughter, no sisters.
And I tried iron work, but I found it wasn't for me.
I just was too afraid of walking on a little, girder way up in the air.
Uh, they say you only can do this if you don't think about falling, just think about where the foot goes next.
By the way some American Indians like the Iroquois, from Canada, as well as upper New York state.
Make wonderful iron workers, because they can work at heights, without any less_ any, any loss of efficiency.
So I tried different things.
It was clear for me to do what I wanted to do.
My father didn't say I should or should not become a musician.
He didn't even know, nor did my mother, what it meant to be a physicist.
She said, ""son, is there any money in physics.""  I didn't know I was just a student.
I got through two years of it.
And sometimes... I get a little despondent.
And I think, ""how much easier things would be for me if I had become a scientist.""  gone through with what I started.
But it's a false illusion.
Now I would feel very unhappy, if I had to give up the hours each day I spend with music.
And, the joy I feel looking forward to a good lesson with a student.
I know it would take me, a few weeks of_ a few, taking the classes of_ as a senior here at the university.
Free courses, but it wouldn't last.
I would back- be in the same state I am in now.
Which is to say I have longings and great respect for people who, are physicists and mathematicians.
But you know there is always someone better at a job than you are.
I_ I'm pleased to hear that the Russian mathematicians are better than ours.
I am respectful, of friends who are scientists but that's about, it.
Most enthusiastic about music."
"I am a graduate student at the chemistry department of Princeton University.
And i'd like to give you some idea, how i ended up in Princeton.
I was born in Ukraine, and i received my undergraduate degree from Kiev Polytechnic Institute.
After i was done with my under graduate degree, i started thinking about my options for the future career.
First option was to, try to find some job in Kiev.
Another option, was to look for the continuing of my education in Ukraine.
And, finally, one more option was to finish my education in the United States.
Well, due to the number of reasons i decided to choose the third option.
And, in nineteen-ninety-six i became a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, in Duluth campus.
I spent approximately two years, as a student, at master's program in Minnesota.
And after i was done with that part of my biography, i decided to move to w-, to a warmer climate.
And i decided that Princeton would be, a fairly nice place to spend five years.
And, this way i ended up as a graduate student at the chemistry department here at Princeton.
Right now i'm working in the area of biological chemistry.
In particular, i'm working with the computer based applications, for the drug design, and for the study of drug action.
And, right now, i think that we're working on some, fairly interesting projects and hopefully by the end of my P-H-D i will receive some interesting and exiting results."
"I started to study English approximately four years ago.
In fact, before that time, i was learning_  i was trying to learn German.
But unfortunately, it turned out that i wasn't quite good student, student at German.
The reason probably was that i simply didn't like that language.
And i decided to start learning English simply for a hobby.
It happened when i was approximately nineteen or, eighteen-years-old.
At that time, i already was a student at the university in Kiev, in Ukraine.
Well i decided that that ho- hobby at some point in time, could be useful.
And i decided to start learning English on my own.
And the first book that i bought was the book for, uh, self study.
It consisted of a number of lessons.
And i was supposed to read... The material, to repeat, repeat it to learn the words, and so on.
And it was supposed to take about a year, to complete.
And i discovered that English language appeared to be much more attractive for me.
And especially, one more, interesting point was that the English grammar simply did not exist for me after German.
Because German language has very complex ger- complex grammar.
It has something like seven, tenses.
And there's a lot of... A lot of very difficult stuff for a learner.
That's why English attracted me at first.
But, then i simply liked it.
And as for a beginning learner, i decided to, use some very interest- interesting technique for learning words.
For example, i started to learn words not, in pairs, for example, i did not, take word and, its translation and i wasn't trying to learn, the pair of words.
I was reading texts.
I was trying to read some, simple passages some simple texts some simple information, and so on.
And when i was encountering, some word that i did not know at that point in time, i was looking for it in the dictionary.
And, i was trying to put that, word into a context, to learn its meaning, instead of the word itself, to try to feel what it means in the particular text.
And, i think that technique was, pretty useful for me.
Because, the whole thing worked pretty fast.
And, at the end of the first year, of my study in English, i started to talk a little bit.
And i started to, to read some fairly complicated texts.
And, what really helped me with English was, the possibility of communicating with the English speaking people.
It happened, approximately three years ago when i had a chance to talk to American students, who were visiting at Kiev.
They had a business trip to Kiev and i helped them as an, as an interpreter.
At that time, i had, pretty good knowledge of English, but i did not have a lot of practice at spoken language.
That's why it helped a lot at that point in time.
And... The coincidence was that the next day after those students were departing for the United States, i was supposed to take my toefl test in order to apply for the graduate program in the United States.
So that was particularly, helpful.
And definitely, i would think from, from this point in time that very, useful thing for studying English is to use... The communication with English speaking people.
Because definitely nothing can replace that in the process of learning English.
It's particularly true for my own case.
And i think that it helped a lot, a lot with my learning the- this language because it's been, just four years since i started learning the language.
And, i think i rec- I received some fairly good results."
"Um, I was speaking with my girlfriend yesterday.
And we were talking about... How ideas pop into people's heads.
How, how people come to think of things.
How they're reminded of things.
Um, the brain_ I'm a, I'm a psychology major.
And I took a cognitive psych class.
And this is what my professor taught me.
The brain, works like a network, like a networking system.
There are_ it's I guess like a web.
And, when things_ you_ when you learn new things, you place them some where on the web.
And... Though_ there're net_ there are connections that are made other things around it.
Like, th_ you can actually think of it in terms of a, physical map, where, where it's got like stems coming off of it.
Like let's say, you're thinking of a dog, the stems right around the dog, might be cat, um, owner, fur and, in turn, in, in turn the thing around the cat might be rabbit,uh, cat food, dish and like that, and, so and so forth.
You could actually_ that's why sometimes like, if you think of dog_ if you see a dog, you might think of, um, you might think of your, your cat at home.
You know, you might think_ maybe your cat at home's name is like, uh, Spot.
And you might think Spot was a dog you had when you were a kid.
And i,t it_ the connections are pretty incredible how ,and how quickly it happens.
Um, we were driving home and I saw a deer running across the road.
And I thought_ and i, I realized how, how quickly I thought.
I thought deer.
And the deer reminded me of a dog, the dog that happened to pop in my head was my friend's.
My friend, was, recently in a plane crash.
And that reminded me of something else and, just by seeing the deer all these string of, these string of memories popped into me, popped into my head.
And um... And uh_ uh, whatchamacallit.
That's why sometimes things pop into your head.
And that's why, maybe if you'r-e_ if you have a trouble thinking of something, you could just think of things that might be related to it.
And it will pop into your head, because, those connections might fire.
And, um, it'll, it'll come close to the area where the actual memory of the n- of the object that you can't re- think of is.
If that's clear at all."
"I arrived in Hong Kong about four days before the hand-over, in 1997.
At this time... There was sort of a euphoria of, excit- excite_ um, lots of exciting things going on, and people_ um, it was a great time to be there.
Um... Lots of people, you know, going to bars, and I mean it was just, fantastic time to, to be in Hong Kong.
Um, and obviously on the day of the hand over, everyone knows it rained.
And, um, experienced massive, massive flooding.
And, it was just very exciting to be there, and to, be in a_ to actually live there.
I ended up living there for about a year and a half.
Um, i did have_ after a while i kind of got quite annoyed with the, the culture and the materialistic lifestyle that_ i mean i just, started to, think that, these people were only thinking about money and_ um, Prada handbags, or Prata handbags, if it's a rip off name or_ it's, um_ i just_ it's just all money orientated.
Shopping, shopping, shopping, until you drop.
Or window shopping.
It's_ but it's got_ it's fun.
The first six months were excellent.
And i had a fantastic time.
After that the novelty wore, wore off a little bit.
And, um, i, i kind of, i don't know i, i, felt it was a bit of a superficial, environment.
Um... Not, not_ i don't mean to sort of... Well that's, that's how i, felt about it.
But, um_ and then, uh_ but now, i mean it's, it's sort of a_ it's not so exciting i don't think it_ there's, um, a feeling of sort of despondency and_ but i don't know.
Ha.
Um, i think... I think what drives them_ i don't know, i think there's_ i, i admire them in a way.
Um, they're_ there's so much, um... But_ there's um_ they're always going to make money there.
They're so keen, they're so_ they've got so much energy.
That, um... You know, I can't sort of_ um, decry them too much.
But, um... I, i just couldn't really get on with, living there for too long.
It was quite nice to live where i did.
Which was slightly away from the metropolis.
It's a fantastic place.
I mean, full of energy, vibrancy.
But, um, a bit too much of a shopping mall, for me."
"Yeah, uh, life in Kenya, this is something that was very interesting to me as well.
I mean... I went to Kenya in, uh, in July of eighty-eight.
And i, i left there in September of ninety-one.
And, uh, there was a sharp contrast between Kenya and a lot of, uh, West African British colonies, or former colonies.
In the sense that,um, a_ at least in Nairobi, which is the capital of Kenya, the, uh, the climate was a little bit more conducive,you know, uh, slightly similar to, you know, what you have in Europe.
And, uh, i always joke with my friends that, uh, the British had a good time in Nairobi at least and, uh, spent a lot longer time there than they did in, uh, some countries in West Africa.
Where, uh, the, the threat of malaria from mosquitos, really... Did not allow them to settle down properly.
And you could see the tell tale signs of, the, the prolonged stay of the, the Brits in Kenya.
I mean, they helped them to, um, lay down a lot of infrastructure that, the Kenyans have fortunately built upon.
For instance, they have a very good, um, dairy processing system, which i am sure they narrated.
And they could have fresh milk, in boxes just like you would have here in, in the U-K.
So, that, that was really good about Kenya.
Something i really enjoyed.
At the same time, um, the, the people themselves, the people themselves, um, well, what shall i say.
Well, i, i maybe sarcastic in this (xx), but, um, some of my friends from West Africa and myself used to joke that, you know, that the country is more advanced than the people.
And this is not, ha ha, very fair, but that is what we said.
Um, because, um, Nairobi is quite a metropolis.
I mean, it is well, it is well built up.
You have a lot of infrastructure that... Is very much akin to what you have in, you know, in, in the west.
And, um, you had a good blend of, you know, Africa... And Europe, in the sense that you could live in comfort in Nairobi, and you , you know, you, you drive on a safari and you, you see the, uh, African jungle with animals living in the wild.
And that was quite interesting.
And, uh... Well, the language too, Kenya happens to be one of the, um, few African countries with a_ an indigenous national language.
Um, and they maintain, um, English as their official language, but they have... Swahili or Kiswahili as they prefer to call it, as their national language.
And, um, i, i like learning Kiswahili very much because, that was the only way i could really feel at home with other Kenyans.
Whether, I was in a public transport or shopping in the open market.
It was_ it always made a difference, if you could speak Kiswahili.
And also, um, i, i didn’t find Kenyans and the Kenyan security forces in particular, as friendly as other places in West Africa.
And it is always helped if you could speak some Swahili to them.
They could let you off the hook very easily.
Because, if you were stopped by, um, a Kenyan security officer and you tried to speak some English, they would take it as an insult.
And, uh, this was at the time even to study in Kenya, for foreign students to study in Kenya, the office of the president had to approve of that, and, and you had to have a student pass.
And you had better have that on you when you went out late in the evenings.
So, one of the things i really glad of while I there was travelling by, by road in public transport, especially going outside Nairobi.
Because, um, the, the drivers in Kenya, were very notorious for, you know, reckless driving.
And, in fact, more people died from road, traffic accidents than the, the_ than the people die of AIDS.
And that was a problem which the government was trying very hard to, to address.
However, i was very impressed with the high literacy rate of Kenyans.
And, uh, something which was not, not that, common in West Africa.
And you could find, um, Kenyans from almost all walks of life literate and reading newspapers.
And they even had newspapers written in the national language Swahili.
With that one the not Swahili kids can, you know, keep abreast of current affairs by reading that paper.
So all in all it was, a good time that I had in Kenya.
It was a rich experience that i had.
And, uh, to, to crown it all, i got married in Kenya, even though i married a West African there."
"Yeah, um... When i finished my studies in, in Kenya I went to, to Ethiopia, and i decided to do a six weeks course, in physical rehabilitation.
And that was at a time when, um, Zenawi's government had just_ or, the movement had just succeeded in, uh, ousting Manguistu, from power...  And, uh, Manguistu fled to Zimbabwe.
Well_ where he, got asylum or something like that.
And i_ f- f- for the first time in my life i was in a society that was, highly militarised.
I mean every, every fifth person is on the street, was either a uniformed military person or plain clothed person, carrying weapons.
It ,it was, very_ it was very strange for me at that time because, the war in my country had not started.
And we had never been at war in my country and, we associated soldiers to be in the barracks.
Not walking freely like civilians with arMs  so i, i ,i found that very interesting in Adis Ababa.
And, um... Of course the people there are very, very friendly and i, i enjoyed my six weeks there.
And, uh, from there i_ coming back from West Africa i had a choice of, being in transit in, in Nigeria for one day, or spend, three days in, Cote d'Ivoire.
Ha, and, ha, yeah, i'm not going to say what i want to say, uh, really because, i , i might be a little b- bit unfair to Nigerians.
But i ended up, choosing to spend three days in Abidjan, and to spend one day, in, in, transit in, in Lagos, because, ha, well there are a lot of myths, about, uh, life in Lagos.
Some of which i think i would have to come find out myself.
But, um, i, i didn't look forward to spending one day in Lagos, you know, because, it, it's a rough place.
You know,it's a fast moving place.
And i'd not been used to that, to say the least.
So i decided to spend, a few days in Abidjan.
Uh, that was good.
I got a chance to practice my French, a little bit.
And i got to see, uh, uh, different layouts of the roads, like i mentioned early on.
And, uh, it was, it was quite different.
There, there were, some parts of Abidjan that, they called <em>Petite de Paris</em>, which is sma_ 'small Paris' because, it was an area well built up with all the infrastructure, that you are finding in a small European town.
And, um, yeah_  two days ago i also had opportunity to spend, uh, a week in Banjul de Gambia.
This is a small, country, very small country that, depends only on, receipts from garnered sales, and tourism.
And they are, they're developing very very fast.
And i think um they are doing so well because they don't have gold and diamonds for people to fight over, like is the case in other countries in Africa.
Quite a small country but, very very fast growing, economy and tourist industry.
It was quite good.
And ah, i also spent nine months in ninety-seven, in Guinea, Conakry.
And ah there i experienced, a similar level of xenophobia, as i experienced in ah Kenya.
And i i was quite shocked about this because ah, in the sixties and seventies when, Guinea had a oppressive regime, headed by sheik Toure.
A lot of Guineans you know went to Sierra Leone, to seek refuge.
And there they were able _  they are, they were very hard working, that i can see.
They worked very hard and they made fortunes which they, they were very hard working that I could see, the economy, into the other parts of Guinea.
So i was really shocked that, you know, when Sierra Leoneans had to, go to, Guinea Conakry you know, as refugees, they are not, as welcomed as one would have expected.
Of course some of the people who had been, to Sierra Leone, have taken some, Sierra Leoneans.
But ah, there was another group of people who, did not, move.
They were less hospitable.
And, ah, i think_ well this is a lesson for Sierra Leoneans to go back home, and, set their house in order.
But um, i i really really like travelling, and, i i always look for opportunity to ha travel more and more.
I don't I don't fear, flying at all as some people.
Just the other day ha i was talking to a friend and he told me that the arsenal for the ball club in England, did not make it in the European championship because, they had a striker, i mean he could not fly.
Yea and so he missed some of the matches and because of that, his team went down.
But I don’t mind flying at all, I like travelling, I like it very much."
"I have, an abiding interest in science, especially physics.
At college, Fordham University, I minored in physics.
Finding out that I really wasn't cut out for that kind of thing.
Because_ one reason is that physics requires work all day long, all day long.
And many physicists also play music, of course.
But one who I admire whose name was Schrodinger, Erwin Schrodinger had been a wonderful pianist.
But he stopped it completely so he could, um, concentrate on his quantum theory studies.
His wife played piano, but he wouldn't even let her have a piano and play in the house.
He was strictly for one thing, quantum theory.
Anyway, I usually watch for the, Tuesday New York Times.
Uh, the science section is very interesting about, colliding galaxies and all.
And I am very pleased, to know something about what is going on.
But of course, only looking at what other people are doing at this point.
Looking over the shoulders of others."
"Well, i mean, the question really is who aids who.
Um, Africa and the rest of the third world have been receiving a lot of... So called aid from, from the west.
At the same time, it so happens that, four out of the five permanent, members of the Security Council... Reduced eighty-six percent of the arms and ammunition, that go to Africa and the third world.
And it is these very, arms and ammunitions that, cause a lot of problems in Africa and, the third world.
That warrant aid from the west.
And somebody was going to do some mathematics to see, how much profit, the west gains from arms sales to, to, to the south, vis-à-vis the aid that goes to the same countries.
So, i mean, it is, it is a quite complicated issue.
All the same i believe that, um, a lot, a lot of the people who suffer... Are, are oblivious of all these politics.
And, um, even though humanitarian activities that are substitute for, um, good governance, but i think there are times when lives can be saved and livelihoods can be secured, by aid from the west.
Especially when it is timely."
"A while ago, uh, i had a strange dream he he.
Uh, in which i dreamt that i was gonna solve some famous murder mystery, by looking at some photographs or some pictures.
And i t- t- took no notice of that.
But, very soon after that i was approached by someone, who asked me to publish a book about someone called Jack the Ripper.
And coincidentally, the, the clues to the, this murder mystery connected with Jack the Ripper was to be found in certain paintings.
So, uh, i eventually published this book.
Anyway for those of you who don’t know Jack_ Jack the Ripper is kind of like, in, in Britain where i come from, the most famous murderer of all time really.
Although it happened, quite a long time ago in a Victorian period.
I think it was eighteen eight-eight.
Uh, oh, just in the summer of that period.
That, that these horrendous murders took place in, what was then Victorian London, i suppose.
And, maybe i shouldn’t put it this way but, uh, uh, but say five_ there were five murders i believe.
Five women were killed in, in the east end of London.
Which is, then maybe not a very nice area of London, very deprived, very poor.
And these were quite poor women, uh, who were murdered in the most horrendous ways.
But, I suppose five murders in terms of all the other things.
But i- it f- five murders that have really gripped, the imagination of people all over the world it seeMs   but certainly at the time it totally terrified London, you know.
People were really, really scared.
And, i suppose the, the strange thing about_ the, the murders were strange themselves.
The murders were very brutal.
And, in a fact they never actually ever found out who Jack the Ripper was.
I think, uh, the name Jack the Ripper comes from one of the, the notes that the, the guy sent to the police.
Cause he used to taunt the police as well, about the fact that they couldn’t find him, you know, and they didn’t know who he was.
So it was all very, strange and, and frightening.
Why people are still interested in it.
I suppose i- it’s what’s, one of the first, i suppose, crimes of the imagination in some ways.
Cause i- it wasn’t_ most murders, let’s be honest are about people who get angry with, uh, uh, the_ and in a moment of hatred or whatever, lash out and accidentally kill someone.
But this was sort of so deliberate and so, tied up with mur- uh, the imagination.
And it was the first time.
Or what people call a serial killer.
So we’ve had all these movies about serial killers and all the rest, and i guess Jack the Ripper was the first serial killer.
Maybe there were others.
But the first of that kind of strange, intense crazy killer, if you like.
That has become... More known now.
And people make films about them, and obviously these pe- people exist.
So there there’s continual interest from that.
With the_ because they never found out who, who the murderer was.
Uh, there have been lots of people that have come up with, theories about who he might be.
There have been loads and loads of books speculating about this.
Our particular book speculated that it was, um, actually was an artist, a very famous artist in this, country, or_ who was involved with it called Sickert, Walter Richard Sickert.
The_ who's, who was, um, one, one of the most famous of British artists of, of the time.
That obviously didn’t go down very well with the, the Sickert family.
But Sickert’s pictures are_ do depict all sorts of strange incidents and murders and cut up bodies and low_ what they call low life, i suppose.
Street life and stuff like that.
And there have been theories that it was, members of the royal family trying to sort of hush up, um, some sort of, maybe illegitimate children or marriages that they shouldn’t have had or, or whatever.
Uh, there have been, supposedly doctors have done it.
And say artists.
Perhaps Free Masons have been accused.
But i_ uh, there’s very few people who haven’t been accused of being Jack the Ripper.
It’s something that can_ grips the British imagination and, uh, um, perhaps people around the world.
And i guess it’s gonna grip our imagination for an awful lot longer to come."
"I went on to, a boarding school later on in life.
When i was thirteen years old.
And, it was a convent boarding school.
There was_ um, it was run by German nuns.
The Precious Blood Sisters.
And... I had an older sister in the school and that is why i was sent to the school.
They had very, very strict rules.
We were not allowed to look out of the windows in the dormitory.
We were not allowed to look out onto the road.
We were supposed to go for, mass twice a day, on Wednesdays.
And once-a-day throughout the week.
We could not miss Mass even on Sundays.
Even if you were Muslim we had to go for Catholic Mass.
And there were very strict rules.
We had to wake up at five in the morning.
Um, the food was terrible but, it was, much better than some of the food we had to live with at home.
At least there was enough of it.
And... I studied very hard because i wanted to be a doctor.
But it didn't work out that way.
Um, after i left the boarding school, i went to another boarding school, that was very lax.
The rules were very lax, and we could go out at night.
We'd go s- slip under the gate and go out, clubbing.
And nobody cared where we were.
So i hadn't wanted to go to that school.
And i told my dad but, he didn't want me going to another school.
Because he just wanted me in a boarding school.
But that changed my life because, they didn't let me do the subjects i'd wanted to do in life.
I wanted to do sciences, they wanted me to do languages, because i was good at those.
And, i ended up missing my chance to be a doctor.
When i left school, i had my eldest daughter.
That's Angela.
Uh, she was born a year after i left school.
And her father was in the university.
He'd already gone onto the university.
So we weren't living together.
Um... After two years i went to nursing school, because it was the closest to what i wanted- i wanted to do in life."
"By far one of the best experiences of my high school career was joining the marching band.
It was, one of the best decisions i ever made.
I play the euphonium, which is like a small tuba, and it's on, it's on the same octave as a trombone.
It just has three valves like a trumpet.
And, i joined the marching band in my ninth grade year.
And i had no clue what i was getting into.
But i just knew that some of my friends were in the band and it was going to be fun.
And it was.
I had a blast doing it, i did it all four years.
And i don't regret a second of it.
Um, it's a lot of work, but you get a lot of payoff.
Uh, it's fun because if you're a performer you get everybody to pay attention to you.
You get into all the football games for free.
And, all my friends were marching band.
And it's a real community spirit.
You all, work really hard.
And you_ you're all, part of this, big project.
And if one person's missing, out of this marching band picture, you notice it.
And so every person is just as important, as everybody else.
So you really feel, like worth something when you're in the band.
And everybody is given an opportunity to to perform."
"When i was living in Bangkok i had the opportunity to make, uh, several trips out to, uh,  Lao and Cambodia.
And that_ later i lived in Cambodia and was able to, take a good look around there.
But, one thing which both of those countries have in common is, the amount of land mines and unexploded devices there.
It was during the Vietnam war, the Americans carpet bombed most of Lao, and well quite a big bit of Cambodia.
Uh, secretly.
And, um, i’m not quite sure why.
But there haven’t been that many efforts to clean up the, uh, what they’ve dropped.
In, uh, in the_  especially in southern Lao and in eastern Cambodia.
Which is very sad.
For some of the places that they’ve dropped these, uh, cluster bombs there, is, uh, really, really beautiful spots.
Particularly around an old Khmer temple in the south of Lao, called Wapu.
And i went to see this temple, oh, it must have been about a year ago.
And, um, i went up to the main temple, which is absolutely wonderful.
Dating from the sixth century.
With the carvings of Vishnu, uh, fighting demons and so on.
And then i heard that there was another much smaller temple, maybe even dating from as far back as the third century.
A couple of kilometres just to the west of this temple.
That was all i knew, just that it was is_ to the west.
So, anyway i struck out through the jungle, trying to find this temple which would_ i found it in the end after asking directions from a few farmers.
But, it was really nothing more than a couple of, um,  Shiva Lingams which are the phallic shaped stones.
Which they_ the ancient Khmer just seem to have been put at different places where they_ which they found along the Mekong.
And i was, (sniff) trying to take a photo of these LingaMs  and, (sniff) i had, had to take a step backwards, and just behind me was one of these old cluster bombs, sticking out the ground.
And, god knows how many more of them there would have been in the jungle around there.
But i was really quite shaken by that.
And, had to sit down and have a cigarette before, hehe, i could move on, and try and get back to the path.
And then later on in Cambodia because, the, the civil is still, kind of, uh, sputtering  in the far west of the country.
And, people are recycling the land mines there now.
Which were the, the weapon of choice during the civil war.
But, um, they recycle them.
I mean the- they’ll go into old battlefields and, dig up the mines.
And then just carry them and lay them somewhere else.
And it’s not just the army which does this.
But_ um, just villagers who live in mined areas.
Um, they’ll put, mines on their garden paths at night, to keep robbers away.
Or, if they have a particularly productive fruit tree, like_ especially the trees which, uh, make palm wine.
You will often find, uh, land mine at the bottom full of those at night.
And, uh, the mines can get, washed around by the river if there’s a, a big rainstorm.
It’s very common to find, uh, land mines just at the banks of rivers, and so on.
And although there are lots and lots of NGOs in Cambodia, trying to, uh, make people aware of the dangers of mines.
It’s still really difficult to get that across cause there’s a real_ there’s a big kind of feeling it could never happen to me.
I could never get blown up by a mine.
And in almost every village there’s, um, a couple of mines lying about.
And little children, if they’ve_ well like, hehe, any child they, want to see explosions and, they don’t televisions, to be able to see them there.
But i have watched_ just throw rocks at a mine or poke it with a stick until it goes up.
Or_ and also quite_ in quite a few places, uh, in Lao as well, uh, the breadwinners of the family, the fathers, may even be, uh, diffusing the mines themselves, to sell as scrap metal.
Which is very dangerous, and that only, only makes people_ well it, people don’t really realise how dangerous mines are if, if their father is likely to have a mine that he’s dismantling in the, in the basement, hehe, kind of thing.
But in some places in eastern Lao_ i’ve never actually seen this, but i have, i have met people who have been there and seen it.
The carpet bombing was so intense, that it took away all the trees and all the vegetation.
So that the only things the villagers had to build their houses with, were pieces of shrapnel, and old bomb casings.
And you can see entire villages, made out of war debris.
Sounds incredible.
So as, as crazy as it might sound people have actually been able to make a living, out of the mines and this devastation.
And they’ve been able to actually turn it, uh, into something they can use for their own benefit."
"So, I took, uh, Spanish as my second language of choice.
We_ it was a kind of a mandatory thing.
And I had to pick, between Spanish, Germany_ German and French.
And so I picked Spanish, because my brother took that.
And, I don't know, I don't_ I honestly, I honestly do not remember learning English in any way.
It was, uh, they were like, ""okay, here's a list of nouns to memorize"" and ya- I mean they test you on the vocabulary.
And you learn th- how to say ""tree.""  and you learn how to say ""toilet"" in the same sentence.
And it doesn't really seem how it goes together at all .
And it_ and I kept like expecting it'll,  later it'll, it'll come together.
And it did later.
That you get to learn the the verbs and the, the different words you're supposed to throw in a the sentence, to make anything make sense.
And so, for the first two years honestly I think we just, memorized lists of things.
It's a pain in the butt.
But I mean you need to know all the vocabulary.
I can't,  I can't fathom how I could've learned all these words in English and_ because there's three words for the thing over there.
The_ like_ and just_ it's pretty astounding.
And they never_ they don't really try to do that in Spanish though.
They didn't say ""let's learn synonyms of things.""  they were trying to make it pretty much, standard and, uh, organized so you could figure it out.
And so you would know what to say at the point.
They didn't really draw on that point.
And, so you learn a lists of nouns, and you learn a list of verbs, you learn how to talk in the present tense.
But even past_ I took, uh, (xx) Spanish one two three four A-P Spanish.
Even through Spanish two, you really couldn't, you couldn't talk to somebody in Spanish.
Because you, you could only speak in the present tense at that point.
Maybe you might have learned past tense.
But I mean in normal conversation, you're at_ at one minute you're talking about the piece of paper in front of you.
Two seconds later, you're talking about, when you were over in Egypt visiting somebody.
So that's completely different tense.
And then, it had a whole different conditional probability, and all these different tenses that I didn't even know existed in English.
They say they do.
If someone asked me, what is the subjunctive language, like how would you_ what' the subjunctive form of, to go, in English.
I I couldn't even tell you.
I don't even know.
It's it's_ I guess the way they do it, is that, it, it seems so much different from the way I learned in English.
Cuz it's the whole idea of total immersion.
Like once you're around them, you'll just pick it up as you go.
And, that has to be the only way to go.
Unfortunately the, the, the class, is, it couldn't do that for you, because you're with other people who are learning it.
So they don't know it.
But in the end you learn that_ you learn the tenses and, uh, learn the language as fast as you can.
And, uh, the only the test I've had is that I have a friend who has, a housekeeper who speaks only Spanish.
And so whenever I go over there, to his house, like I try to say something.
And you know_ and she's very nice, and she's_ I mean she knows that I'm trying to say something, and I'm pointing at things and I'm making up words.
And it all, it all gets a across.
But it's definitely, it's definitely an experience that is hard.
And it's, it's not_ I'm sure I'm not unique in it.
But it's, it's unique from everything else I can think of."
"About life in the United States.
It's... Not that, um, much different from, um, what i have in China.
Cuz i'm still a student.
And i_ uh.
Most of my life is just go to class and, you know, try to_ try my best to do everything, um, i can.
And um_ but there are yeah, there are differences too.
You become, uh, more independent here.
Like_ like back home i don't have, um, too much chance to_ to get work.
To get to, uh, to know more about the_  the whole society.
I mean you just, live on campus, you know, all your friends is from_ from class, uh, at your same age.
But here, uh, as i came here i got the job in, uh,  Department of  Finance as research assistant.
It's just like a job, it's_ you go to the interview and, um, you know,very formal, and people, uh, you know, choose you to_ to work there or not.
And they pay_ they pay for you.
And you gotta work twenty hours a week, um, to got (get) the pay though.
And, um, um, you work there.
You become, um, uhr, how do you say.
A part of the_ the University, you're not only the student.
You also work there, help other students, and you get to know more people, the faculties, the staff, secretaries.
And you have more chance to know what their, um, everyday life is_ looks like.
So, um, then more chance to make friends with people.
And that's_ that's  the most interesting part i like.
You, you, uh,  know people from all around the world.
Cuz United States is_ like people is so, uh,  diversified.
They're not just, Americans.
They're Americans, they're Africans, Eng- they're from England, from Japan, Korean, Pakistan, Jordai- Jordan, um, it's very interesting.
You learn different cultures.
You learn, um, compromise.
You learn hahaha_ um, yo- you learn_ um,how do you say.
You become more, more, um, you know, diversified yourself."
"We all know the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, whose grandmother, a wolf in disguise, tries to eat her up, and she is eaten with her grandmother, and the cake that she was supposed to bring her grandmother.
But the true story, is all_ is about a, a little girl named Little Re_ Little Golden Hood.
Who wore a golden cloak, not a red cloak, and whose real name was actually Blanchett.
She lived in a little town.
And_ where all the people thought she and her grandmother were witches.
Her grandmother was so old, and no one knew her age.
Her grandmother had made her, this golden cloak.
And, it was known_ it wa- it was thought to have magic.
One day her mom says to her, ""let's see, if you can find your way by yourself, to your grandmother's house to bring her some cake.
She is sick now so, I think this cake will make her feel better.""  so little Golden Hood says, ""sure I can do that.""  her mom warns, ""don't sto- don't stop and talk to strangers, just get straight there and come back."" so off Little Golden Hood goes.
She gets_ she_ to get to her grandmother's house, she must cross the woods.
At the beginning of the woods, a, a wolf is hiding behind a tree, thinking, should he p_ should he pounce on this, what_ Little Golden Hood and eat her right there."" no"" he thought, ""there are two woodcutters around the corner, they may kill me.""  so, the friendly wolf, walks up to Golden Hood and says, ""hi.
How are, how are you.""  Little Golden says, ""hi.
Do you know me.""  he says, ""no.
But I like to, I like to meet you.""  he says, ""my name is Friend Wolf, what's your name.""  my name's Blanchett, they call me Little Golden Hood.""  so he says, ""where are you headed Little Golden Hood.""  she says, ""to my grandmother's house.
She is sick and I have to bring her some cake.""  so, the friendly wolf says, ""well I'm going that way too.
I'll get there quicker because I'm, I'm faster and you ha- you have such small legs.
So what I'll do is I'll get there, and I'll tell your grandmother that you're coming, and she'll wait for you.""  so she said, ""okay, bye bye."" the Friend Wolf rushes off, and gets to the grandmother's house, in about two minutes.
Little Golden Hood, gets there in about ten minutes.
Now during this time, the wolf go-goes into the house and sees that grandmother's not home.
But she's left her bed unmade and her, her head wrap on the pillow.
So he goes in and puts the head wrap on and lays in the bed.
And acts like the grandmother.
Now Little Golden Hood, knocks on the door, and the wolf who's acting like granny says, ""come in.""  Little Golden Hood goes inside, and says, ""grandma how do you feel.
Mom has sent over a nice piece of cake for you.""  and then she says, ""wow.
How like you are to Friend Wolf grandma.""  and, the wolf, replies, ""that's on account of my night cap.""  and Little Golden Hood says, ""what hairy arms you've got grandma.""  ""all the better to hug you, my child.""  says the wolf.
Little Golden Hood says, ""what a big tongue you've got grandma.""  ""all the better for answering child.""  ""oh what a mouth full of great white teeth you have grandmother, grandma.""  and the wolf says, ""that's for crunching little children with.""  and the wolf opened his jaws wide to, swallow Little Golden Hood.
As, as he clamps down, he got her cloak instead of her head.
She fell to the floor, and, he began to scream.
His mouth began to burn.
The cloak was made of magic, and made the wolf's mouth burn.
At that very moment grandma walked in."" aha, what are you doing.
We caught you there didn't we.""  so, the wolf began to run and the grandmother caught him, in he_ in, in her sack.
She dragged him out to the river and threw him in.
And while gasping for air the wolf drowned.
And the grandmother exclaimed, ""good riddance to bad rubbish.
We'll make a, we'll make a, we'll make gloves out of your fur.
And I'll give them to my granddaughter to protect her.""  and, the grandmother took Little Golden Hood, back into the house.
And, uh, let her eat cake and hot chocolate and, uh, rest.
Little Golden Hood went home and told her mom the whole story.
And of course her mom was upset.
And scolded her time and time again, until at last she forgave her.
And Little Golden Hood swore never ever to talk to strangers in the wood again.
Especially those who say they are friendly wolves."
"Hi i’m, um, Lucas and hopefully i’m gonna help you, learn a bit of English.
How people in Oxford talk about it, and the way we talk and so on.
Basically, like, i’m your average person who lives in Oxford.
Well, yeah.
No one’s average.
Everyone’s different.
And since i’m different that makes me average.
Um, I love this place.
Love everyone in it.
It’s quite lucky.
I hope you come here, 'cause it’s, it’s not like your average city.
It’s not, um, it’s not so big.
It’s not like Winnipeg, uh, where my dad comes from.
Which is huge.
The roads are huge and everything’s wide.
Um, everything’s very, very compressed because it was built so long ago.
Um, uh, every- everyone’s part of everyone’s life in Oxford.
Everyone knows each other.
You get loads of groups of people who associate with each other and, it’s, it’s quite a complex place because it’s so small, and there are so many things going on.
Like all the music and, uh, all the films and everything.
I mean like there’s, some pretty astounding music.
It’s quite controversial.
A lot people say that the music in Oxford is nowhere, and it’s tiny.
And i, I agree with a lot of other people who say we’re very lucky, for the amount of people we’ve got, we’ve got a huge music scene.
With loads of different kinds of musics.
Um, loads of different styles.
Loads of different really good singers.
And I work with a, a singer whilst I pay for my, uh, tuition fees.
Who’s not too good.
So, uh, I won’t talk about him.
He’s all into really loud singing with lots of laaaahs and ruuuhs and it’s all sort of heavy metal influenced.
I’m much more into a calmer sort of m- more musical, technically arranged thing, like jazz or reggae or, especially_ I said jazz and reggae like Herbie Hancock, and, um, old reggae.
Ska.
Um, eh, the specials.
Which I've recently recorded a few, a few choice songs from here and there onto a tape with a bit of ragga which is_ it's like reggae.
It’s not, it’s not reggae.
No ragga came from reggae.
Rag is sort of a, really, really fast, uh, beat w_ the lyrics and the words really fast.
Um, really speedy.
And the beat is, is simple.
And, it’s done, it’s done how dance music is created on, on decks, records_ players with a mixer and sampler and a collection of records basically.
And it, it’s like nothing you’ve ever heard.
It’s becoming very fashionable at the moment.
With a lot of people I know.
It’s, uh, it’s very, very unique.
It’s not_ it’s an acquired taste.
At first it’s, it’s like alcohol.
At first it tastes bitter.
It sounds bitter.
Sounds too fast, too aggressive, uh, too nasty, about nasty things.
But once you start deciphering it within your head.
And once you've learnt about it.
And you, you know a bit about this person and that person and why they did this.
You start to appreciate it, because it is actually_ it’s quite a spiritual music.
It’s got quite a lot of moral, uh, views in it.
And it, it helps people_ when reggae and ragga is playing it helps people to keep their heads straight.
It makes_ it helps them not make bad decisions, I believe.
Because you’ve got, a very loud voice in your ear, telling you to be a nice person.
And telling you not to go and have fight.
Um, so you’re less likely too.
'Cause it’s in your face.
And it’s brilliant to dance to.
You can definitely, definitely move to this music.
It’s so quick.
So quick.
It would just be, running everywhere flipping about, trying to break dance, breaking you bones.
Hitting your head against other people, knocking into people this way.
It’s absolutely great.
And it’s usually played extremely loudly.
Which I like.
Cause the louder a music gets_ I didn’t like it at first, but now_ there’s, there’s something about the loud music.
The base line.
The way on, on a large music system the base line it, it’s got more to it.
There’s more hertz underneath it and above it.
So you can hear more of this base.
You can hear, more of the base note.
More of the, reverberation and the, um, can hear just more of the music.
And there’s more hi-hat.
There’s more trebles.
There’s_ it’s higher.
It’s faster.
It’s, you know, it's going places basically.
And anyone can be into it.
Um, it’s not like drum and base which is_ it’s getting evil.
It’s getting nasty sounding.
It’s too_ drum and base to me sounds too simple, and too_ base line is too loud.
Its_ hurts your ears.
I’ve got a deaf ear.
I’m deaf in one left ear at the moment.
Probably down to listening to too much drum base at a party.
Um, and some_ it is some_ it came from jungle.
Which is quite surprising because it doesn’t sou-_there’s like two forms of jungle at the moment.
You get jump up jungle which is, so those are high notes, and there’s loads of futuristic sounds.
And it’s real jump up.
You jump to the beat.
You_ the minute you hear it the, the introduction you’re dancing.
And it’s, it’s like there's a_ all jump up jungle has a set form to the song.
There’s an introduction.
Then from the introduction it, it drops.
It becomes, very loud and very fast, very suddenly.
And it’s mixed with something else.
And it will go on, and it will go on.
And then it’ll be changed, to another song, with another intro.
And it’s, it is, it’s a real_ you can get a really nice feeling out of this.
Because, well I don’t know I think i’ve heard somewhere that base helps you live longer and, and, uh, makes you feel younger even.
I don’t know.
It might, it might.
I think there’s truth in it.
It certainly makes me feel a bit young- younger and a bit more energetic."
"Follow your dreaMs  that's really, funny when you think about it.
Because through life we all have so many dreaMs  and some are followed and some aren't.
And one of my dreams that i never, did follow was, i was going to be a Broadway star.
I loved singing, uh, music was my life.
It still plays an important part in my life.
But, uh, when i was a young girl i didn't want to go to college, and i didn’t want to continue my education.
All i wanted to do was be a Broadway star.
So when i, told my parents that that was what i wanted to be when i grow up.
My mother and father said, &quot;very well, but if you want to take singing lessons first you have to finish school.
And then when you go out and get a job and you can afford to take singing lessons on your own.
You can then, be a famous stage star.
&Quot; so, sure enough i did finish, my education.
And i did_ with my first earnings squirrel away enough money, to sleuth out, a wonderful voice teacher.
And her name was Mrs Lawton, Mrs Avis Lawton.
And she was really a wonderful wonderful woman.
She was at least seventy-two years old if she was a day.
And would never admit to being past thirty-nine.
And would have a wig to wear for every special occasion.
And she was just a delightful lady.
But she really did put me through my, my, uh, my work.
Uh, she had me working and understanding how the body works.
How the body is an instrument.
The voice is not something that's just in the throat.
How it lives in your diaphragm and in your stomach, and in your sinus, passages.
And in your mind and in your lips.
And in, in your vowels and how you form words and enunciate.
And she really was a, a brilliant teacher.
And, um, her, her students were really a mixed bag of people.
They were of all ages, all backgrounds, all walks of life.
And in order to give us, um, public exposure, she would take her Lawton singers around to certain civic clubs and groups.
Uh, to practise singing.
And we would do choral work together as well as individual solos.
And, uh, she was quite pleased with my progress.
And then, uh, referred me to a, uh, coach, a professional coach who didn't really talk, or teach, m- teach me how to sing as much as how to sell a song.
And the vocal coach, told me that i was somewhere between, Barbra Streisand and Lani Casson.
And i had a tremendous mezzo-soprano range.
That i could reach high C over C and just could do wonderful things with my voice.
And, a funny thing happened after taking, coaching lessons for about six months.
It seemed that everything that i did sounded awful.
It seemed like i had lost some of my natural, singing skills.
Because now i was just so trained and little bit too, regimented in my approach to singing, and to voice.
And so, the more i thought about... The competition, and Barbara Streisand and Lani Casson, and then Marie.
I thought no, the world wasn't ready yet for Broadway stars with single names, as we have today like Cher.
But anyway, that was one dream i didn't follow.
And i don't regret it because i have had a wonderful life.
And music is still a big part of it.
So some dreams you follow... Some dreams not."
"The first book that i ever read by Terry Pratchett was called, <em>Men at Arms</em>.
It follows a group of, rather strange individuals, who are in the city watch, or the police.
Of a city called Ankh-Morpork.
It's a fictional_ disc world that they live on.
And, characters comprise wizards and witches.
Gholands and trolls.
Dwarfs and giants.
And, it's an absolutely incredible cast.
Some of the characters are, very very funny.
Most of them you can relate to somebody that you know.
And, it's very good to read.
<Em>Men at Arms</em>, is the funniest disc world model that i've ever read.
Its parallels with our modern world, are, very, clever.
He manages to have no technology, on their world.
Yet, so many things can be invented with imps and devils, and things like that.
People have their personal electronic organisers.
Which are, worked by imps with, special memories.
That know what's going on in the future, and they can tell you all about it.
Um, Death turns up in quite a few books.
And, unlike most people's traditional view of Death.
In these books he rides around on a large white horse called 'Binkie'.
And, there are very many things like that, which can cause quite a lot of humour."
"My first year at university has gone really quickly.
Considering that last September, I didn't know anyone, in Oxford.
And I didn't know Oxford area.
And to think now, that I know a lot of people.
I've made a lot of friends.
And, I think I know, Oxford quite well.
And I feel very comfortable living here.
When I first started in fresher's week, there was a lot of paperwork, and I went to collect information, and be shown round.
And it seemed quite tedious.
But it was also a lot of fun.
We did, uh, pub trips, and went to a comedy event, and there were parties.
It was generally getting to know people, and, and making friends.
Since then I go out, mainly with people from my course.
We get on really well, and we have a lot of similar experiences.my first year at university, I lived in halls of residence.
Which we had a flat of six people, and we shared a kitchen, and bathroom.
First of all, we didn't get on very well.
But, uh gradually, we sorted out the problems, and, uh, we got on a bit better.
But, uh, this year I'm living in a house with friends, which is better.
Although my first year at- in halls, was quite an experience.
And, uh, all added to the fun of, being at university.
So I'm looking forward to my next two years."
"I spent three years at Oxford university.
And it’s safe to say I really hated it.
I liked the first term.
But after that it deteriorated.
And by the time it ended, i’d a chip on my shoulder about Oxford university that, uh, hasn’t gone away nearly fifteen years later.
People always ask me why I didn’t drop out.
Or why I went there in the first place if I was gonna dislike it so much.
The truth about Oxford is, it’s not nasty in the way you think it’s going to be nasty.
You think it’s going to be the upper class.
You think it’s going to be snobbish.
You think it’s going to be like Brycehead Revisited (television series).
You think it’s going to be all Sebastian's and sort of people with names like Farquart and Smith and so on.
It’s not like that at all.
There are a lot of upper class people there.
But you don’t see very much of them because they’re all down in London having a good time with each other.
And they’re a relatively small proportion of the students.
What it is, is it’s nearly entirely professional classes.
The a number of people there from any sort of working class background is absolutely minimal.
And it loves itself.
And that’s the real problem is that it loves itself.
It’s a university full of people who, have all through their lives been top of the class.
Have been told how good they are.
Have been sent to a place that for seven hundred years has thought it’s the greatest place in the universe.
That spends it’s time, telling them how wonderful they are.
And where as a result of going there, that people can, if they choose, necessarily go on to successful and financially rewarding careers.
And this means that there is very little pressure on anybody to look at the place and say, “it’s not actually good.
It’s a myth.
It’s not clever.
The people who are here aren’t brilliant.""  because why should they.
They feel brilliant.
Everybody tells them they’re brilliant.
So they think they are brilliant.
But because of that it’s incredibly complacent.
The terms are very short so that, um, anyone who’s any good can teach you_ hardly teach you for any length of time at all.
Because they’re all off, having yachting holidays in south of France.
Or, writing their books and whatever.
So you don’t actually get a lot of high level, high quality teaching.
And the intellectual level itself is very low.
I discovered after about half a term of writing history essays, that I could get by by writing essays out of the Encyclopedia Britannica.
And i’m not very proud of this.
And I feel that I wasted my three years as a result.
But, once you find out you can get away with this.
And once you don’t like the place anyway, so you feel no compulsion to perform.
You don’t feel, that you’re getting anywhere.
You don’t feel it’s something you want to be part of.
Then you do necessarily skive and you get away with it.
And then you think “well what sort of quality is this.""    it’s also very socially ignorant.
Um, my mother’s a school teacher.
My mother was strike the year before I went to Oxford.
Probably had the only parent who was a member of a trade union or had ever been on strike while I was actually there.
Um, apart from the other people who were, um, children of teachers.
'Cause you find you, make up a little sort of special social group.
Um, because, the professional group in this country who are worst paid are, teachers.
So if all the sons and daughters of professional people are the people at Oxford then the teacher’s, uh, sons and daughters are going to be a little_ not very well off group at the bottom of them.
And it came to the point that, because it was snobbish in, that particular sort of way.
Because it was ignorant that pa- particular way, you would start going round at the start of every year, looking for the people who hated it already.
And they would fit almost a certain template.
They would tend to be provincial and usually, though not always, from the north.
They would never, ever have gone to public schools.
And usually, had gone to comprehensive schools.
And they'd tend to like football.
And there'll be about five percent, of the students.
But you can still spot them years later.
Because there are people who you meet, who went to Oxford university and they hate it.
And you will meet them in whatever context.
And you’ll sit down, and you’ll damn it for hours and hours and hours.
But of course it doesn’t matter.
'Cause Oxford university has been here for seven hundred years.
And it can take, you sitting in the pub and telling them how bad they are.
Because it will survive."
"I’ve spent fifteen years, not supporting the English football team.
Which is curious because i’m English and a football supporter.
Um, and_ which is such an unusual standpoint.
That my friends, who are used anyway to me having unusual and radical ideas, think it’s a joke.
They think i’m saying it to be provocative and to wind them up.
Simply because no one ever suggests to anybody they should not, support the, the English football team.
Now from where i’m standing that’s a good reason to not do it in the first place.
Because you have an idea that you can’t even challenge.
That’s a fairly, totalitarian thing in the first place.
And our first inclination should be to say, 'well let’s do the opposite and see what happens.
'Now what i think happens in practice, is that, sh- if we take for granted that nationalism is a bad thing.
That it’s a cause of, many wars.
That it’s, one of the nastiest political ideas, uh, to have ever entered our consciousness.
And it’s extremely been dangerous this century.
Then, we should be thinking very carefully about, waving flags and supporting our side, when we have a sport in competition.
Which does, after all pit one nation against the other.
With the intention of our nation beating their nation.
And with their nation trying to beat our nation.
Yugoslavia’s been drawn against Croatia in the same, group of the European football championships.
Um, i had a friend who was going to go before the war broke out in Yugoslavia recently.
Um, that strikes me as a game that, if played is highly unlikely to result in, in improved relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia.
There have been, games played_ there was a game played between Iran and the United States recently, that took on all sorts of... Meanings that were, extraneous to the game of football.
Simply because, Iran has effectively been at a cold war for with the United States for twenty years.
And the nature of a football competition has to be to make those things worse rather than to make them better.
It doesn’t necessarily make them worse in the sense that people are_ actually go to the games.
Or people who actually meet at world cups.
Or, you know, people who have a shared interest in football from the different countries.
Are necessarily going to fight over it.
Because they’re not, directly competing.
But it’s highly unlikely that anybody who’s ever seen England play West Germany or later Germany, on television.
And has then gone round the pubs of England afterwards.
Has felt that, that game has helped improve Eng- English people’s understandings of Germany_ people.
And no doubt if you were to go around in Germany and do the same thing, the same would be the case.
And so i find the only way to deal with it is to say, 'i hope England lose.
' Cause apart from anything else, that does at least raise the question of, 'is it a good i- idea for us to do this all the time.
' Some people say it doesn’t matter very much.
That, you know it’s only a football game and it’ll wear off by the morning anyway.
And so, while it might be true that football, um, increases nationalism, and supports nationalism it doesn’t do so very much.
The problem is that, in this country at least, there are very few ways apart from football, that we actually imagine ourselves as a nation, these days anyway.
The empire has gone.
There’s not a permanent war.
The monarchy is in decline.
And therefore those symbols that you associate with England and with us, pledging to be England.
And us identifying with England.
Tend to have largely fallen apart.
Whereas once, every couple of months, sometimes more often, the nation clusters round its television sets to, collectively and without opposition, cheer on eleven people dressed in white shirts, who identify themselves with England.
Therefore, far from being unimportant.
Football is probably the single most important symbol, in the promotion of nationalism, that we have in this country.
If you think nationalism is a bad idea.
And you’re a football supporter.
I think you want to ask yourself whether that’s something you want to join in with, or is it something that you want to get away from.
And for fifteen years i’ve not been supporting the England football team."
"Hi.
Uh, my names Bill.
I'm fifty years old, and I live in Mammoth Lakes, California.
And right now it's snowing.
And, when I look outside and see where I live i, have a tendency to, uh, think about where I've come from.
And, at one point of my life I was in the corporate world.
And I lived in New York City.
And, uh, if you haven't been there, it's an interesting place.
Uh, you might want to go some time.
But be careful.
Uh, when I was living there, which was uh, back in the early eighties, I um, asked a beautiful woman out.
Her name was Alison.
And it was my first and last date with Alison.
And uh, you might be asking why.
Well, we ha_ went out to dinner.
And then after dinner we decided to go to the Upper East Side, and uh, go out and go dancing, have a few drinks, and get to know each other.
And then we got in a cab, and we were at the intersection of like Second, and Lexington.
And we got hit from behind by another car.
It knocked us both out of the back seat.
And I immediately, uh, got out of the cab.
And, when I stood up and looked back at the car that hit us, a man walked up, uh, put a gun to my temple_ I will never forget this.
He had a pink washcloth over the gun.
And he said, ""if you move, I'll blow your head off.""  so I said, ""okay.
What do you want me to do.""  and he got_ he put me back in the cab, and they grabbed the cab driver, put him in their car, and they kidnapped us.
And uh, two people got in the front.
And they, uh, they said, ""give us your money.""  and, uh, we gave them everything we had, except I had a hidden pocket where I had a few extra bucks and I didn't give them that.
And they took us up, Manhattan, and then back down, [throat clear] pardon me, FDR Drive.
And basically, left us off, where they kidnapped us.
But, in the process of going up Manhattan, uptown to the East Side, they ran every light.
And there was no way I could grab Alison, and bail out of the car.
So, after they left us off.
We, uh, all got together, Alison, myself, and the cab driver, and went to the police station.
And, uh, made positive i-ds.
And then we went to an Irish bar, and got drunk 'til seven AM and, uh, you know, a few days had passed, and I say, ""Hey Alison, you want to go out again.""  and she said, ""no way McBride.
Uh, you didn't save me.""  and so i, you know, we kind of laugh about that, but uh, um, it was a scary time, and, um, and that's the thing about Manhattan is you have to be careful.
So in any event, I um, i_ I'm living in Mammoth Lakes now, where I was in the corporate world before, I now have my own little uh, business.
And where I had short hair before, and was a bit pudgy, I now have long hair, and my friends tease me that I look like Yanni [popular musician].
And I'm in good shape, because I like to ski and climb and run.
And uh, and that's one thing about living in the, Mammoth Lakes area.
Is that you can do, uh, physical activities year-round.
You know, sometimes you have to deal with the environment, but, uh, if you're willing to, you know, go out there and try, you're gonna have a good time.
Uh, the things I like to do, uh, include trail running, uh, nordic skiing, which is skate-skiing, and then the classic style.
I also like back country.
And I have a bunch of friends, and particularly during the spring, when the weather is nice, we'll go into the back country, and pick a line, and, um, traverse back and forth up a mountain, and ski down a gully, or a face.
And it's a lot of fun.
And, uh, we've never had any problems with avalanches.
And, um, it's, uh, it's always a pleasure to go up there, and take a look at how beautiful the area is, and be grateful for where we live.
Uh, this morning for example, with the snow coming down.
I took my dog into the back country.
And it was just us.
And we were able to ski through the trees with two feet of powder, and, uh, we just had a blast.
It's kind of fun watching him play, because he really enjoys the snow.
So, uh, as I'm moving forward in my life.
I, uh, I'm very grateful to be where I am.
And, um, that's my story, and I'm sticking to it."
"I had a friend as a childhood.
Um, his name was Nick.
And, all growing up throughout_ well I'll tell you Nick's story.
He as a child, was born into homelessness.
He spent the first four years of his life homeless living on a subway system in New York City with his mother.
Um, when he was about five or six-years-old his uncle took him in and began raising him as his father.
Um, i met Nick when we were both in the sixth, sixth grade.
Uh... And he was a special kid.
Uh, he used to_ he was really, really smart, really intelligent.
But, he looked funny.
He had really big ears.
So he got abused by people.
And, um, that, that never got him down though.
He took it very lightly, took it like with a grain of salt and, um, made friends with everyone.
Everyone liked Nick, even though we all abused him.
Um, all throughout grade school and high school, everyone knew that Nick was, going to be the successful one.
I mean, i was i_ at one time i was convinced that he would be a president.
Because he was just, so into that.
And he, he enjoyed_ he loved Nixon.
Uh, President Nixon.
And, uh, he loved politics.
And he was just so intelligent.
And, um, graduating from high school, he was valedictorian, got almost a full scholarship to Yale University.
Went to Yale, uh, was very successful there.
Played on the Yale football team, which was ironic because in high school, he was terrible at football although he never gave up, never stopped trying, always tried to play.
But, he just didn't have the talent to play in high school.
But like i said, he got to Yale and he just kept on trying and trying and trying.
And finally he got_ he made the team, and not only did he make the team, but he was voted the best player, on the offensive line on the team.
So it just_ it scr- shows how he never gave up.
Never_ he just smiled in the face of adversity.
He, he was always always willing, looking for challenges, always ready to overcome things.
So... His story goes on.
He graduated from Yale with um_ he graduated cum laude from Yale.
Um, got a job.
Took a job as an insurance salesman.
And... Ironically, one of his first flights as an insurance salesman, he had to fly to Maryland from New Jersey.
His plane crashed and he died.
And, that was_ it was a little bit hard for me to handle because he was always_ he was very inspirational.
He was a good friend, i mean, just to say the least.
And, uh, his death was something that just, shouldn't' have happened.
Everyone thought_ i thought especially that, it was just a waste of a life.
If anyone had to die it shouldn't have been him.
And, um, at first it, i was distraught over it.
For a while, i didn't really know what to do with myself.
But, um, i've come to, uh, use his story as, as even more of a motivation for me.
And doing things like in memory of him.
And, um... He's still_ you know,  he's still an inspiration of me.
I still think of him_ i used_ i thought of him for the first year after he died everyday.
Every day, i had thoughts of him, and dreams of him.
But, uh, now i think of him occasionally.
And when i do i just, i remember all the good things, and the good times we did have at least while, he was alive."
"Stories are stories, but er some people like to categorize them.
Some people talk of myths, which are stories of the imagination from long ago.
And we have legends, which are myths with a grain of truth in them like the legends of King Arthur.
And then we have folk tales, which we might call local legends.
I am going to give you now a myth from Greek mythology.
The Greeks had gods for just about everything.
This is the story of god Apollo and the god Hades of the underworld.
And this is the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.
Now Orpheus, as you may know, was probably the most famous player of the lyre, a beautiful Greek instrument.
And he was given a lyre by his father, the god of the sun, Apollo, and he played so beautifully upon that lyre.
He could charm the fiercest beasts of the forest.
Even the trees and the rocks would gather around to listen to it.
The streams would stand still so that they might hear the playing of the lyre and the singing of Orpheus.
He could charm the fiercest men, but, of course, he could charm the most beautiful women.
But he charmed the hearts of the most beautiful of them all, Eurydice.
And Eurydice fell in love with Orpheus and Orpheus fell in love with her.
And they agreed that they would marry.
But the happiness was short lived.
For on the very day of their wedding, even as she was dancing at the wedding feast, a snake came slithering through the grass.
Bit her upon the heel and Eurydice died on her wedding day.
But her soul went winging down into the underworld, the kingdom of Hades, where in the imagination of the ancient Greeks all dead souls went.
And Eury_ Eurydice was gone.
Orpheus realised that he could not live without her, but he decided that he would go down into the underworld himself and ask Hades, give him back Eurydice.
Now, no human had ever been down into the underworld, but so sweetly did he play upon the lyre that the ferry man carried him across the river between the world of the living and the world of the dead.
So sweetly did he play that the great beast who guarded the gate way to the underworld, a great three headed dog, Cerberus, lay down at his feet and allowed him to pass.
And so he went into the underworld and played his way through those dark caverns.
And the souls of the dead who flittered and fluttered about him, they didn’t stop him, they allowed him through.
And so he played his way until he came to the great chamber, where upon a black throne sat the god of the underworld, Hades.
And before him Orpheus plucked the sweetest tune from his lyre.
Sang the sweetest song, saying that, if he could not have Eurydice back he would prefer to stay down in the underworld himself with her.
To be with her dead rather than without her alive.
And when he finished his playing Hades looked at him and said, 'Orpheus, you have moved even my hard heart.
Yes, I will give you Eurydice back.
Now you go back the way you came and she will follow you.
But as you go, you must promise me you will not stop.
You will not speak.
Above all you will not look back.
Because, if you look upon the face of Eurydice before you reach the upper world she will disappear and you will never see her again.
Promise me that.
' 'I promise,' said Orpheus and turned and began to make his way back through those dark caverns.
And as he went behind him he could hear, nothing.
No sound of footsteps.
No sound of breathing.
No rustle of garments.
Was she there.
Was she following.
How he longed to turn but he remembered his promise.
But he fixed his eyes on that distant glimmer of light marked the gate way from the underworld.
Still, no sound.
Was she there.
He resisted the temptation to turn until the very last moment when on the very threshold between dark and light, between death and life he turned.
And she was there like a shadow following him in the darkness, form and shape, his bride.
'Eurydice.
' He cried and reached out to take her in his arMs  but his arms passed only cold air.
The sigh like the dying of a breeze, she disappeared back into the shadows.
Orpheus had broken his promise.
Never again did he look on the face and form of Eurydice.
Never again did his lyre play so sweetly.
Never again did he raise his voice in song.
But Eurydice and Orpheus live on in the story I have told you.
And if you happen to go to Lesbos, the Greek island of Lesbos, listen.
Listen for the nightingales.
For it is said that in his memory, for he is buried there, the nightingales of Lesbos sing more sweetly than anywhere else in the whole wide world. "
"Paganism...  In this country we’ve got, we've got a multicultural society now.
And there are lots of different, religions and spiritual paths.
It used to be, just one religion, Christianity here now, but things have kind of loosened up.
And one of the, largest or big_ fastest growing things happening in, in Britain, and i think in other parts of the world.
Is the growth of a thing called paganism.
Paganism, originally was a term of abuse.
It was almost like saying you have the beliefs of a country bumpkin, or, uh, someone from the backwoods.
Where as the religions such as Christianity or Judaism was thought of as very sophisticated.
But, strange people’s views now have, have changed and people have, maybe moved away from the, traditional religions at last.
And they’re trying to kind of do their own thing.
I think paganism_ put it this way, i- i- in a way you’re born a pagan.
Everybody is born a pagan.
You know it’s kind of like your natural state.
It’s a natural state of things.
So, paganism as a religion is almost like, the natural religion.
There, there’s a kind of ideas_ assuming that you’re the sort of person who likes to have a spiritual path or, or, or to think in those ways.
Which i know not everybody does.
Then it’s kind of like... You know fantasy religion in a way.
Or make up your own religion.
Or the.
The natural thing, the, the spiritual ideas that come to you naturally.
And, you know so that might be_ you, you wouldn’t have a, a kind of a priesthood.
It would be, do your own thing.
You know you don’t need to have someone tell you, what to believe or what to think.
You kind of make it up for yourself.
You make your own contact with whatever you think is the, the spiritual realm.
And that quite often involves_ cause it’s natural, a reverence for nature itself.
And, and the fact that you think, well, nature is a wonderful thing and maybe nature can actually teach you things.
And you can go out and, communicate with it or absorb the atmosphere and the vibes.
And that’s quite an important, aspect of, of what paganism’s like.
And it’s very much tied up, with cycles and orientating yourself to the natural cycles.
Cause i guess, a lot of pagans feel that, modern life has kind of divided us off from a lot of, uh, the natural patterns.
I live in city, in Oxford.
And even though it’s not a huge city the, the street lights_ you can’t even the see the stars really at night.
And you, you, don’t feel the elements.
And you know you’re kind of cushioned from all, all that sort of stuff.
And, some of us think maybe we’ve lost something in, in there.
And so people are trying to get back to that a little bit.
And, and to get sort of subtly back in tune with the cycles of nature.
And one of the_ as well as just, being in nature and kind of absorbing the vibes.
An important way of doing that is to kind of celebrate the turning of the earth.
So pagans, tend to celebrate_ this.
Uh, i, i mean, pagans have lots and lots of different views.
They have no dogmas.
They’re very tolerant.
But one thing that kind of does, unify them i- is this celebration of eight different festivals throughout the year.
You know, the main ones maybe being Beltane on May morning and Samhain or what’s known, uh, as Halloween.
Bu_ but there’s the solstices and the equinoxes or whatever.
So pagans tend to get together for, whatever they’re, you know the_ their particular style on, on those eight festivals.
And it_ as you celebrate them year upon year it gradually kind of reorientates you, and gets you back in touch with you,r your inner self.
And those sort of ideas, although they’re very simple, i think, most people can_ when they’re explained to them, can find something that, that there- there’s an element of truth in that.
Uh, and i guess because it’s, it’s say, you know get back to some of things that we’ve lost with modern life.
That must account for the fact why it’s growing so fast in Britain and in, in America at the moment.
And a good thing i think that is too.
Haha."
"I was living in Phnom Penh during a Chinese New Year, which is celebrated there quite fervently.
Uh, me and my colleague got a week off work.
So we decided to, uh, do some sightseeing.
And go down to the south of Cambodia.
And, uh, Kampot province which is very, very beautiful area.
And, uh, we even wanted to go up into the elephant mountains to see, the remains of an old French colonial resort, uh, call_ up at the top of a mountain called Phnom Bokor.
Phnom is Cambodian for mountain.
And this old, resort_ it was built in the twenties and thirties.
And it had a huge casino and, um, a big hotel with a ballroom.
He he.
Classy things like this.
The king, must have been King Sisowath back then_ had a palace up there as well.
But then in the civil war it, it_ there was a huge_ battle was fought up there.
And so nobody lives there.
And they, uh, mined the road up there and the hill, so much that people have only started going there in the last couple of months.
And a couple of the newspapers did stories on it and, told uh_ we learnt like where to go and what to see from that.
So there_ what’s up there, there’s, um, there’s the old French ghost town which includes the, uh, casino and the grand hotel.
Then there’s, um, a lookout point from which you can see, absolutely miles into the Gulf of Thailand.
Gorgeous.
And then there’s also, um, a watering hole where herds of wild elephant come, in the evening and early morning.
The nearest town to this is a provincial capital called Kampot.
So me and my, colleague, Pui, who is Thai, we took a share taxi down to Kampot then tried to find out about getting a motorbike, taxi.
Which is the way to travel in Cambodia, a motorbike taxi.
Up to the top of this hill.
Which is only about forty kilometres.
But people were asking for lots of money to take us up there.
And we weren’t, hehe, too keen on getting ripped off.
And just as we were giving up and deciding to go to another old French resort on the seaside called Kep.
I note two of my students who i’d been teaching in Phnom Penh showed up on their motorbikes.
And, uh, one of them had been up there before and he really liked it.
So he offered to drive us up there.
Which was kind.
And we agreed to give them some money and so on.
And he drove us up there.
It was, this guy and, two of my students, they are brothers, and me and Pui.
So we were two on a motor bike.
And it took us three hours to get up to the top.
To cover this forty kilometres.
Um, bec_ well the road was in terrible shape to begin with.
But then also some parts of the jungle, like creepers and vines had come out into the middle of the road.
And so whoever was sitting behind the driver had to keep fending these brambles off.
So he wouldn’t get prickles in the face.
So we got up to the top, of this mountain.
And then one of my students, uh, announced that his bike was out of petrol.
And that he’d need a tow to get up the rest of the way to the top of the mountain.
And, uh, they didn’t have any rope.
So i had to use my belt and my camera strap, to tow up to the top of this hill.
We'd already been on the road for, three hours.
He he.
I wasn’t gonna turn around, nine-tenths of the way to the top.
So we made it up, to the top and had a look around.
And it’s absolutely gorgeous.
The old colonial hotel, and the casino are massive.
With a big ballroom in the hotel.
And they still have the original tiles down there.
There's beautiful patterns on the tiles.
And, you can really get a sense of the grandeur that, that would have been there.
It was magnificent.
And up on the top, of this hotel.
You can get up onto the roof.
It’s about five stories tall.
The, uh, Vietnamese  army up there had put an antiaircraft gun.
And so there’s the relics of war up there as well.
Which, it’s a really strange place and there’s a very strong sense of history up there.
Um, during the civil war the Vietnamese were_ occupied the hotel.
And the Khmer Rouge were in, um, a small Catholic church, uh, five hundred meters away.
And, i- inside the church the Khmer Rouge have drawn pictures of themselves and written poems on the walls.
But, uh, i’m not able to read Khmer.
Hehe, i couldn’t tell you what they were.
So after we’d_ i had a look, a good look around the top.
There’s also, um, a Thai, um, a Thai style Buddhist temple there which my friend Pui went in_ and into.
There's, uh,  we, um, set back down again.
And had towing_ well there were three of us on one bike now, towing the one guy on the other bike.
And, he was stilling trying to get his bike work even though it was out of petrol.
And he kept putting it in gear and he eventually broke the chain.
Hehe.
My friend Pui, i don’t know how she managed to do it.
But she managed to fix it so that the back wheel actually ran.
Actually turned.
By doing something with a branch of a tree.
And, um, a strap from my bag.
So, i haven’t figured out how she managed to do that.
But she could ride a motorcycle when she was about seven so.
Anyway we were going down the mountain, and the bike which the three of us were on.
Because going down a mountain we had to use the brakes a lot, we managed to wear them out.
And, so we jumped on the other bike which Pui had fixed with the branch and the strap.
And freewheeled down there on that bike.
While the guy with no brakes just went shooting off down the mountain and we met him later at the bottom.
Yeah, and, uh, once we down on flatland we were able to, uh, get a_ we were able to be towed by the one with no brakes but still had an engine.
We made it back to Kampot.
And, uh, in the end i_ hehe, the cost of the repairs to my student’s bikes far exceeded what we would have paid to have got a motor taxi  up there.
Hehe.
But it was a wonderful trip.
And, unfortunately we weren’t able to see any of the wild elephants there.
But we met and Italian man who runs a guest house, and the safari tour down there in the town of Kampot.
And he said that, um, he was taking some tourists up there in his four-wheel drive.
When an elephant came out of the bushes and charged them.
For_ he charged them on this narrow track.
And he_ the_ he managed to get away.
He must have just reversed down the mountain, i guess.
And turned round to ask if_ the tourists if they'd got any pictures.
And he says they were all under the seats.
Hehehe."
"I've been very fortunate to have lived in, many different parts of the United States.
I was, uh, born and raised in Manhattan.
And, uh, always considered myself a street kid.
Uh, learning everything that is implied with that term, street smart, streetwise.
Where you, uh, you do learn a, a way of living and survival in a large, large metropolitan city, like Manhattan.
Uh, that you don't learn in other parts of the United States.
But, uh, i was born and raised in Manhattan and will always cherish that upbringing.
I felt that i was in a Heinz fifty-seven neighborhood.
It was very, European.
Uh, where we had uh Italian and French and Spanish and Hungarian and German.
And just all sorts of European influences.
And then, um, as time went on ,i moved to, uh, North Carolina.
And never realized that_ until i moved to North Carolina that i was a Yankee.
And that in North Carolina, uh, some people were still fighting the Civil War.
Uh, which is the war, between the North and the South and the States.
Um, and i thought_ well, i, i, took offense at that at first, because i thought, &quot;i'm not a Yankee, i'm an American.
&Quot; but then, the longer i lived in North Carolina.
And i wound up by being there a total of seventeen years.
You find out, that, um, when they started to call you &quot;a damn Yankie.
&Quot; that, that was supposedly a term of endearment.
And i really think it was just their way of getting around, their own embarrassment.
By calling you a Yankee to begin with.
And then getting to know you and like you, and adding the term damn in front of it, to call you a, &quot;damn Yankee.
&Quot; but i found in North Carolina, and in th- the south east for the most part, that people were, a lot_ uh, they were... Much slower in accepting you.
Um, but once they got to know you they, they accepted you without question.
They, um, would always say, &quot;come back, come back, um, come back soon ya hear.
&Quot; and you would wonder, &quot;i wonder if they really mean that they do want me to come back, or if they would welcome me if i came back.
&Quot; &quot;ya'll all come back really soon, ya hear&quot; that's what they said.
And i often wondered whether or not, they really, meant it and what they would do if i showed up on their doorstep.
And, uh, then i had the good fortune of, uh, accepting a job position in San Francisco.
And San Francisco considered, considers itself America's favorite city, and any one who has ever been to San Francisco automatically falls in love with it.
And i found the people there to be everything, that, you see on television and the movies.
They are very healthy, the sun shines all the time.
I never thought that i would miss the snow, and cold weather of the east.
But i certainly did.
And, um, there aren't that many seasons.
There is basically, two seasons, sunshine and fog.
And, then that's it.
Um, and then another move, took me to the midwest.
And i must admit that when i went to the midwest.
Although it wasn't as attractive as San Francisco or perhaps as beautiful as North Carolina.
That it had its own beauty.
In the midwest of the United States... You find, the people there have a very strong, affiliation with the land.
Uh, there_ it's a very, um, agriculturally based area of the country.
The, uh, the wheat fields and the corn fields.
And i know that, many people there would say, &quot;oh how could you, like living in the midwest when you have lived in places like New York City and, San Francisco and in, in, North Carolina and beautiful mountains.
&Quot; and i would say, that although those places are beautiful, that the midwest has its own beauty.
There's no place, where you can see a more magnificent sunrise or more magnificent sunset, than in the midwest.
Because the sun and the moon is as large, as anything you will ever see.
It's not covered, or obscured by buildings or trees or anything else.
And when you, look out across the corn fields at night on the prairie.
And you see the, the stars, you see more stars and more  brilliance, than you'll ever see anywhere else because it is so dark.
Uh, that all of the stars just seem to magnify a million times over.
And the people in the midwest, when they welcome you, they walk up to you, they look you straight in the eye and they say, &quot;how are you.
&Quot; and you know that they want to know, how you are.
Because they care about you the person.
Not about what you can do for them.
Or what success or good fortune you might bring to them.
That they really want you to be settled, and happy, and they care about you.
And to me, of all of the places i have lived in this country.
Although i will never forget where i came from as a street kid in Manhattan.
The mid west and the people of the, prairie will always have a special place in my heart.  			"
"I was taught to play chess when i was five years old.
And i’ve been playing it pretty much ever since.
And, my father taught me.
He was quite a good player.
He should have won the Scottish championship when he was seventeen years old.
Um, which wasn’t a particularly strong championship at the time.
But even so, to nearly be national champion is something.
Um, and i play it to a very good level.
Where i, i play for Oxfordshire.
I play for a team that won the, championship of Oxfordshire.
Um, and, i play it well enough that when the very top players are playing i understand some of what’s going on, though not all of it.
It’s hard to know what its fascination is.
Um, i mean anybody could talk about wh_ what their interest in their spare time- make it, sound interesting.
And it would be interesting cause it’s interesting to them.
But sport has always had, a certain amount of mystique, to people in general.
It, always appears in books or films with, people suddenly saying 'checkmate' out of nowhere.
As if it was a complete mystery to everybody.
And no one knew what was going on.
Which isn’t really how the game is played.
But it shows that people are interested in it.
I play it, because, every game is different.
I play it because, it tests you.
In a way you’re not playing the opponent you’re playing yourself.
You’re dealing with something that is fantastically infractable mathematically.
Where the number of possible games is, as close to infinity as makes no difference.
Where you will never play the same game twice if you play for thousands of times.
And where you’ll probably never play the same game that anybody else has ever played if you play for thousands of times.
Where even the strongest players in the world very often when they play a game, have very little concrete of idea of what’s going on.
And where, it, combines the necessity to calculate.
The necessity to be absolutely clear about what you think is going to happen in the near future.
With a degree of strategy.
A degree of understanding of how you could lay your forces out.
It is comparable to, generals laying out their forces for a battle.
But then i also think that it’s healthy.
However much i’ve got out of it.
When i used to play chess and i used to, tell everybody at work 'oh i’m playing chess tonight.
' And instead of watching Eastenders, or going to the gym, whatever_ i say i'm playing chess.
I’ll come in the next day and they’ll say, 'did you have fun last night.
' And i'd said 'well i never have fun playing chess.
' And they’ll say,'well why do you do it then.
' And i’d laugh.
And after a while it occurred to me it was a very serious and good question.
Why am i doing it, when it’s not fun.
And the answer was, because, very occasionally it gives me satisfaction.
Very occasionally it gives me an intellectual, pleasure, that, I don’t get from anything else.
Uh, the feeling as though i’ve mastered something.
That i've controlled something.
That i’ve managed to grasp something that I had not grasped before.
And, that is so rare that, i do that.
I spend so much time trying to reproduce the feeling.
So i have to keep on playing and so on.
I don’t much like kids playing chess.
I don’t like the way it teaches children to compete against each other with the idea of beating the other.
And proving themselves more clever than the other.
You do find, that among particularly great chess players.
That they’re fantastically nasty as individuals.
They’re extraordinarily arrogant.
They’re extraordinarily small minded.
They don’t understand for instance, that chess actually doesn't matter very much.
And that they do, regard other people as inferior.
Simply because they’re not as good at chess as they are.
They used to say about Bobby Fisher, who is completely deranged.
That he didn’t respect anybody who was not at the_ the_ actually at the top of the tree in their activity.
And if that’s what chess does for you when you live it.
Then it can’t be a particularly good thing.
But just in the same way that there are certain things, like, walking the Ridgeway or, going to the football that i, i get a pleasure from it, i can’t get from anywhere else.
There’s a satisfaction in chess that i cannot imagine myself, getting from any other activity.
And even if that weren’t true, i just can’t give it up."
"Well, i p- play in a band called 'Fluke Style'.
We've been playing, um, in Oxford for, roughly two years.
And, um, its, its_ th- the main about playing live, is that if you do it enough, you get better.
No matter, no matter how low a_ base you start from.
Which is good.
Because we had our_ we did our first gig, um, at a place called Jericho.
Uh, it must have been about two years ago.
And all we had was, um, one acoustic guitar.
And one electric guitar.
We didn't have any bass or drums or keyboards and I couldn't sing.
So i- it was, it was embarrassing.
And the fir_ the first, the first lesson you learn, is not to believe anything anybody says about, how you played when you come off stage.
Whether they're your friends or other people.
Because you'll never, you'll never get an, an honest response.
The most honest response, you could get, from someone, would be, um, not telling you what they thought.
But asking you how it felt to play the gig.
So, 'did you enjoy that.
' That's basically, a code for, 'that was an awful gig.
You should go back to the, you know, go back to the starting point.
'Um, so a- as you improve it is good.
Because yo- you learn, you learn to look out for what might go wrong, at a gig.
And, uh, uh, among the things that can go wrong at a gig, is, basically, if your sound isn't very good.
So you have, you have to make sure_ you have a little th- thing called a sound check, before you start.
And you have to make sure then, that the person who is operating, your sound.
Who's doing all the technical stuff.
Um, knows what you'd like it to sound like_ that you can play okay.
And then, once you actually come to a gig, uh, you shouldn't eat too much.
And, you shouldn't_ definitely shouldn't drink too much.
And the main thing, i think when you get up there, you learn, is to just enjoy it.
And normally, if you enjoy it, it will come across.
And hopefully people will have a good time."
"When I was in college i... Had an English major and for a while I considered going into teaching.
I went through the whole student teaching process.
And... I eventually decided that I didn't want to do that.
And I went in another direction instead.
But while I was exploring the possibility of becoming a teacher, I did a lot of thinking about... The way that the education system in the United States is run.
And... I disagree with a lot of the ways that... Things seem to happen, and have happened for a long time in our educational system.
I can remember when I was in... Junior high and high school, and even as early as elementary school... The way that students would, tend to get boxed in very, early on in their education.
Um... And it becomes really impossible to break out of... The classes that you are more or less tracked into, when you're very young.
And a lot of the decisions... Are made for you really.
Um... People don't seem to recognize various kinds of intelligence, they they seem to just want to... Give standardized tests and... Peg you for... What you are capable of very early on in your education.
And, I think there are a lot of people, who are very intelligent, that I've known personally and... Professionally, have not had a lot of the opportunities they could've had if the school system was more conducive to students... Learning... I- in a little bit less constrained atmosphere.
I've always felt that, a lot of classes that you're forced to take in high school, are not really geared towards what you are going to be doing.
There's there's very little emphasis on, your own special interests.
Uhm... Every body's sort of treated like they're the same person.
Everything is very generalized.
There's a lot of uh... There's a lot of pressure on students to be as well rounded as possible, when I think being well rounded isn't... Really possible because it becomes impossible to develop any one part of yourself, um... To any great degree.
And as a result people can't get into good colleges if they... You know, haven't you know scored the... The right thing on the math section of the S-A-T.
Even if they're brilliant writers, and vice versa.
You know, um.. People just really are not given a chance, I think, in a lot of cases.
And that was something that always really disturbed me, as far as, the way that things are run.
And when I was, when I was getting involved in teaching, I noticed a lot more... That hadn't been apparent to me when I was a student.
And... That had to do with uh... The ways that students are, separated from each other, even.
I, got involved with vocational education, uh, which means that the kids go out to a technical or trade school for part of the week, and then they come back to, the home school for the other part of the week and they take their academic classes.
However these kids are kept separate from the rest of the school almost as if they're, below them.
And they are very aware of their social position.
You know, there's a lot of stratification.
And, the kids are as aware of it as anyone.
Um, at any rate I feel that the kids are, very aware of the way that they're perceived by the... Educators, by their teachers and, you knoww, by their peers.
And I think that it... It causes them to ac,t in a way that... Is... Not really optimal huhu.
But they feel they 're acting in way that they are expected to act.
And,,, that's pretty sad to me.
I I actually had kids tell me when I was teaching them, ""you know, we're the just bad class, we... You know it's not that we have a problem with you personally, you know we're just bad, we're bad kids"" because pretty much that was what they felt they were.
And, you know their classes were very limiting, uh, the teachers never try to do anything creative with those classes, because, you know, they were the bad kids.
They just did dittos all the time and... I i think that m- many of the kids in that class were intelligent, but never actually realized, their potential because of the way they were, tracked very early on in their education."
"Ah recently i started working for a company that puts together books.
And it was, a very revealing thing for me because i was always under the impression that, when books were written, they were written by someone who secludes themselves in a little garret and writes the book.
And then sends it away to a publisher, when he or she has finished with it.
However, it's you know, been a bit disillusioning for me lately because, i'm finding that most books are not written by the person whose name appears on the cover at all.
And in fact, they're a collaborative effort of a lot of people who aren't getting really any credit.
Uh, more or less what happens is a book idea is proposed to a publisher.
It's rarely that they get the finished product and then judge it based on its, existing worth.
Um ... Book producers actually come up with ideas that they think would sell, and they write proposals, and they send them away to publishers, who buy the proposal idea, with the assumption that we're going to get a big name person to, become our vetted author.
And hehe being the vetted author really just means that, you're going to get your name on the cover, and you are going to review the manuscript before it actually sees publication.
However... Chances are you are not going to have a heck of a lot to do with what the content is, and you are not going to have a heck a lot to do with wording.
You're simply going to look at that manuscript when it comes in and, you know maybe cross a few things out, maybe, add a few of your own thoughts.
But the, brunt of the research and the language is put together by, people who are not experts on the subject.
Which i think, is even more frightening because, there are so many psychology books and so many, health books being written out there.
And people are picking them up at book stores with the assumption that, huh, these books have some authority and the people who are writing them... You know, have some accountability for what they are saying.
However that's really not the case you know people see P-H-D on the cover and they assume that all of this is coming straight from... That person's mouth, but, chances are the person who is actually, putting the labor into that book is, you know, an editor, who's a generalist for the most part, and is good with working with language, but not necessarily an expert, on the subject matter.
And it's, it's actually pretty frightening, because some of the ideas that are worked with in the publishing world... Are things that are just geared towards, a population of the people who are interested in the subject, and we're really saying things that we know people want to hear.
Ah, we're asserting a, a plausible connection between things simply because, it's possible.
You know, if you want to find a connection between two things, you can find one.
It doesn't matter if it, if it can actually exist.
I mean it's no an absolute just because, you can back it up with some sort of evidence.
You can, you know, you can construct evidence for anything.
So it's, you know, it's really just all about, what's going to sell.
I mean that's, that's how the companies determine that they are going to, go about pursuing a book idea.
I mean, we've actually, had editorial meetings where we all sit down and... Our president will say... &Quot;ok it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if there's any truth to this.
&Quot; because people will be arguing with him as it's the, the principle that's at stake.
And he's like &quot;it just, it just doesn't matter, you're missing the point.
People will buy this.
&Quot; you know, and, you know, for me it was a real wake up call because i... I was one of those people who just pick books up on the shelf and just... You know assume what i was reading could be backed up by something and, now i'm just starting to realize that books say what i make them say hehehe.
And, and that's pretty much all they say. "
"Once upon a time there was a man and his wife, who were very unhappy because they had no children.
These good people had a window at the back of their house.
And, they would look out the window to a beautiful, beautiful garden.
This garden held beautiful flowers and herbs and, and fruits.
Now they couldn't get to this garden because there was a, uh, there was a huge wall that surrounded it.
This garden also, belonged to a witch, who would put spells on you if she caught you.
The wife would stand at the window, and look at th_ at all the herbs.
And one herb caught her eye.
It was called Grampian.
She liked this cuz it looked so, it looked so perfectly green.
She could envision herself making a nice beautiful salad for dinner, for her and her husband.
So out of this desire, came sickness.
She stared out the window so long that she became sick.
She didn't eat too much, because she desired the, the herb so much.
One day her husband asked, ""what's wrong my darling.""  she said, ""i desire that Grampian so much, to make a, a salad for you and i.""  he said, ""well I shall go get it.""  so that evening he jumped down, out of the window.
Jumped over_ climbed over, the wall and, got lots of Grampian.
He brought it back and, his wife made a beautiful salad, beautiful and tasty as ever.
The salad they ate for dinner for, three nights.
So the following day_ well after the salad had finished, she wanted some more.
And so she asked her husband to go back over the wall, to get some.
So he, he agreed and he, uh, he jumped out of his window and climbed over the wall again.
But this time, he encountered the witch."" aha.
So you dare take my, my Grampian"", the witch exclaimed, ""now in, in repayment for this Grampian, which you may take, again, because as yo- as you said your wife i- your wife is ill if she doesn't have it.
You must bring me your first born child.""  ""first born child.""  he exclaimed, ""but we haven't had a child yet.""  she said, ""oh you will, you will.""  so he went back to his wife, with the Grampian and a couple of mo_ nine months later they had a child.
At that very moment the witch appeared in their home, and said, ""may I have my child now.""  and the wife said, ""what.
My child.""  and the husband looked at her sadly.
Picked up the child, and the witch said, ""hello Rapunzel, you're so beautiful.""  ""Rapunzel.""  the wife said."" she said yes, that's the name of the, of the, herbs that you used to make your salad.
And that your husband pick- took from my garden, so now your child is mine.""  and whoosh they disappeared.
So now, the witch kept their daughter in a tower in the middle of the woods.
This tower had no doors, nor stairs.
As the child, as the child grew up her hair grew longer and longer.
And she grew more beautiful every day.
So to see the_ to see the child the witch would go to to the window, and say, ""Rapunzel Rapunzel, let down your golden hair.""  at that moment Rapunzel would drop down, almost fifty feet of hair, and the witch would climb up to the window_ climb up the tower.
So one day a prince was walking by the tower and he'd hear_ and he heard singing and he stopped and listened to this beautiful singing.
So the next day he was going by again and he wanted to find out who, who the voice belonged to.
For_ the previous day he had seen the witch saying, ""Rapunzel Rapunzel, let down your golden hair.""  so at this time he said the same thing, ""Rapunzel Rapunzel, let down your golden hair,"" and down came, the fifty feet of hair, which he climbed up.
And then he met Rapunzel.
And they fell in love.
So the next day, after, after the prince had left, he came back and, was so in love wi-with Rapunzel that he decided that he wanted to marry her.
So he proposed to her and, she thought she had a better life with him, so she said, ""of course I'll marry you.
But how will I get down from the tower.""  the prince said, ""well I will bring you, a, a foot of, a foot of silk every day.
And you'll make a ladder.
Within a week's time you can you can_ you'll climb down your ladder, get on my horse and I'll take you to my kingdom.
Rapunzel said, ""that's a great idea."" so, each day he visited her, he'd bring her, he'd bring her a foot of silk.
And by the end of the week she had, she had a ladder.
But before the week was over, the witch had climbed up one day.
And, and Rapunzel had made a mistake and said, ""why does it seem you're so much heavier than, than the prince is.""  ""the prince.""  the witch exclaimed."" what prince.
I've tried to protect you from the world all your life.""  and Rapunzel began crying.
The witch said, ""just for this I will ban you even further away from people.""  so the witch sent Rapunzel to a desert.
Where she'd be lonely forever.
At the end of the week the prince came by."" Rapunzel Rapunzel, let down your golden hair.""  and the witch had cutten cut off all of Rapunzel's hair in her anger.
And, she stayed up there.
She stayed in the tower to trick the prince.
She let down the golden hair, and the prince climbed up.
Now the prince wasn't expecting the witch.
So he gasped, at her ugly face.
The witch cried, ""so you're the man who is trying to take my Rapunzel away from me.""  and, he said, ""yes.
Ma'am.
Are you her mother.""  he_ she said, ""no... But... I have a surprise for you.
And he_ and she pushed him out the window.
He fell from the window, and, he fell from the window into vines, which poked his eyes out, and left him blind.
He, he stood up and cried and cried.
Uh, wishing for his Rapunzel to, to be somewhere near.
As he walked through the woods, he eventually found the desert where Rapunzel was.
When Rapunzel, when Rapunzel saw him she dropped to her knees and began to cry.
And so did he.
As her tears fell, one of them touched his hand, and he touched his eyes.
And at the moment he was able to see again.
And he took her to his kingdom and they married and were [lived] happily ever after."
"Once upon a time there was miller.
Now, the miller had favor with the king.
And the king asked, &quot;what do you have to offer.
&Quot; so the miller said, &quot;i have a daughter, who can spin gold, from hay.
&Quot; so the king said, &quot;okay, well how about you show this to me.
&Quot; so... Next day the miller brought his daughter to the king.
And the king placed her in a room, with a big pile of hay.
And said, &quot;spin this gold by the end of the night, or you'll lose your life.
&Quot; so the daughter sat there, weeping and crying, and thinking, &quot;what am i gonna do.
I cannot spin gold.
&Quot; so a couple of minutes later, a little man walked in the door.
The little man said, &quot;what's wrong.
&Quot; the daughter said, &quot;well the king has asked me to spin, spin gold from this hay.
And i cannot do that.
&Quot; so he said, &quot;well i can do it.
What will you give me if i can do it for you.
&Quot; she said, &quot;um.
Well i have nothing much to give, but i can give you a necklace.
&Quot; so she took her necklace off her neck, and she gave it to him.
So he sat there and went vroom vroom, and spin out the a whole wheel of gold.
Next morning the king entered, and said &quot;wow, you span a whole thing of gold, that's amazing.
&Quot; well, she said, um, &quot;can i leave now.
&Quot; he said, &quot;no.
You have to spin this bigger, bigger pile of hay.
&Quot; so she sat there thinking and thinking, and hoping the little man would return.
So in a couple of minutes the little man returned.
And he said &quot;what's wrong.
&Quot; &quot;well i have to spin this bigger, bigger pile of hay.
And i don't know how to do it.
&Quot; so... She asked the man, the little man &quot;could you please do it for me again.
&Quot; and he said &quot;what will you give me this time.
&Quot; &quot;well.
I don't know if i've any more of it left.
But i have a ring on my finger would you like that.
&Quot; and so, he sa_ he said &quot;sure.
&Quot; so he sat down and, vroom, vroom, vroom, ev- even faster.
And, and by the morning time, the hay was all finished and all spun of gold.
The king entered the room, and said &quot;wow.
&Quot; and this time he got a little bit greedier.
And he said_ he gave her even more hay this time.
Bigger, bigger piles of hay to spin more gold.
So in a couple of minutes, the little man returned again, and he asked &quot;do you have the same problem this night, my lady.
&Quot; she said &quot;yes i do.
But i've even bigger and bigger amounts of hay.
Can you do it all.
&Quot; um, he said &quot;sure i could.
But what do you have to offer this time.
&Quot; she said, uh, &quot;nothing.
&Quot; so the little man said, &quot;well how about, when you become queen, you give me your first, uh, son or daughter.
&Quot; the daughter said &quot;sure.
Okay.
&Quot; she couldn't think of anything else to do.
So he spun and spun and spun all night, until it was all finished.
And the next morning, the king took the daughter as his wife so aft- after she bore a child, the little man came into her room and said, &quot;well can i have my child now.
&Quot; and she sat there and cried, and said &quot;no.
I'll give you anything, anything but my child.
&Quot; he said, &quot;well you have three days.
Three whole days to figure out my name.
And, if you can figure it out, on the third day, you can keep your child.
&Quot; so she found a messenger and she sent him out looking and searching and searching for the most unusual names.
And, when he came back, sh- she said, &quot;is your name Casper.
&Quot; he said &quot;no.
&Quot; &quot;Hillard.
&Quot; he said &quot;no.
&Quot; &quot;Skangily.
&Quot; he said &quot;no.
&Quot; on the second day the little man returned, and she had even more extraordinary names.
&Quot;Askaborn.
&Quot; he said, &quot;no,&quot; &quot;Hilleard.
&Quot; he said &quot;no.
&Quot; and she mentioned like five more names.
On the third day, she sent the messenger out and he walked around the woods.
And he heard, he heard a man, a little man, hopping on one leg and crying, &quot;tomorrow i brew, today i bake, and then the child away i'll take.
For little deems my royal dame that Rumpelstiltskin is my name.
&Quot; and he took this back to the, to the queen and said &quot;uh, queen, i have found it, i have found it.
I, i saw a little man and he said Rumpelstiltskin is his name.
&Quot; so when the little man returned, she said &quot;is your name, uh, Harry.
&Quot; he said &quot;no.
&Quot; &quot;John.
&Quot; he said, &quot;no.
&Quot; &quot;Rumpelstiltskin.
&Quot; and he said &quot;what, a demon told you, a demon told you.
&Quot; and she just sat there and smiled in joy.
And he, turned and spun, and spun around, and broke himself in half as he entered the ground ha hahahaha."
"When I was a senior in college I got involved with, our, school literary magazine, which happened to be an art and literary magazine for student and faculty members.
And, it was also open to alumni.
Uh, uh, it was little different than the, literary magazine that had originally existed at our school, which was pretty low in quality.
And, um, there were a lot of people who actually wouldn't submit their work to it because they didn't want it to be seen along side of the things that, were pretty juvenile.
So, in my senior year, a couple of us got together with some professors and we decided to put together this, new literary magazine that would, uh, target a, you know, a broader audience and, you know, hold up a higher standard with, the work that we accepted, and were willing to publish.
And it, it turned out to be something that was quite successful and, I was really proud to be a part of it.
Um... We decided to go with a female theme originally, um, because we felt that it was something that was really lacking in our college community as well.
So... Our, our theme was women in their life span.
But, uh, we didn't exclude men.
In fact, we had many, male students on staff.
And, uh, one of our sponsoring professors was a man.
So... It certainly wasn't limiting in that sense.
Um... And it was also very interesting because we got to, to target a lot of social issues that were, very much swept under the carpe,t um, at our school which tended to be very conservative.
And um... We did a lot with, uh, sexual harassment and... We, um, we tried to... To target different... Different issues that, we felt the other literary magazines weren't even coming close to approaching.
Our previous magazine, really just... Had a lot of... What I think people... Think of as overly dramatic.
Um... The kind of things you may see more in a high school setting.
And, I think that we, we kind of... Stepped things up a bit with... With the magazine that we put out.
And, we wound up winning an award for it, which... Gave us a bigger budget and was really nice.
Uh, after our first year of... Putting it out and, we were able to, to put together a pretty quality publication.
Um... It was a lot of work.
I mean I was, I was going to school full time... While I was working on this and because I was editor-in-chief, I was responsible for... Pretty much everything.
Um... I had the final say on all the submissions and, I also had to just make sure that we made all the deadlines.
I had get the thing to print... When it was, time to send it to print.
And... You know I had to, had to deal with the budget.
I had to figure out... How much everything's gonna cost.
How much we could afford.
I had to work with the art directors, which wasn't always an easy task, because the art directors and, the uh, the editors who were, in charge of the literary end of it didn't always see eye to eye on everything.
And because a lot of the, art, was going to be illustrating some of the writing, we had some political differences huhu.
Which I had to, you know, try to smooth over.
And, in the end we put out something we were really happy with.
Um... And, I actually think that it was working on this magazine that helped me to, to get the job that I have now, that I'm out of college.
Because it is really hard when you, you know when you come from a college setting where you are just doing a lot of academic writing... To... You know, the working world where they want to see, that you can actually make something transfer into... Y-you know, a publishing type setting.
So I think the fact that i, was able to get the whole project off the ground in college... Really helped me, um, it gave me something a little different to put in my portfolio because, other than that it was really just going to be a lot of, uh, the kind of work that, every college student has to show for themselves by the time they finished,  you know, four years in a_ any institution.
So I'm, I'm, I'm pretty happy that i, I was able to do that. "
"One thing i like to do is running.
And i like doing it with, sort of, a club.
What we do is, one person goes out into the countryside.
And they would go the day before and set a trail.
They would just take regular flour, or sometimes flour mixed with a little powdered paint, and lay out  blobs of the  flour to set the trail.
But, it's not just a simple trail.
They put in false trails, which means, you've chosen the wrong way and you have to go back.
And, that helps confuse people, and it also helps keep us together, because sometimes some of the faster runners go out, ahead and take the false trail.
Of course, sometimes the slower runners take the false trail too.
Anyway, eventually, everyone tends to get back to the start.
And it's a lot of fun.
And,it's a good way to get out in the countryside and, see places you wouldn't have seen before.
But i wouldn't recommend it if you're afraid of, things like a little bit of mud or a few thorns. "
"In this lecture, we will talk about Britain in the seventeenth century.
After talking a little, a little bit about Queen Elizabeth I.
We'll then discuss a family called the Stuarts.
The Stuart family.
Firstly we'll talk about James I.
And then his son Charles I.
After that we will talk about Charles I's two sons, who both became king.
Wha_the first one is Charles II, and the second one as James II.
And then we'll talk briefly about Mary, who was James II's daughter.many people see the history of England as the story of the struggle, between the crown, on the one hand.
That's the king or or the queen.
And parliament on the other hand.
In the middle ages the king, the crown, was very powerful, and parliament was very weak.
But slowly,over the centuries the crown lost power, and parliament gained it.
Nowadays, in modern Britain, um, parliament is all-powerful.
And the crown has almost no power, uh, at all, very little.
Elizabeth I, was queen from fifteen fifty-eight to sixteen oh three.
The monarch at that time had a lot of power.
But, could not function successfully without the help of parliament.
And Elizabeth seemed to understand this clearly.
She was very good at getting the help she needed from parliament.
At that time, England was not a powerful country.
The population was only about four or five million people.
And the country was relatively poor.
Spain, then, was by far the richest and most powerful country in Europe.
Spain governed much of South and Central America, and brought, back to Spain every year lots of gold.
The English government, had only a small navy, at that at that time.
But besides those ships there were also a, a lot of English ships that were sort of half merchant ships, and half pirate ships.
Uh, a- a- and these ships, often attacked the Spanish ships, as they were returning from America, with their gold.
Of course it was the gold they wanted.
The king of Spain, Philip II was very angry about this.
He didn't like having, uh, his gold stolen, and his ships attacked.
And he decided he would conquer England.
He built a large fleet, of very big ships, and sent this to attack England.
This is... This fleet is, is called the Armada.
His new fleet of large and very expensive ships, was defeated, by a much smaller fleet of smaller English ships.
And this victory... By the English against the strongest, uh, king in Europe was a very important event for the English.
This was because at that time, um, a feeling of national consciousness was starting to develop in England.
And the victory over the Armada, did much to speed up the development of, of that national consciousness.
Um, for the first time the English started to became aware of themselves as one nation.
Elizabeth died in sixteen-o-three, and she had no children.
The, man in line to be the next king, was a distant relation, called James Stuart.
And James Stuart was already king of Scotland.
His title was James VI of Scotland.
And when he became king of England he became James I, of England.
And the house of Stuart, um, ruled England from sixteen-o-three to sixteen-eighty-nine.
And this was a very difficult period in English history.
Uh, there was, uh, continual struggle between the king and, uh, parliament, and there was indeed a, a war between , uh, the king and parliament.
The problem started with James I.
He was not an Englishman, he was from Scotland.
And in Scotland parliament had very little power.
But in England parliament, had quite a lot of power.
And the parliament in England had, had power because it controlled the king's money.
Uh, James really didn't understand the English political system.
And that caused many probleMs  his son, Charles I, had even less understanding.
Charles I had an argument with parliament, and so he tried to rule, without the help of parliament.
And eventually, this led to a war between the king, and the parliament.
It went on for a number of years, and the king lost.
His head was cut off.
So for a period, Britain had no king.
And the country was ruled for,for most of this time by a man called Oliver Cromwell.
Oliver Cromwell is generally regarded as a very efficient ruler.
But, um... Cromwell died and, after he died things didn't go quite so well.
Hi-  his son took over and wasn't quite so good as his father.
And eventually, parliament, invited Charles I’s son, who was also called Charles.
To come back and be king, of Britain, England and Scotland, as Charles II .
But, with much less power.
That's important.
So Charles came back to England and was king for twenty-five years.
Charles II was not such a good king.
He was rather lazy, and much too interested in enjoying himself.
He's very famous for,um,  going to the theatre having lots of beautiful women around him.
When he died... His brother, James, became king, as James II.
Like his father, Charles I, like his father, James also quarreled with parliament.
But, unlike his father he decided not to fight, and he ran away to France.
James II's daughter was called Mary.
And she was married to the king of Holland.
A a a man called William of Orange.
And in sixteen eighty-nine, after James II had run away to France, parliament invited, William and Mary to become king and queen.
Again the king's power was reduced and parliament's power was increased.
So, this is how during the course of.
Of the seventeenth century the crown lost, uh, a lot of power and parliament gained a lot of power.
Um, there's one thing that, that you must understand, i- i- if you want to understand European history at that time.
And that is religion.
This was especially important in England, uh, during the Stuart period.
Um, about the time of the renaissance, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there was something called the reformation.
It was quite complicated, but to put it very simply, uh, many people rejected the Catholic church and became Protestants.
They were still Christians of course, but Protestants.
And England became a Protestant country, in the sixteenth century.
However, the Church of England was not very radical.
Um, there were other Protestants who were much more radical than the Church of England.
Um, they were called Puritans.
So in a sense the Church of England wa- was about half way between the Catholics on the one hand and the Puritans on the other.
Now at that time, people felt very strongly about religion.
They not only argued wi-with people of other beliefs.
But they actually hated them.
Uh, in Europe many fo_ wars were fought because of differences in religion.
At that time, there were only a few Catholics in England, during the Stuart Period.
And they were generally hated and persecuted.
The king, and the government were Church of England, for most of the time, anyway.
Um, but many people, um, were more radical than this, and these were the Puritans of course.
Now I have portrayed the wars of the seventeenth century a-as a struggle for power between the crown and parliament.
But it was also a struggle over religion.
Many members of the parliament who fought Charles I were Puritans.
And Oliver Cromwell, the man who reigned i-in the king's abs_ or the man who governed in the king's absence, was a Puritan too.
Now the four Stuart kings were technically Protestant, Church of England.
But many people believed that they were secret Catholics.
And many people hated them for that.
We can... Uh, uh, we can also then understand the the wars between parliament and the Stuart kings as being partly, a, a struggle over religion."
"Hi, i'm a student in the... Electrical engineering department and i'm pursuing a P-H-D, in electrical engineering.
My research mainly focuses on the physical properties of magnetic materials.
Um, basically what we do is_ uh, what the experimentalists do is, they cool down these materials to very low temperatures, less than one Kelvin.
And, they're able to... Study the properties of these ma- electrical and... Con- and basically conductivity heat transfer, and, uh... Other related magnetic properties like superconductivity, and so on.
And these are very interesting because, uh, they_ such things were not possible in the sixties and seventies where they they couldn't go to such low temperatures.
And these experiments are revealing very interesting new phenomena not known until now.
S- so as theorists we... Take this data and see if we can make sense out of it, by using, old theories.
Do we have to develop new theories.
And so on.
Um, the way we do it in my research lab is by performing high performance computational, uh... Work.
Basically we model the system, by something simple first and see it that works, to explain the data.
If it doesn't, then we try to take a more complicated model, or maybe change the_ keep the simple model but change it a little bit, and so on.
And, it, uh, takes, it takes sometime to figure out, what is the right model, what are the right quantities.
Are we studying the right quantities.
And so on.
And we really need high performance computational tools to do these kind o, uh, calculations.
Uh, for that purpose we have a powerful parallel processing machine with about four thousand processors.
And these are working all the time, towards my P-H-D."
"With regard to the secondary school education of Chinese-Americans in Boston.
Various statistics demonstrate that this ethnic group actually receives an inferior secondary school education compared to that of the general population.
In fact approximately thirty-eight percent of this ethnic group have not received a high school diploma.
And their poverty rate and incarceration rates are higher than those of other ethnic groups.
And particularly that of whites in this city.
Now, uh, the question is should the U-S government actually intervene.
Or, um, i_ and if s_ if the government do- does int- intervene what measures should actually be int_ undertaken.
First of all, re- regarding the various pros and cons of, uh, intervening.
Well with, ah, can I start again.
I am sorry.
Yes.
Right now.
Try.
Okay.
With regard to the secondary school education of Chinese- Americans in Boston.
Various statistics demonstrate that this ethnic group actually receives an inferior education compared to that of other ethnic groups in this city.
Particularly that of whites in this city.
Uh, now the a_ the question is, is then raised, should the U-S government actually do something about this.
And, if so what measures should be implemented.
First of all with regard to the various, uh, pros of, of intervention.
Intervening can actually increase G-D-P.
For example, if, um, we_ if, uh, Chinese-Americans are, are, i- educated then, then this is going to produce a better skilled work force.
And this could potentially increase G-D-P.
A second advantage is that this could actually then increase savings and investment.
For example if the Chinese-Americans are better educat_ better educated they would then have more disposable income.
And then they, uh, des_ then spend more, more of their money on investing in the U-S economy.
A third advantage of intervention is that this would then enable the United States to better compete economically on an international level.
With a now unified Europe and, a very strong Japan as we enter into the next century.
With regards to the the various cons of, uh, intervention.
There're also, um, various cons.
First of all_ first of all, there's als_ there's the dis_ factor of discrimination.
For example, how can the U-S actually intervene, and actually intervene with regard to one ethnic group.
When the- they're, um, using taxpayer funds from the general population.
The- there's, um, there's argument here for discrimination.
And second argument, is that the United States has limited resources.
And they cannot possibly respond in every such problematic situation.
A third factor is that, uh, from an economic standpoint, market forces could actually correct for such problems in the econ- economy.
In other words, that companies would actually, themselves invest in the education of Chinese-Americans.
So that they would then have a better skilled workforce.
However, studies demonstrate that the con_ for_ as far as the cons are concerned the market has not in_ corrected itself.
Amer_ the americ_ force have not corrected for such problems in, um, in terms of the Ch_ the education of Chinese-Americans.
And, uh, actually that_ from an economic standpoint this would potentially, and actually probably benefit the U-S economy.
Now, now that, uh, we're jus_ now that we've shown what can be gained then.
Ho- how, how ca_ what kind of measures can be undertaken.
Now that is the question.
First of all... We should provide for immediate needs.
By immediate needs i, I mean provide for clothing.
For, uh, ru_ books.
The maintenance of schools and etceteras.
That is the first goal.
Second, we should provide E-S-L classes for the parents.
In fact, um, the_ many of the parents of Chinese-Americans, ma- many of them do not speak, English.
Or, rather do_ spoo_ speak proficient English.
And that inter- interferes with their, um, their participation in the education system of their children.
And, uh, parental participation in their children's education has actually sh_ been shown to be a major factor in the educational success of their children.
So, yes our classes, preferably held at night, would probably benefit the, uh, children as a matter of fact.
Uh, a third thing is that we could, uh, increase, we could increase the standarda_ standardization in the curriculum.
Right now, uh, it is very much up to, the teachers as far as what they teach in the classroom.
So that, one high school diploma earned at one institution, is very different in, in the terms of the education received.
As compared to the, uh, diploma received at a, at another institution even in the same, uh, city.
So that needs to be changed.
So we could standardize curriculum there.
Anoth- another thing is that we can in- increase the, uh, teaching standards.
We can increase teaching standards, and we could possibly provide tutoring for needy students.
Tutoring sessions could, uh, occur during study session.
Which most high schools typically have.
And, uh, these sessions could be held on a daily basis.
An- and at the same time they could also provide the teachers who are teach_ who are seeking a certificate with increased experience.
So, it could be a benefit for both parties.
Now the money for these various proposals could come from a corporate tax increase.
A slight one, however, of approximately two percent.
This would then generate, app- approximately twenty-million dollars in, um_ and, and then, then these propositions could be implemented.
Another thing is that, there could be much more accurate assessment system ri- than we have right now.
And that they curriculum could become more vocation oriented.
Or more practical than it is at present.
And in terms of priorty i, I would place, uh, priority for the immediate needs as being the first.
Second thing we could do as a second step, is starting up the E-S-L classes.
The third thing, in terms of priority, would be the, uh, increase teaching standards and tutoring.
The fourth would be to increase, uh, standardization in the curriculum.
And the fifth would be, uh, to provide a more accurate assessment system.
It is in this order because it's in the order of what would probably take the shortest amount of time.
And what's immediately needed and then wh_ towards, towards what would be_ would take a greater period of time.
So this is what I think should be done.      "
"I’ve been a socialist since i was about thirteen years old.
Roughly about, a month before Margaret Thatcher got elected as Prime Minister.
I don’t know whether it was that particular light, or that particular event that sparked me off.
I have a great aunt who was a socialist for seventy years before she died a couple of years ago.
Um, and she must have influenced me a certain amount.
Um, i’m from a background which, although it would have been affluent if my parents hadn’t split up.
Because my parents did split up.
It wasn’t particularly well off.
And so i have lived, pretty much most my life, and certainly all of my adult life, in conditions where i haven’t had very much money.
And i’ve had all sorts of personal reasons, to ask whether the society we live in is as well arranged as it ought to be.
But, i sup_ mostly i'm Socialist because it strikes me that, inequality is socially dysfunctional.
You can put forward all sorts of... Philosophical arguments, which are perfectly valid.
To say that.
. .  The pursuit of profit is the motor which produces production which makes people set up companies.
And find the best possible products to sell to people.
And that, that means that more of these products get, produced.
And we get rich... As consumers.
And, you can go on like that.
. .  For as often as you like.
You can say that, if people are happy what’s it matter how much money other people have got.
Do they have to be equal to other people, financially before they start, being able to be happy.
Which of course they don’t.
And that is valid as well.
But, wh- whichever way you slice it you cannot get away from the fact that while you have sizable inequalities in society.
People, in the main will feel, that they are not getting as much as they ought to be.
And unhappiness in many ways, is the gap, between what you have and what you perceive you could have.
While you have rich people, then apart from anything else, those people are in our face.
Those people are, always, on television.
They’re in the magazines.
They’re in the newspapers.
They are effectively saying to us, “look at me.
I’m rich.
You could be rich and you’re not, be dissatisfied because what you want to be is to be rich.
&Quot; and while you have that system, that produces dissatisfaction.
Dissatisfaction squeezes out of every pore of an, un- an unequal society.
And it’s bound to be like that.
And it’s also bound to be like because, in order to produce wealth the rest of us have to be squeezed.
The rest of us have to be squeezed of our labour.
To produce, benefits which on the whole_ enjoyed by other people.
And they’re going to be enjoyed by a small number of people.
While most people do the work.
And those people, on the whole, are going to look at the other people and say, 'this is not fair.
' They’re going to look at themselves and say, 'i work hard.
' They say 'i work hard and yet the reward i seem to get is never quite enough.
The work i have to do is always that bit too stressful.
The amount of time i have for myself is never quite sufficient.
' And that’s all because, in a situation where human labour is a commodity.
Obviously they’re going to try and squeeze as much money out of us as they can.
They’re going to try to squeeze as much work out of us as they can.
And as_ work at as high a rate as they possibly can.
And so we feel we’re used.
We feel exploited.
Even if we don’t necessarily, use the term, or think about it an academic or a Marxist sense.
We feel dissatisfied.
As a result, of how we are treated when our labour is commodified.
And i can’t see any way to get out of that.
Other than to have a society which is, to all intents and purposes, equal even if it’s not exactly equal.
So that the exact differences don’t make any difference.
I don’t see any reason in human nature why that’s not possible.
I mean it’s human nature that makes society as it is, so difficult to live with.
Because we aren’t happy with things the way they are.
There’s no reason economically not to have equality.
There’s more than enough for everybody to go around.
There’s no need for anybody to pile any more up.
And yet most of the time you, you know that it’s not going to happen.
You know that the forces that want it not to happen.
The forces that have.
. .  A vested interest in it to not happening_ always going to be strong.
The forces that want it to be_ happen, are always weak and divided.
And you think, it’s, never quite within reach.
The attempts to make it happen always end in disaster.
It always proves too difficult to convince people that things can be done in a significantly different manner to the way they're done today.
And so it always lives in the realm of the imagination rather than reality.
And yet, everything that improves in society happens because someone wasn’t happy with society, the way it is.
And so even if I think of my Socialism as a way_ as something imaginative.
As something unreachable.
It’s worth striving for.
Even if you don’t actually get it.
Because the very matter of striving for it, means that you improve the world you’re actually living in."
"Four years ago, i went to stay on a kibbutz in Israel.
I originally went with a friend, who stayed for two months.
But she had to come back early, 'coz she was back at university.
But i was enjoying it so much, i stayed on for an extra two months.
I was there for, four months altogether.
We arrived in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.
Which was quite frightening, and daunting.
A new language, new atmosphere, the heat.
It was all quite frightening.
But we were collected by someone from the kibbutz.
And taken to our accommodation.
Which was quite nice.
We lived in a caravan.
And we had our own bathroom, and little kitchenette.
Although we were given meals, and our laundry was done.
So we had quite an easy life, really.
We worked very long hours in the fields.
We started work at six o'clock in the morning.
And had breakfast at half past nine.
So it was quite a long wait for breakfast, when you're hungry and tired.
Especially, if you're a bit hung over from the bar, the night before.
I worked in banana fields, and jojoba fields.
There was mainly um, digging work to do.
And we had to pack the bananas when they were ripe enough.
Or, tag the trees, if they were at a certain stage of ripeness, ready to be picked.
Uh, when i was working in the banana fields, i hurt my back.
So i was moved into the kitchen.
Where i worked.
I was mainly washing vegetables, and chopping salad.
Which was quite nice, because i really like cooking.
And it was a really good atmosphere.
And everyone in the kitchen was friendly.
The other volunteers there, were from all over the world.
All different countries.
Mainly Europe.
Um, we all got on really well.
I have a friend in Italy, and France, i still keep in touch with.
And also a friend in South Africa.
So, throughout i've made some really close friends.
That even after this time, we still meet up occasionally, and write to each other, which is nice.
So, maybe one day i'll, i'll go back to a kibbutz.
It was a really good atmosphere, and i really enjoyed it."
"Uh today I got a letter from a friend of mine, who just went away to college for his first year.
And, it was funny.
It was bringing back lots of memories for me.
He just finished going through welcome week where, he was subjected to lots of really awkward ice breakers, with people he just met, and, you know, all sorts of forced bonding activities, with the... The people in his dorm.
And, I was thinking about how when I first went away to college, I was, more or less determined to alienate myself as an act of will, hehe from everyone that I met.
And it, it turned into a pretty, huh, pretty bizarre experience for me.
In my first year I was living on campus at Trenton State College.
And, uh, I pretty much determined after about a week there that, I really didn't like anyone in my entire dorm.
And, huh, rather than you know, behaving in a mature way about this, I decided to make that apparent to everyone and I just kept myself.
I ended up becoming, rather close friends with my roommate.
But, uh, I think we made really obvious that we didn't want to interact with anyone.
And it became almost this elaborate game between us and, the people in our dorm who just thought we were, being really mysterious.
And of course they were all incredibly intrigued by the fact that we didn't want to interact with them.
And... Huh, we were constantly in these, ridiculous feuds with people on our floor over things that really didn't matter.
We were just trying to assert that we were above them by, you know, not wanting anything to do with them.
Every single day, I remember, people would leave notes our message board asking us to go to lunch with them, cuz the whole floor had a habit of eating together.
A whole process that we found to be utterly appalling at the time.
But, every single day we would not show up.
But for some reason they just felt the need to extend the invitation every single day.
And_ I don't know after a while I think it turned into a, it turned into a very entertaining thing for us.
Um, there was you know, there was certain something to that interaction that was, bit_ you know, added, um, I think a good amount of, adolescent melodramatic tension to my life.
And, I think I really enjoyed myself.
But, uh, hehe, but the, the tragic part of it was that, about the three quarters of the way through to the year, I just got kind of bored with it.
And I realized that I had, completely isolated myself from every possible person who, wanted anything to do with me.
And... There was a point at which, my roommate and I both realized this.
And, we just_ we couldn't believe you know, what we had done with our, you know, our potential, uh, personal lives at college.
And, um, i- it was it was really, really kind of sad.
I mean, first year at college you, you don't have a car or anything and you're just stuck with the people, that you live with.
And you're living in this little microcosm of a world where, everything is incredibly out of proportion.
By that time all drama, all the, you know, admittedly self created drama that had been, perpetuated throughout the year was completely out of control.
You know, we had all these very bizarre convoluted situations with everyone that we, had ever interacted with.
And no one knew what to make of us, everybody thought we were just these aliens.
And... It was sad.
It was really a sad experience.
And finally by my sophomore year we wound up moving to a different dorm.
And... There were a few people from our freshman year who, for whatever reason be it the challenge or, haha just complete generic boredom, decided to try to forge these friendships with, with us, regardless of the fact that we had, you know, been through a difficult_ for the entire first year living there.
And some of those people actually became my closest friends for the, you know, the remainder of my college experience.
But it's funny to this day when I talk to some of these people they're just like, ""what were you doing.
What were you doing freshman year.
You know, why were you like that.
I don't understand, you know, what you were doing with yourself.""  and it's funny.
I mean i, I look back on it now and I'm just like, ""man, you know, what was that all about.""  I mean, it's funny because now when I go into a new situation where I don't know anyone, I always have that same, knee jerk reaction somehow where I'm just like ""i don't even wanna have to try, I don't wanna have to try to be friends with these people.
You know, let them come to me, let them come to me"" and, it's kind of a, shoot yourself in the foot kind of, uh, kind of idea, I guess, to live your life by.
Not exactly a productive philosophy but ... It's wierd I mean I just moved to a new town and, uh, you know, I have all these roommates who I don' know from, a hole in the wall really.
We all just kind of randomly got together.
And... I'm finding myself having a lot of flashbacks to freshman year because I'm I'm having some of these old like inclinations rising up.
Where I'm just like, ""ah I just want to be really antisocial, I don't want to deal with these people, I don't want to have to, pretend to socialize.""  and I don't know, I'm just just kind of wondering, you know, wondering if i, can possibly handle myself little bit better this time around than I did the first time around. "
"One of the more interesting stories i have from, uh, my running experience in college involves, uh, one of our training runs.
Um, the college i went to, was... U_, or is up in the mountains, so a lot of our runs, uh, we had to drive out to a mountain and run through the mountain.
Um, and the one time that sticks out the most is, uh, when we were doing a certain workout.
We were running, uh, up the side of the mountain for a mile and then we'd have to run back down and we had to do this five times.
Well, the group that i was in was, uh, lagging behind a little bit, so we were the last few people to get to the top of the mountain.
And, uh, our coach would drive us out there in a van and, uh, he would... Since we the last people to get up to the top he was waiting there for us in the van and he picked some of us up.
So haha if, uh, if you've seen my coach drive then you would understand why this would be a scary experience.
Because the mountain roads, uh,a- are what they called switch backs, which means they just go back and forth to, uh, kind of lessen the strain of going straight up the mountain.
You would just kind of sidewind back and forth to get to the top.
So, there's a lot of turns and a lot of... Really, uh, about pretty much one hundred and eighty degree turns.
Um, so when we're going back down after he picked us up to get back to the school ... Uh, he was, and i also have to tell you that these roads are only wide enough for, a small car.
So the van could only fit_ uh, just barely.
Well, he had a tendency to drive fifty miles a hour down these roads.
And, it's really narrow and it's a gravel road, so the van slides a lot.
Uh, after we made one turn and we're going about forty fifty miles a hour down this uh... Down the side of the road, uh, a car came around the bend.
It was coming straight at us.
Well he_ hehehe he panicked, he hit the brakes, we slid into the side of the mountain and, uh, luck- no one was hurt.
That's why it's a funny story.
But, uh, when he slid into the side of the mountain, um, the back of the van got caught in a ditch.
And, uh, we were stuck on the side, kinda leaning into the mountain side.
And, uh, the other car was fine they didn't get hurt.
Actually, they just kept going on and, uh, laughing at us because we were stuck.
So we only had six people to push the van out.
And we couldn't, because we were stuck on a tree stump.
So our coach, uh, decided to break into a log cabin, that was up on the mountain side, and steal one of their axes.
And we tried to ax down this, this, uh, stump.
Well, when we're trying to ax down the stump, the person, i guess, came back home and, uh, saw that their cabin was broken into, and called the police.
Hahaha and the police had to come up the mountain.
So by the time that we got everything_ we got the van unstuck and we're pulling out, uh, the police were looking around for someone that stole an ax, and broke into a cabin, cuz they didn't know what else he might have stolen.
So we were pulled over and questioned and almost arrested, the, our whole team.
And uh... We had to talk our way out of it.
But that... That turned out to be, uh, instead of a two-hour training run that ended up being, i guess, around eight hours, up in the mountain in the middle of the night, trying to explain to the police that we really didn't break in just to steal money.
We just had to get ourselves stuck out of the, the side of the mountain.
So that's one of my more memorable, uh, college experiences, especially for running."
"In our, in our history course, we studied, among other things, the 1960s in, uh, in America.
Um, and it struck me that the students of today, uh, in comparison, are extremely apathetic, um, about any, sort of issues, and they're not really willing to get involved, on anything.
The one, the one thing that almost became an exception recently, uh, in England was the introduction of tuition fees.
And some students wanted to try and protest against that.
But, um, i, i, I went along to a protest, uh, a f- few months ago.
And i- it was very, very disappointing because there wasn't really, any, passion in it from anyone.
There was, there was a, there was a lady speaking, and then a- a man spoke after her.
And i- it wasn't really a very moving speech at all.
And i- it, it really didn't seem to be, that interested.
That I think it became, not so much a protest but more, sort of a, a, a form of employment while you're a student.
That almost could be something that you could put on your CV for later on, to say that you were a part of.
I don't think they really felt all that strongly about it.
Um, and so i- it, it just seems a shame that, th- th- that students now are more interested in, in what they could personally a- achieve for themselves or, or you know.
To just listen to music going out.
Whatever, they're very much in their own, very much in their own little wo_ in their own little worlds.
There's not much, connection, horizontally amongst students.
There isn't much solidarity.
For anything.
Um, maybe it's just because the issues haven't come up tha- tha- that re-light, a, a students' fire.
But it appears that, the- there could be a very gradual degeneration in, any political situation in the country, or social situation.
And students wi- will just too blind to, to, to really get involved.
Or be a force.
I, i, i, very much doubt the government or the police worry, as much about students as they have done in the past."
"I did my degree in contemporary crafts.
Which sounds rather misleading a_ when you first say crafts.
It's actually, um, like, um, contemporary sculpture using, um, four different materials.
Which are wood, metal, ceramics and textiles.
Um, I studied this in Manchester Metropolitan University, up in Crewe and [xx] faculty.
Um, it sounds_ it wasn't a very exciting place to be a- at all.
Because we were living in Crewe.
But I chose the course because of, the, craftsmanship, and, um, the actual_ th- the style of teaching.
Which was a, a very good course that I wanted to go on.
Um, i_ after the first year I chose_ specialised in, um, textiles and ceramics.
And, um, I preferred these materials rather than wood and metal.
Because, it involved, manipulating things with my hands.
And, um, I wo_ I didn't like, um, using tools to carve, or, to sort of hammer away on a piece of metal.
So... I got on very well with these materials.
And i_ two years later had my degree.
So_ um, and I produced sort of, um, large, um, abstract scale, hanging pieces.
And the ceramics sort o_ was suspended on the wall.
And, um, it was meant to be sort of, for in-interiors and, sort of office space.
Or sort of one-off pieces for inside public buildings and, environments like that.
Um... The exhibition did go down to London.
And, um, it was very well, very well received.
But I was very pleased with my mark.
I got a first, ha."
"Um, i want to talk about_ a little bit about the way_ there_ you know how the course going on in here United States.
And it's_ to me it's so different.
I came from China.
Uh, even in college, all we have to do, in the class is to be a good listener.
You go to the class, you listen whatever it- the professor or the teacher said, and take notes, and that's it.
You go back home, and you, um, do some review before exam or maybe, you know, the da_ haha uh, uh, after class or if you want.
And, um, you know, remembering whatever you learned and that's it_ maybe walk out of the exam you forget everything.
But here, um, from the very beginning, the first_ the first class, you gotta be very active.
You are not only the passive, you know, listener in the class.
You have to be prepared before you go to the class.
You read the material the professor assigned to you.
And you do some research, maybe read the newspaper like, um, for business students, Wall Street Journal,  uh,Fortune Magazine, you know, um and take some notes from the_ from the articles you've read, about the topics, like finance, uh, like taxation and, you have to talk in the class.
And you, um_ many_ many of the professor, they have like grades about the participation in class.
Like we have a class_ there's thirty percent of the grades is from participation.
So you cannot just keep quiet and take notes, from whatever, everybody else said.
You have to, you know, speak out yourself, your opinion.
It's very interesting.
One of our professor said, &quot;you know, i don't want to listen to you, like i agree with somebod- someone else_ i agree_ i don't agree.
I want to_  i want to listen what's your opinion about the whole thing.
&Quot; so, um, um many of_ that's_ that's very different for me_ it's, it's very different.
And sometimes can be very difficult too, cuz you are not used to speak, like public speak, presented in the front of, you know, so many people.
Maybe not too many, um, in terms of our class in China we have maybe a hundred people to go to the same class here.
In our school the class size is relatively small.
We have maybe, twenty five is at the maximum.
Or the small- smallest class i ever went to, was, um, nine people_ we have nine people.
But still you got do a lot of group study, and, uh, group, um, presentation.
You got to know how to work together with other people.
And, uh, in terms of the structure of the class, um, you may have, you know, fifty percent of the grades from the ex- exam from the written test, uh, another fifty percent_ they're from the participation like pres- presentation or, from, uh, from the, uh, paper_ papers.
You have to do a lot of research, and i think that's most different thing.
I think the way they, um, teach here is much more better than, just to be a listener in the class.
Cuz, you are more active.
You not only learn something from the textbook, you also learn from the, uh, current issues_ current, uh, situations.
So you_ you remember everything.
Um, you even up to maybe, one year, two year, five years later you still remembering,&quot;oh, that's the case, that's the thing we talk about in class.
&Quot; you_ you maybe forget the terms, the terminology's you learn in_ from accounting or finance class.
But you know what people are talking about.
What the whole thing_ what the implication, of this, and you understand.
I think that is the whole point about_  as you get a higher degree or you know higher education."
"I got interested in the question of, uh, sport.
And what’s a sport and what’s not a sport.
Probably because, as someone who’s always been interested and fascinated by sport and talked about it a lot.
I’m also a chess player.
And I always felt, that, for me chess was a sport and, um, it certainly was the way I played it.
Um, and it’s_ if you wanted to define sport, you were gonna have to do so in such a way that I felt would take in chess, rather than excluding it.
Which most people do necessarily by saying, 'well sport has to be something, physical.
'But I started to think, 'well why, do we call something sports.
And why do we not call something sports.
' And I’ve reacted very much against, some people saying, 'well there’s sports and there’s games.
And chess is a game because_' no, um, Scrabble is a game.
And, um, backgammon is a game.
But chess is something, bigger than that.
More important than that.
You know who the world chess champion is.
He’s a sort of famous person and probably a few others.
Whereas, you can’t tell me who the world Scrabble champion is or the world backgammon champion.
And yet at the same time I wanted to get a couple of things off my chest, about things that had crept into the sporting world.
Like ice dancing, and so on.
And, the, the women’s floor exercise in gymnastics.
Which seem to be far more about, looking good, and creating an aesthetically pleasing impression.
Rather than actually competing against each other.
Which_ it has to be somewhere at the centre of sport.
And so what I asked myself is, 'what do things that I think are sport have in common, that things I think are not sport do not have in common.
' And I decided that, that sport was something that develops socially.
Something that’s a sport now might not have been a sport in the past.
Football, for instance which is absolutely epitome of what you’ll think of as a sport now.
Um, was nothing of the sort.
You know two hundred years ago it was, a, a game that people played in schools or that, uh, people kicked, uh, some sort of pigs bladder about in a village in some ancient game or other.
But it wasn’t what we would now think of as sport.
Sport at the time, pretty much meant horse racing.
Or hunting.
Or anything with horses.
Now_ so what I thought is, 'sports are things that developed out of games.
Games which are competitive.
Games where the aim is to, beat somebody at something, on an agreed set of rules.
' And so you had to have an agreed set of rules to be a sport.
But for the game to become sufficiently important, so there is this agreed set of rules.
So that you know what it actually is.
You can actually define it.
Where it’s taken sufficiently seriously for there to be spectator events.
For people to go and see it.
For people to want to see it played as well as it possibly can be played.
And therefore, for there to be something which is, either, a layer of professionals.
People who actually do it for a living.
Or people who effectively do it for a living who... Will do it and get, time off work to do it if they have to.
People do it in all their spare time and so on.
And who’ll do that because they’re the best and people’ll come and see them.
Now that applies to, football.
It applies to table tennis.
It also applies to chess.
Chess is sufficiently culturally important, uh, for it to qualify.
It wouldn’t apply to, the floor exercise in gymnastics for instance.
Because although people go and see it.
And although, it, does derive from the games people play.
Um, it simply, is not competitive in the un_ in the way I understand competitive.
It’s not like saying, 'i like this picture rather than another picture.
'In a way pictures compete against each other.
In a way gardens compete against each other.
To say who’s going to, who’s going who’s going to like the most.
Who’s going to say the most nice things about them.
But that’s not what I think of as sporting competition.
You have to compete, in a set of rules, in which it’s clear to everybody who can win and who ca_ not can win.
And where you have this bizarre situation of people sitting around at the end of, a- an ice skating competition, not knowing who’s won, because the judges have to decide, that’s not a sport to me.
If nobody’s won, so that I can see who’s won and who hasn’t.
It’s not a sport.
And that means that ice dancing is not a sport."
"Um, i- in this lecture i want to talk about, the expansion of United States, um, the nineteenth century expansion westward.
Let me begin, by, reading a quotation from the American Declaration of Independence which was issued in seventeen seventy-six.
'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they a- are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
' Wonderful words.
But for me, the irony o- of the United States is that such words could be written by people who owned slaves.
People who bought and sold other people, and continued to do so after issuing the Declaration of Independence.
That a country founded on such, wo- wonderful principles could have expanded and conducted itself i- in such, um, spectacular violation of these principles.
The establishment... Of, uh, colonies in the new world in South and Central American, um, was a major event in in human history.
When the first Europeans went to America, in the late fifteenth century, of course they didn't discover it, there were already twenty or perhaps forty million people living there.
We're not sure exactly.
Um, South a-American and Central American had, um, large populations, large towns and, uh, well developed economies.
They were quite rich.
And the Europeans [throat clear] e- especially the Spanish and the Portuguese went there, and conquered these countries.
Stole much of their wealth, and of course many people were killed, um, by the conquering Europeans, and of course many d- died of the diseases they brought.
Um, the population of North America was much smaller than that of South and Central America.
We don't know exactly how many people were living there of course.
But it was possibly about five million people.
These people are often referred to as Indians.
A- although nowadays i- its more politically correct to call them native Americans.
The native Americans, uh, gener- in North America anyway, generally led quite simple lives.
Um, there were many different groups, of them.
And some of them were farmers, and some of them were hunters.
Some lived in, um, small villages, uh, there were some small towns.
And others lived i- in small groups in the forest.
Um, the first European settlers went to North America, in the seventeenth century.
Um, usually the native Americans there treated the new settlers as neighbours.
Um, often they helped them.
And there are many many famous stories about, uh, uh, groups not...Surviving their first year of, uh, living in the United States_ living in, uh, North American, um, without help from the Indians.
But_ however as more and more European settlers came to North America, relations between the settlers and the native, a- Americans often became very bad.
And in, in many places, uh, wars developed between them.
Probably the most important cause of these bad relations between the settlers - and the native Americans.
Um, was the fact that both groups had very different ideas, about the ownership of land.
Um, many, uh, north American Indians did not believe in the individual ownership of land.
They believed that the land belonged to everyone, and you couldn't own it.
Um, this may seem like a strange belief, um, to many of us.
Uh, but in actual fact it's not, such as strange belief at all.
And we_ we meaning, um... Um, uh, most Europeans or amer_ uh, North Americans anyway.
And, we hold a similar idea a- about the sea.
And, we think that no-one owns the sea, it belongs to everyone.
And uh_ and so many north American Indians considered th- the land in the same way as we consider the sea.
Th-that it's, uh, no one can own it.
The settlers of course wanted to take the land for themselves.
They had, uh, European ideas about land ownership.
And, n- not only did they want to take the land, they wanted to take a lot of land.
In fact they wanted to take it all.
And... There we- were other problems too.
Uh, many of the, uh, settlers from Europe, um, considered the native Americans as inferior people.
And, many of them even thought they were perhaps not real human beings.
Um, when the thirteen colonies were established on the Atlantic coast.
Uh, th- the thirteen British colonies, uh, many of the native Americans were killed by the British and  other European colonists.
Uh, but then when the United States became an independent country i- in seventeen eighty-three.
And, the British government as part of the settlement, uh, that established the country gave them, um, or granted to them th_ a large area of land to the west of the colonies.
Of course this large area of land had very few white people, uh, Europeans living in it.
Most of the people were living there_  uh, who were living there were Indians.
And you could re- reasonably ask how come the British felt they had the right to give away other peoples lands.
But, um... Anyway this uh_ what happened was thatl- l- lots of Europeans or people of_ white people shall we call them, started to move west.
Uh, uh, and they wanted land to start their own farMs  and, during the period from... The problem with that of course i- i- is, um, as the settlers moved west and moved onto the land a- a- and took the land for themselves, the native Americans really had a choice.
They could either resist this, fight, or they could leave.
And, um, some left and some fought but... During this period f- from_ the period from about seventeen-eighty to eighteen-eighty the United States expanded from th- the small area on the eastern Atlantic coast.
And expanded to cover the whole of North America.
Um, of course south of Canada a- and north of Mexico.
They expanded all the way to the Pacific coast.
This was a huge area.
And... We're entitled to ask what happened to the native a- a- Americans living in this large area.
Well, it's a terrible story.
Um, at first the United States government made agreements with, uh, many of these native Americans.
A- and the agreement said that they could continue to live on their land, and so on and so forth.
But most of the promises, um, were broken by both the settlers of course.
Th- the settlers moved west just grabbing more land.
And often ignoring, uh, the government.
And the promises were also broken by the government itself.
And, uh, there were many wars of course.
A- and many native Americans were killed.
Uh, just to give an example, between eighteen_ in about eighteen-fifty there were a- approximately a hundred thousand, native, uh, a- Americans, American Indians living in California.
Ten years later, in eighteen sixty there were only thirty-five thousand.
The population had dropped to one third, a- approximately one third of what it was before.
Um... Th-  the government, uh, of course tried to stop the fighting between the Indians, uh, uh, by moving the Indians away, to special areas of land called reservations.
Of course the revel- the reservations were usually on very poor land.
And land which the settlers didn't want.
And, uh, and of course, many of the native Americans did not want to live like prisoners i- in some strange, uh, land_ useless land.
And many of them tried to avoid being taken away from their homes in this way.
There is one tragic story_ uh, in eighteen-seventy-seven one group of, uh, native American set of_ and they set off to walk two thousand five hundred kilometers, to the Canadian border.
To try and escape to Canada, to avoid being moved to a reservation.
And tragically they were captured only, about forty kilometers from the border.
Um, there is, uh, plenty of evidence, um... That the United States government continually broke its promises, to the native Americans.
And, a- and President Hayes, he was president of the United States.
And, uh, he is quoted as saying that, uh,  &quot;many, if not most of our Indian wars have had their origin in broken promises, and acts of injustice on our part.
&Quot; in other words he admitted basically that the settle_ settlers and the government were bad.
There are many many terrible stories, about how the native Americans were treated.
In eighteen-sixty-four for example a group of soldiers, attacked a peaceful Indian village in Sand Creek, Colorado.
And, three hundred men, women and children were murdered and scalped.
Scalped by the American soldiers.
Scalped means cutting off the top o- of the head, the scalp on the top of the head, as a souvenir.
Um, the officer who was in charge of the soldiers, um, is reported to have told his men, before they attacked, &quot;kill and scalp all, big and little.
&Quot; in other words even the children.
Um,of course, uh, uh, many of the native Americans decided to fight and defend their land against the settlers who came to steal it.
And, uh, there are many stories about this.
Uh, a- and the native Americans did have some victories.
Some very famous victories.
But, inevitably they lost and they were taken away to reservations and_ where they usually died of disease and alcoholism and, uh, such probleMs the e- e- Native American Indians were killed by the soldiers of the U-S Army, of course.
But, it wasn't so much ther_ but, it was really the railways that, um, defeated the Indians.
From about eighteen-sixty, um, railways started to be built across the United States.
And soon there was a network of lines running to any_ every area of the country.
In thus in the fight between the Native Americans and the U-S government soldiers the government could send its soldiers, by train very very quickly to any place it wanted.
The last battle that took place between the Indians and the U-S soldiers was in eighteen-ninety.
At a place, uh, called Wounded Knee, where a hundred and seventy native Americans were killed.
And, it's worth noting that, most most of these were killed from behind while they were trying to run away.
I mean this is murder of course.
Um, when Columbus went to America, in fourteen-ninety-two there were probably about five million Native Americans living in the land, tha- that became the United States.
Um, by the, uh, nineteen-hundreds probably the population of native Americans living in the United States, was, probably somewhere about two hundred and thirty thousand.
Um, a terrible story indeed. "
"On the way_ coming home from Israel, some years ago, i was offered the option of a direct route, or a stopover in Amsterdam.
And i was anxious to see the Anne Frank museum, ever since the Second World War.
And here was my opportunity because it's in Amsterdam, in Holland.
And, in the country of Holland.
And, um, i went there.
I found Holland_ Amsterdam very comfortable because they speak English.
It's very much like America.
I was at home.
Now i got up to the Amsterdam muse- to the, to the Amsterdam_ to the Anne Frank museum.
And, i wa- i was shocked.
This is the museum_ this is the building where she was, hidden.
Where she and her family were hidden.
And they take you up to those actual rooMs  that's where the museum is.
Showing you everything, that Anne Frank went through.
That part was bad enough, because i had read the books and i knew what was there.
But the, part that bothered me the most, is on the wall as you walk out of the Anne Frank museum.
And maybe coming in, i didn't notice it coming in.
But the people going to the gas chambers are walking with you.
Looking at you, talking to you.
They're the same size you are.
You get to feel as though you were there with them.
Not them with you, but you with them.
The only thing that isn't real about it, is it's all grays and black and white.
But you forget that so soon.
You are so sure that there__ that you are there with them.
I walked out of the place, very shook up.
Then when i got home, we got involved in the local_ Spring Valley, the Jewish center of our community was building a mem- a memorial museum.
A holocaust museum, they call it.
And it was to be attached to the public library, and it was open to the public, free.
And i was involved in, in the preparations and the planning.
I was writing newspaper articles for it and so on.
So, of course they said, &quot;why don't you go in and see the museum&quot;.
And i said, &quot;i don't want to.
&Quot; i had seen one, one, one was enough.
The answer was, &quot;but, Shirley, you were involved, go see the museum.
&Quot; and there they were again, walking into the museum.
Coming up the steps into the museum.
That sa-that same parade out there.
And it's very shaking.
Then when i got home my daughter came back  from Washington D-C with this wonderful discovery, &quot;ma, you must see the Holocaust museum in Washington D-C, absolutely must go.
&Quot; &quot;i'm not interested, i don't want to go.
I don't want to see.
I don't want to know anything about it.
&Quot; and this time i won.
I know that, that chairs of  holocaust studies were created in colleges.
The departments, to teach this, there's Lucy Dawidowicz did a lot of writing.
I read all her stuff.
I read a lot of that stuff.
But i just_ i know a lot of people who came back from there, and i don't want to know any more about it.
I i'm finished."
"I would like to say a few words about, uh, the Bhagavad Gita.
It is probably the most... Important of the h- Hindu philosophical texts.
It is of course part of, uh, even bigger epic The Mahabarata, the war between two... Clans of... The, clans of warriors who were fighting for ge- getting the same kingdom.
So the setting of Bhagavad Gita is that, Arjuna the great archer on one side... At the verge of the war suddenly decides, uh, decides that on the enemy camp he has his own cousins, elders, teachers.
And, he shouldn't, go on war with them and kill his own, family in some sense.
So, Krishna takes this as an opportunity to instruct, Arjuna about what he should be doing, what his duty is.
And also to tell the rest of the world, what life is all about.
So that's the context of Bhagavad Gita.
Uh ,the interesting thing about the book is, that the book itself is, uh, quite removed from the context, except for the first chapter where it's... Described.
And, also from the religious aspects of Hinduism.
So that, one can read Bhagavad-Gita for its philosophical content itself without being too bothered about the, religion, especially for people who don't belong to Hinduism.
Uh, i've been reading this book, uh, over, the last two years.
So- slowly chapter by chapter.
And sometimes I have discussions with some of, my friends, especially those who are not Hindus and not familiar with those ideas.
And recently I found that... One of my friends who is very interested in Taoism and, that_ th- there's many aspects are very similar, even though the... Uh, way it is said and the, language is different.
The philosophical content of tao- Taoism, basically Lao-Tzu's book, and... Bhagavad Gita are very si- related.
And... I wouldn't be surprised if there was some exchange between India and China of these philosophical aspects in anc- ancient times that made this similarity possible."
"One of the experiences which i remember, from visiting Hawaii last year, was when i visited some freshwater pools.
In order to get to, these pools you have to travel, through jungle, uh, over bumpy roads, up and down some hills, through more jungle and ti_ until, finally you reach the spot and it doesn't look like a, particularly special spot.
But there is somewhere to put the car.
You get out and you... Follow the trail.
So you walk through the jungle.
There is thick, thick trees and plants hanging down and vines, and, you got to walk through this trail over rocks and, up some more hills, or down some hills.
And then finally the, the jungle clears.
And you come to this beautiful clear... Pool of water.
And the one which i went to, on the far side had this incredible waterfall coming down.
It was a small waterfall maybe, four feet tall.
But the water was just thundering down out of it, because the water came out of a small opening, and just, burst with so much pressure.
Even though it was shortly, before five feet.
It was just thundering down, this four or five feet.
Like an enormous natural faucet just pouring down into this pool of water.
And all the water was so clear, and there were, several people there already, swimming or jumping into the water or just sitting beside it, enjoying the scenery, which was just incredible with the... Jungle plants and trees and vines which went right up to the water.
So, um, one of the things which you could do was climb up, the cliffs, or climb up the side of the, um, hills beside the water.
Climb up to where you were maybe thirty or forty feet up from the water.
I wasn't that brave, i only went, ten feet above the water.
And then just jump into the water.
And you could just go deep deep down into the water, you didn't have to worry about how high you climbed, because the water was so deep, that you could just plunge into it and go... Twenty or, you know, thirty feet into the water.
Because i only went ten feet above the water, i maybe only went ten feet or five feet into the water.
But it was still really incredible.
It was very exhilarating just to jump off the land and, go straight into this water.
And one of the things i saw was, two people standing way up on the highest... Cliff that there was.
Maybe, i don't know, forty or fifty feet, very very very high.
You had to be very brave to jump off of there.
And what i saw was a man, and his daughter, so it was a father and a daughter, and they are both standing, right on the edge of this cliff, with their knees bent, their body crouched, staring over the cliff.
Just staring down at how far they wanted to jump, how far that they were just going to fall through the air, and hit the water and... Go into it.
And they both just stood there, half terrified and half exhilarated, half excited to, think that they might try this.
And they just stood there almost frozen in this, crouched position.
Until finally after i think maybe ten minutes, it was a very very long time where they were, standing, thinking and contemplating, about what they were, going to do.
Until finally one of them jumped first.
And so who do you think jumped first.
Was it the older father, or was it the younger daughter.
It was the younger daughter.
So she finally got the, the courage and bravery first.
And she just suddenly jumped, her her legs s- you know,sprung herself forward, two or three feet, up and outwards, into the air.
And her arms were waving in the air, and her feet held up crouched against her body.
And she just sh- almost smashed, just plunged, just hit the water.
And, uh, all this water came flying into the air and, her body must've gone so deep and far into the water.
And when the father saw this, you could see him turn his head, and then watch her go down.
And then he knew, well that was it he had to it.
He couldn't let his daughter do it and, him not do it, and have to walk down the cliff.
He knew he had to jump.
So when he saw her do that , when she hit the water, then next moment, he just jumped.
Uh, almost out of, um, a sort of a_ i don't know it's not peer pressure because it was his daughter.
But just almost out of... Keeping respect in the family that if his daughter did it, he had to do it.
So, then his, uh, big body went flying out and up into the air, and arms waving and, legs crouched up into his chest, and, he hit the water with even more force.
And even more water went up into a, great plume.
And it was really fantastic to see this in this beautiful setting.
It was, it was a pretty interesting story."
"I think that, i'm, uh, only half serious when i say that i am my own favorite author.
I like the things i have written even after having spent a lot of time editing them.
One, is a short novel called <em>Lyrics</em>.
It has to do, with a Russian-American physicist, who loses his work, after the Americans have successfully landed on the moon.
NASA fires... Scientists by the thousands, by the hundreds, when that task is over.
And he is one of these people_ he is, to some extent, neurotically attached to his wife.
Who is kidding him that he can't get work.
And so he just grabs the first thing he can get.
He gets a job as a garbage man, a sanitation man, for the New York Department of Sanitation.
And that is what he does.
And the_ the joke that is running throughout the book, is about his life, and how he deals with other people, working with him.
And... His wife um has a breakdown.
He has somebody else though.
He_ he has a young woman who is his mistress.
And... Things go from bad to worse.
But... At any rate, i am very pleased that i got that thing done.ma- maybe more to the point would be, one of the short stories i have written.
One is called, &quot;Angel's Wine.
&Quot; it's a story of an angel, who gets mugged, in, uh, in the Schubert alley in New York_ in New York City.
Yeah this_ this is easier to deal with.
Um, he meets a young man who is blind at the end of Schubert Alley.
He himself does not know what is happening.
He himself, the angel was mugged.
He was hit on the head, and he has amnesia.
He doesn't know much of what... He came from.
Anyway he takes pity on this young blind student.
And cures his blindness.
And in vast gratitude the young guy brings the, angel by cab to his own apartment in West Sixty-Six Street.
Which is beautiful he didn't expect a beggar, a public singer, a street singer to have such a lovel- lovely apartment.
Well the, musician plies the angel with drinks.
He first tries to make for him a, um, martini.
And it goes on from there to drugs, and so forth.
And the angel, is very, patient.
But he knows he can't do much about that.
At any rate, um, it's the story of an angel who is demoted to prophet.
He, suddenly feels a terrible, withdrawal spasm.
So he no longer feels himself to be an angel working miracles, powerful and mortal.
All he has is a withering_ a_ a_ a, um, wrinkling black body that might soon die.
But then he realizes that he is a prophet.
And it some_ makes sense, if, if you read it more than what i am describing it.
&Quot;Angel's Wine.
&Quot; the angels themselves, have a great time after singing, and looking at the face of God, and all that.
They, um, the best thing they can do, is to drink the tears of human penitence.
That's wine to all the angels.
You see.
Um, and that's enough."
"I've written a couple of novels.
Um, both unpublished.
Both destined to remain that way, for the foreseeable future.
The first one is, uh, science fiction, fantasy.
Um, which evolved into more fantasy, than science fiction.
And i think, if i rewrite it again, the, science fiction element will be completely removed.
And it will be psychological fantasy.
Um, about, a dead person, and the effect that their, funeral, that they've planned for, has on the lives of everyone around them.
Pretty depressing thing to write in the summer.
So, i'm definitely not working on that at the moment.
Um, the other one, is, about, hm, no it's not really about.
The other one is, a modern, reworking of <em>Snow White</em>.
I read a very interesting book, by Marina Warner, about, fairy tale and folklore, called, <em>The Beast and the Blonde</em> [<em>From the Beast to the Blonde</em>].
And one of the things that she pointed out, was that, the stepmother, which is the wicked stepmother character, in English fairy tales.
Is a- a translation from, the French, belle-mere, which also means grandmother in French.
I understand, you may know, better than me.
Um, and, if you- all_ no, mother-in-law, that's it.
It's mother-in-law.
And so, you can reread the stories as_ not as a young girl who has a new old woman, coming into her home to have authority over her.
But you can retell all of the stories, as, um, a young girl, moving into her husband's house.
And having to cope with the, power dynamic, with the old woman who is used to having power in that house.
Whose power will eventually fade as she gets older and weaker.
And the new young wife, obviously, has to take over the reigns of the house.
And i think that makes all of the stories, suddenly, very much more interesting.
And, um, i thought i'd like to do something with that.
So, i've been playing around with various ways of doing it.
And, i expect i'll continue to play around with various ways of doing it.
The one i've got at the moment seems quite nice.
But, since it involves, a brother and sister pair, and the brother's girlfriend coming in_ and my brother's just about to get married.
I thought i might leave it for a little bit, to be tactful, in case, my new sister-in-law thought it was something to do with her.
Ha ha."
"Probably remember our miners' strike.
The miners were on strike in, Britain between, March of nineteen eighty-four and March of nineteen eighty-five.
In what was the longest industrial dispute of any size, ever seen in this country.
And it had implications across the world.
It had support across the world.
And at most it had implications because it lost.
And it lost completely.
And we knew at the time, what a difference this would make.
Because, the whole future of the politics, and of the labour movement, in Britain depended on it.
It happened because they were closing down.
. .  A lot of mines.
They’d been closing down mines for, for decades.
But finally the National Union of Mineworkers had decided that it was going to draw a line and say that it was no longer happy with pit closures.
They closed a couple of pits.
They closed one called (Palmaze) in Scotland.
And one called Coughtonwood in Yorkshire.
And the miners from those pits... Went and picketed the boys in other pits.
And insisted that they come out in their support.
And the strike kicked off.
It was a very violent strike.
It was a very bitter strike.
About fifteen people died, during the course of the dispute.
Many thousands of people were arrested.
Hundreds of people were injured.
The press, and the.
. .  Television mentioned nothing but the violence, for twelve months.
It was_ and as far as they were concerned, all it was was a, bunch of thugs and hooligans who were trying to, overthrow civilized society.
I was at Oxford university at the time.
Um, the contrast between a miners strike and Oxford university is so great.
That it’s difficult to exaggerate.
On the one hand you had this ancient, educational institution with, it’s punts and it’s spires and it’s, tutorials on the grass.
On the other hand you had a real industrial dispute.
All about people working down mines.
And about people being hit by the police.
And people hitting back.
And i could tell at the time.
. .  That in a way it was a battle between those two worlds.
It was a battle between, the world where you had to struggle.
And the world where you never had to struggle.
It was a battle between.
. .  The people who were complacent, and people who had never had the opportunity or the means to be complacent.
And so for twelve months i collected money for them.
I stood out on pavements collecting money for them.
We sent, food parcels to se- to Yorkshire and to South Wales.
We went to demonstrations.
We went to picket lines.
We went_ we have a power station near Oxford called Didcot which we tried to close down by picketing and failed.
And as the strike wore on and it got harder and harder.
It became more and more obvious, that we were going to lose it.
And when we did lose the miners' strike.
What happened was that left-wing politics in Britain almost disappeared completely for a decade and a half.
Because, the whole feeling of the labour movement that people were supporting.
Was that they were never, ever going to go through that again and lose.
Unless_ you can’t go through that again and be sure you could win.
They therefore weren’t ever going to do it again.
And the trade unions declined.
And the left-wing of the Labour Party disappeared.
And.
. .  One of the consequences is the Prime Minister, Mr  Tony Blair, who is also Labour Party but doesn’t, look like he’s from the Labour Party.
Doesn’t sound like he’s from the Labour Party.
Doesn’t sound likes he’s got any interest in the Labour Party.
Or knowledge of it.
And if English politics seem particularly, bloodless.
And if they seem to have a little, less than nothing to say about social justice.
And if people seem to be dissatisfied with the way they are.
But don’t seem to have any way of dealing with it, or any alternative to offer.
It’s probably because fifteen years ago, our most important trade union spent a year fighting a strike and lost it.
And we’re still living in the shadow of that loss.
And we haven’t recovered from it."
"A few weeks ago in my parish church newsletter.
Um, which is a Roman Catholic Church here in Oxford.
Uh, it was announced that the parish priest was, um, being moved, uh, at the end of the summer to another, parish.
And that, the priest who would then be in charge, was our assistant priest who is also, um, an assistant chaplain in the university.
Um, and also does a lot of retreats as a retreat director.
What is interesting about this, is the fact that he is a married priest.
A married Roman Catholic priest.
He, um, had originally been, uh, an Anglican priest.
And, um, became a Catholic some years ago.
And worked as a, lay person in the church.
And also as a spiritual director for some years before he was allowed to be ordained.
Um, he’s actually a, a younger man than many of the Catholic priests that were ordained, and has a family.
And, um, so this is quite a, um, a novel experience for a parish.
Having a married priest in charge.
Because quite often they are assistant priests or, um, chaplains or, re- retreat directors.
Um, all of which this particular priest is.
But, um, from the end of the summer his other duties will be, uh, taken from him 'cause he won’t have time to do it.
As he’ll be in charge of a very big parish with several mass centres in it.
Um, and he will be in charge, along with a deacon.
And the deacon is also married.
Um, what we call a permanent married deacon.
So we will have two married men running the parish.
Which i think will be a very healthy thing, for our parish.
And for the church.
And this is beginning to happen more and more.
People aren’t actually always aware of this.
That we do have married priests in the Catholic church.
And, perhaps it’s a more recent thing in the western Catholic church.
But in the eastern Catholic church which is all part of the Catholic tradition.
They have always had married and, uh, celibate clergy working side by side.
Very similar to the Orthodox church.
So throughout Eastern Europe, um, all the different rites you have like Marionite and, Byzantine rite.
And, i think there are about a half a dozen different rites, for the different eastern Catholic traditions.
They have always had a married clergy.
And even in the western church, which people aren’t always aware of.
It was only in the twelfth century, that it became church law, can- what we call canon law, that priests were not allowed to marry.
Um, in practice there weren’t that many around by the twelfth century perhaps, um, for various reasons.
Because of inheritance laws and, uh, other more practical regulations like that.
Um, but in the early church, um, there had always been a married clergy.
And, um, if you go back to your gospels of course, Peter himself was married.
Hehe.
Um, so maybe one day we’ll get a married pope.
Aga- again.
Because, um, in the Roman Catholic tradition we always look on Peter as being the first pope.
Um, and so anyway i think this is, uh, a very exciting innovation that we’re going to have in our parish.
And it is actually something that is beginning to happen more and more, um, in this country.
And has actually for the last twenty years been happening in other countries.
Like in Australia and, um, Canada, and New Zealand.
Um, and i think that, um, a married, a married man with his wife and family can only enrich, um, their local community.
And also too the fact of, um, the priest’s wife being, engaged in perhaps some of the, responsibilities of, running the parish.
Or assisting in there will, um, perhaps pave the way for, seeing women in a different light.
And the revival of women deacons.
Which is something which has been talked about quite a bit in this country.
In fact our Cardinal, Hume has talked about this, um, fairly recently.
And so have other, leading clergy.
Because you have the tradition of women deacons there, right through the early centuries.
And who knows with_ um, once we get women deacons, um, maybe then we’ll even get women priests.
Who knows?"
"Uh, th- the issue of the death penalty, um, is, is debated in this country.
But not, to the extent that it, that it is in the United States because we don't have the death penalty here.
Um, but it, it seems, it seems very strange to someone who grew up in this country, that, that a, a country would actually be able to, have the right over the lives of its citizens.
Um, and i, i, i, think it's in danger of being, uh, the, the, there's so much high-minded rhetoric.
Uh, a- about, that, that th- the actual issues are in danger of being missed.
I think that th- the main danger at the moment, um, is, is exactly, about.
But also the, the contribution of, of popular culture in, in, in America the, issue of the death penalty.
Um, because i've seen a couple of films, like <em>Dead Man Walking</em> that Susan Sarandon filmed.
And it's, it's a very, very well-made film.
Very well acted, directed, et cetera, et cetera.
And it_ and obviously, has a fairly, unambiguous message about, about the death penalty, I think.
But, i- in a sense i- it almost increases o- or_ the strengthens the institution, of the death penalty over there.
Because of it's_ a bit because it_ because of it's de- depiction.
It's not a positive depiction.
But it's a_ it's a_ it's a very sort of more scrutinised, depiction, of the death penalty.
Which doesn't, which doesn't really display any of its barbaritry_ oops barbarity or, the arbitrariness.
So, i, i, think if there was going be any change made, uh, in, in the law of the, of the United States.
It wouldn't be done, by films or by anything like that.
But by, a real genuine appeal, to the cases.
And it_ because it stretches over such a long period of time.
Any, any appeals on behalf of particular prisoners.
Because there's so many stays of execution et cetera.
It is, it just that it's a topic wh- which can be, so much spun out by anybody.
Th- that the actual issue never really is got to.
And then I think i- it's th- the, the life of the death penalty in the United State has probably got a fair bit to run, because of that."
"There was, once upon a time, a tailor.
Well, we might call him a tailor.
But, oh dear, the seams weren't straight, the hems were lopsided.
The silk wasn't the right colour, the cut was bad.
I mean, he was not much of a tailor.
And consequently he didn't have any clients.
And consequently, he didn't earn much money.
And consequently he was very poor, and consequently his wife was very upset, and annoyed.
Well, that's to put it mildly.
And, each night, if he had a little bit of cash in his hand.
He would go down to the local pub, wouldn't he, and drink.
And come back in the early hours of the morning falling into the bed.
Oh, you know the story.
Well, Monday, as usual, down to the local pub, he was.
And, it was quite empty, 'cos he got there early, didn't he.
And in the far corner, he saw this gentleman sitting with a, top hat, and a great black cloak.
Very unusual, oh- rather a posh looking fellow, he thought.
So he got his pint of beer, and he went over, and he said, 'do you mind if i sit down.
' 'Nooo... Not at all,' said the impressive gentleman, 'do, join me.
'Well, he put his beer on the table, did our tailor.
And then, looking down, as he sat down, he noticed some, rather strange looking feet.
They weren't feet at all, were they.
They were cloven hooves, belonging to, you know who.
Well, that was a bit of a_ that was a bit of a surprise, but he sat down and drank his beer, and passed the time of day.
And, um, and the old gentleman said, uh, 'you know who i am, don't you.
' Took off his top hat, and there were two horns, sticking out from the front of his forehead.
Oh dear, the tailor felt a little bit, more uneasy about this.
And, uh, didn't quite know uh, what to say.
And, looked around the edge of the table there, swishing noises] yes, there was the long tail.
It was the devil all right.
'Well,' said the devil, 'and how's life treating you.
' 'Oh,' said the tailor, 'how's life treating me.
I mean to say, i mean it's desperate, isn't it.
Desperate.
I ain't got no good clients.
I mean, they don't appreciate a fine seam, do they.
And there's the wife, i'll go home tonight, and &quot;nag, nag, nag,&quot; she'll be at me.
I don't know.
Life, life just isn't good at the moment, i can tell you.
' 'Oh, not so good is it.
' Said the devil.
'Well, i think i could improve matters a little bit.
I think i could, i think i could.
Um, what do you say to, three wishes.
' 'Oh ho, three wishes, hmm... Three wishes.
Uh, do you mean i can wish for anything i like.
' 'Anything you like.
' 'Oh ho, ha, bags of gold_ i could be a millionaire.
I could have a Porsche in the front, couldn't i.
I could be going out to the Beha_ Bahamas for the_ for my holidays.
And ho ho ho.
I'd be up there with all the celebrities, wouldn't i.
Oh, yes, three wishes.
''Well, just a minute.
Um, there is a little something you need to know.
Um, you can have these wishes, right now.
Anything you like.
And you can enjoy life fully, for twenty-five years.
And then, one day, i'll knock on your door, and i'll come to see you.
And you will come from the_ with me, down below.
' 'Oh, oh,' said the tailor.
'It's a bit hot down there isn't it.
' 'Ha ha, well, nice and warm shall we say.
' But um.
Well, the tailor scratched his head, and he hummed, and hawed, and he thought about his wife nagging when he got home, and hardly enough money to buy another pint of beer.
And he thought, 'done, i'll have those three wishes.
''All right.
As soon as you get home, you will have those three wishes.
You can wish for anything you like.
' [Whooshing noise] and the devil disappeared.
Well that proved to the tailor, that he really was the devil.
Well, our tailor friend goes home.
And, he opens the front door, and the whole cottage is filled with smoke, and his wife's in the kitchen crying away.
He goes in there.
'Look,' says his wife.
'Look, look what happened to this old cooker of ours.
Look, it's blown up, and the whole house is, is black, and, filled with smoke.
Oh, for goodness sake, you know, you promised to buy me a new cooker, didn't you.
At Christmas time.
And if you'd only bought me a new cooker, this wouldn't have happened.
The old one wouldn't have blowed up, you're_ are useless, absolutely useless.
I'm sick to death of you.
' Well she went on, and on, and on,and on, 'til the tailor turned, and said, 'oh, i wish i'd bought you a new cooker.
' [Whooshing noise] and there, was a brand new shining cooker, white and gleaming.
'Wh_ what's going on.
' Said his wife.
'Wh- what on earth's happened.
' Well, of course the tailor had to explain to her.
That he'd met the devil, in the pub, and he'd given him three wishes and... 'Three wishes, oh well thank God there were three, there's still two more.
Now look here, my, um, my man.
' She said, 'you get safely up to bed there, and don't you wish for another thing, 'til we get together in the morning, and we decide how to spend these two wishes.
Up you go.
'So, the tailor goes up to bed.
He falls into bed, and he goes sound asleep.
When he wakes in the morning, he has forgotten, completely about those three wishes.
And he goes into the bathroom, and he turns on the hot tap.
Ugh.
No hot water.
Why.
Well, he hasn't paid the bill, has he.
No hot water in the house.
Oh, darn it all.
He turns on the cold tap, splashes his face, &quot; ho ho ho.
Oh gosh, this is cold, i wish i'd paid that bill.
&Quot; [whooshing noise] suddenly hot water is pouring from the hot tap.
'Oh no,' he said, 'i've used my second wish, what am i going to do.
' Well of course he had to tell his wife, who said, 'now look here.
You keep that wish, you don't use it.
You don't use it.
Because, i'm sick to death of this, and the day may come, who knows, the day may come when i might be dying, or the children might be dying, and we need that wish.
Now, i'm going to give you a bit of advice.
You go down to the village, and you see the wise woman, and get some good advice from her.
Because, i'm sick to death, of not hav_ hardly having a crumb to put between my children's lips.
'So, the tailor goes down to the wise woman.
And she talks to him.
And she says, 'now look, all you want in life is to be healthy, and to be wealthy.
And if you could be those two things, you might learn a little bit of wisdom.
Now you just go back, and i want to hear about you, getting up first thing in the morning, and getting on with your work.
And taking proper measer_ meas_ measurements.
And getting that scissors of yours sharpened, and doing a good job.
Right.
' Well the tailor, has learnt his lesson, and back he goes.
And, would you believe it, yes, he's up at the crack of dawn the next day, and he's sharpened his lisso- scissors, and the first client to come in the door, he takes good measurements.
And, he does a good job.
And he gets paid a little bit more than usual.
Because it's a lovely suit there, that he's made.
And gradually he accrues some money, and he buys some better suiting, and better cloth.
And, the family grow up, and sooner or later, the sons join the business, and there's Tailor and Sons, written above the doorway.
And all is happy and well.
And that third wish is still unused, and safely guarded, by the wife.
Well, the days pass.
The weeks pass.
The months pass.
The years pass.
In fact, twenty-five years passed.
And there's a knock, at the door.
As you can guess, the tailor by this time, has completely forgotten.
He goes to the door, and there's a very tall, impressive-looking gentleman.
With a black hat, and a black cloak.
And as he looks down at his feet.
What does he see, but cloven hooves.
'Um, oh, y_ uh, well yes.
Oh, ha ha, i remember you, yes, do come in.
Do come in, ha ha.
Would you like me to make you a new cloak, or a_ or a fancy waistcoat perhaps, ha ha.
To impress them down below, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Well wh_ what can i do for you.
' 'Twenty-five years.
' Says the devil, 'i have come for you.
You've had your three wishes, have you not.
' 'Ubd_ oh, uh, well no, as, as a matter of fact, i haven't.
' 'You haven't.
' Says the devil.
'What do you mean you haven't.
I gave you three wishes.
You mean, you_ you've not used them.
' 'Well, uh, huh, uh, no, um, i, i used the first two, um, yes, a beautiful new cooker, and then, i_ and i paid the gas bill, so we got hot water.
' 'Is that all you used them for.
How disgraceful.
I'm insulted,' said the devil.
'Well, um, i, i've still got one left.
Um, uh, could i not use it, before i come with you, huh, huh.
I could leave the wife well off, couldn't i.
And, uh, you know, give her a nice castle or something.
Or, ha ha ha, uh, a Rolls-Royce, at the front door.
Something like that.
Yes, yes.
' 'Well, well this is most unusual.
I usually take my clients away straight away.
But, yes, if, if you must have your wish, you, you have your wish.
Ha ha.
Whatever you like.
''Oh, oh,' thought the tailor.
And thinking very hard, and sweating profusely, and rubbing his hands together, 'what the hell can i think of.
What sort of wish can i have.
Ah.
' He suddenly thought, 'ah, uh, this is my wish.
My wish is that you be transformed into a cow, and circle the earth, for eternity.
' [Whooshing noise] up into the air, went this cow.
And began circling around, and around, and around, and around, and around.
And the tailor, felt very grateful.
And very thankful, because he was quite warm enough, thank you."
"Whenever i, move to a new town or whatever, I like to find out something about the place that i’m living in.
And I especially like to find out, the kind of secret, elements of a, of a place.
The strange things, the ghost stories and the strange places.
So when I moved to Oxford, about fifteen years ago now, i, I immediately started looking around in libraries and asking people wh- what was happening and stuff.
There wasn’t actually a, book so I published a little pamphlet in the end of all the, various stories that i’ve managed to find.
And in fact the- the- uh, the- they’re quite a lot of things you could find out about Oxford in, in the end.
And, and certainly Oxfordshire.
It’s quite a strange place.
In fact we called the booklet Strange Oxford.
And we sold many thousands of those.
I suppose the first story that, [throat clear] we came across, and that, we worked on is, what was the source of Oxford.
What_ how did it all start.
Why is there a little place here at all.
Because apparently there, there hasn’t always been a settlement in, in this area.
Oxford is a, a Saxon place really.
A Saxon settlement.
Which means, you know, I guess it’s about six, seventh century of the, of the present era.
So it’s not as old as some places.
But I don’t know what was here before.
But it’s actually got it’s own legend of, of, uh, of why it was, was founded.
Uh, and this stems from the Saxon time when some Saxon, princess, I suppose, decided that she wanted to live, a spiritual life.
She didn’t want to get, married.
Although there was somebody on the horizon that her father wanted her to marry.
But she said no she wants to, go and become a, a nun.
Uh, anyway this wasn’t particularly_  didn’t go down very well with her family.
And so she had to run away from, from home.
And she came, obviously so the legend says, to the vicinity of Oxford.
And she was planning to sort of set up some sort of religious community here.
Well what happened is the, the prince who was hoping, obviously, to get married, maybe she was quite an attractive Saxon princess.
Probably was.
Actually followed her here.
Uh, and she was kind of worried that he was gonna, I suppose, fling her over his shoulder and, and drag her off.
So she kind of hid in, in the woods.
And as, as he approached the, the area, um, he was actually, so the legend goes, struck blind.
He was struck blind, uh, completely.
And just stumbled around rather a pathetic figure.
And she saw him and, even though she didn’t want to marry him, she kind of felt sorry for the guy, cause he’d been quite handsome and, quite strong and now he was blind and virtually sort of, he- helpless.
So she prayed to, Saint Margaret one of the Christian saints who’s quite interesting cause she’s connected with dragons and, all sorts of_ she’s quite a warrior, uh, figure.
And Saint Margaret appeared, I suppose sitting on the back of the dragon and struck the ground with a sword and, a, a little well_ a little spring came out of the ground.
And with that water, um, this princess, who we now know is Saint Frideswide, was able to kind of wash his eyes and, and cure him of the blindness.
And he was cured of his blindness.
Which maybe it was physical blindness.
Maybe it was spiritual blindness.
I don’t know.
And he, he left her alone to to live her life, and he went off and he, he, he lived happily ever after as well.
Now that spring, that little well... From that, legend is still present in Oxford.
It’s still there.
And now it’s on the outskirts of town.
Virtually t_ you know, no houses around at all.
But in the medieval period... It was a major centre of pilgrimage.
People came from all over to try and get cured of their blindness basically.
Uh, and it, it was renovated in the last century.
And if you’ve ever read the stuff of, Lewis Carroll and, uh, A- Alice’s Adventures in the Underworld.
The way that, Alice goes into the underworld is actually through, that scared spring.
You know the, the it wa- it was a real place.
And the story’s were written in Oxford.
And that’s supposed to be the entrance to the underworld.
And the_ it was known then as the treacle mines.
For some strange reason.
I’m not sure why, hehe, why, Lewis Carroll called it the treacle mines.
Although, someone did tell me that treacle was sort of healing fu- fluid.
So maybe that’s what it was was called before.
But, when you read it in the children’s book, the treacle mines, you think well there’s no such thing as the treacle mine.
But there is actually a treacle mine in Oxford, o- on the outskirts on, on Port Meadow.
And that is the origin of the city.
That is the oldest legend there is, right.
That_ more or less, right.
That they can find of it.
And that’s, that’s the origin.
So I was, I was quite happy to have found the centre, if you like, the beginning of Oxford.
And from that little beginning we went on to research, for other people, lots of other little strange mysteries connected with this place.
So I hope maybe you’ll come here and, and look at them for yourself one day."
"Um,in this lecture i want to talk about the British colonies in North America, and the establishment of the United States.
Um, in the seventeenth century, England set up colonies a- along the coast of North America.
Most of the early colonies we- were set up with the intention of making money.
Um, but, uh, they were not very profitable as business enterprises.
Um, most of the early settlers were from middle or perhaps lower-middle class families, who left England because they found conditions at home, intolerable.
Um, in those days people had to have good reasons to leave because, uh, the journey was perilous and life in the early colonies, was full of hardship, uh, uh, and danger.
And of course, returning home was no easy matter.
Um, there were other settlers, um, in North America, uh, besides the English of course.
The Dutch, um, had a settlement i- in the middle of the coast, which they called New Amsterdam.
Um, this was later captured by the British, uh, and was given a new name.
They called it New York.
And of course it's still there to this day.
Uh, there were also Swedish and German settlements.
Um, and of course, not all of the people of the colonies came of their own free will.
Uh, many Africans were captured in Africa and taken across the Atlantic forcibly against their will, and sold there as slaves.
By, uh, uh, seventeen fifty there were thirteen British colonies along the coast.
They were generally governed by an official who was appointed in England, but some of them had a fair degree o- of self-government.
And, they were of course protected by the British army and, th- the British navy.
Their trade was regulated by laws, uh, made in England.
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Uh, this was not a time of free trade, governments generally placed heavy restrictions on trade.
And also imposed heavy taxes, um, as did the British government.
And this often led to conflict between the colonies, and the British government.
The British colonies were on the Atlantic coastal strip.
And the area inland was owned by France.
Or at least claimed by France, i- i suppose we should really say that it was actually owned by the people who actually live there.
But, um, this was the time of, um, foreign colonies and, uh, um.
So the French believed they owned this land.
It was a huge area and it was very thinly populated.
And, as the,uh, colonists  a- a-along the coast, the English colonists slowly move west.
And, they came into conflict with the French, of course.
And then, from seventeen fifty-six to seventeen sixty-three there was a war between Britain and France.
And this was called the Seven Years' War.
F- for the obvious reason it lasted seven years.
Um, it was fought in many different countries actually.
It was fought, partly in India, in the West Indies.
And also, of course in North America.
France was defeated, and lost vast areas of land to the British.
Um, th- the land to the interior o- of the British colonies.
This land was given up by France and consequently a great deal of new land, um, was made available to the British colonies for, um, westward expansion to expand inland.
Um, and as a result, uh, many people who lived in the, um, American colonies started to move, um, westward a- and occupy this land that had been French land.
Um, the war had cost Britain a great deal of money.
And the government felt that, uh, the people who lived in the colonies should pay a share o- of, of that cost, as they had benefited greatly from the French defeat.
Um, however, when the government of George the Third tried to impose new taxes, um, the colonists resented this very very much.
And, uh, the situation_ i mean there was much opposition_ and the situation slowly got worse until there were outbreaks of fighting, and, uh, trouble.
And, uh, at first of course this was not called a war.
But, um, then in about seventeen_ i- in sev_ not in about.
In, actually, in seventeen seventy-six_ at that time probably only about a third of the people living in the British colonies were actively thinking about independence.
But in that year a, a, a group of people met in Philadelphia and issued, um, the very famous Declaration of Independence.
This was drawn up mainly by Thomas Jefferson.
And it was influenced by the ideas of Locke, and Rousseau philosophers.
And it stated_ it said some wonderful things.
It stated that 'all men are equal, and all have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'.
Um, of course, in practice this did not apply to the, um, residents of African descent.
Um, slavery was not abolished in, uh, the United States until the middle of the nineteenth century.
Anyway, the Declaration of Independence led to war.
The British on the one hand a- and the American colonists on the other.
The British had a large army and a very powerful navy.
On the American side they had a good general, George Washington, and, um, a- an untrained army, but nevertheless a very enthusiastic army.
Um... The colonists also had help from, uh, French [France] of course, enemies of the British.
And, uh, a number of other foreign countries.
Um, in Britain th- the war was not, popular at all.
The British people, um, we- were very_ gen_ often many of them supported the colonists.
There was a great deal of sympathy towards them.
They, uh, they of course_ the British people of course saw these colonists as British people at war with their government.
And, um, the course of the war, the, um, i- is of course much celebrated in the United States.
Uh... But_ and the American's did win some, some victories of course.
But... I- i-  in my opinion the British lost the war because they really didn't have a heart for it.
Uh,  the British were_ the British forces we- were not really deeply committed to the struggle.
They had, as i said a great deal of sympathy for the colonists.
In seventeen eighty-one, um, negotiated_ negotiations started.
And then in seventeen-eighty-three the Treaty of Paris was signed.
And, um... Uh, the British were very very generous i- i- in the terms they granted to the colonists.
And the colonists became independent.
And were granted a much much greater area of land than they had had before.
Um, after the war, um, a form of government was set up in the colonies which was not a success.
Um, so then i- in seventeen eighty-seven a convention was set up to prepare a, a new constitution for the colonies.
And, uh, this constitution set up a federal system, where each state was semi-independent.
But only the central government, the federal government could do certain things.
Such as declare war, regulate trade, or print money.
Um, this constitution of the United States was adopted in seventeen eighty-eight.
And in the following year, George Washington, the general who had led the, uh, forces during the American War of Independence, the_ uh, George Washington became the first president of the United States.
A- and thus the United States as we know it now, was established."
"In this lecture i'd like to talk about First World War... Um, that took place from nineteen fourteen to nineteen eighteen.
[Throat clear] The First World War was one of the most i-i-important events i- in modern history.
Um, in fact, it changed the course of the history of Europe, and many other places in the world.
The First World War was, different from, previous wars.
Um, many countries from all over the world joined the war.
And it was fought in many different parts of the world.
It was fought mainly in Europe, of course, but also in Africa.
In, um, West Asia the Middle East, in Eastern Asia, and the Pacific Ocean and so on.most of all, though, [throat clear] it was a war which used modern machines, uh, and, uh, modern industrial power.
And the whole population of each country had to work hard, to help the war.
It was probably the first, uh, total war.
Um, o- of course, it had many causes.
Um, but we can only discuss the the the most important ones here.
<>  Um at the end of the nineteenth century, uh, many people thought that the world was going to start a long period of prosperity and peace.
The industrial revolution had made it possible for everyone to have a higher standard of living.
Um, the red cross had been started in Switzerland.
The international postal union had been set up.
And of course, the Olympic games had started.
[Throat clear] however, um, the countries of Europe were also competing against each other, for new colonies and throughout much of the world.
And,um, the- they really didn't, uh, trust each other very much, and they were building larger and larger armies.
Uh, and starting with Germany, uh, many of the countries thought that they could protect themselves better if they made alliances with other countries.
An alliance is an agreement between two countries, that they will help each other if one is attacked by another country.
Um, so, uh, Germany made alliance, uh, with Italy and Austria and Russia and France made an alliance together.
And then Britain joined, uh, um, Russia and France.
A- and so most of the countries o-of Europe were connected together in a series of alliances such that, if one were attacked the other country would have to_ some other country would have to, go to their help.
Um, a very dangerous situation.
If two countries started fighting, they  would, become involved_ um, other countries would get involved.
And, thi- this means if one small incident could actually lead to a, um, huge war.
And that is in fact what happened.
On the twenty-eighth of June nineteen-fourteen, uh, this incident, uh, occurred.
It was a simple thing.
An Austrian duke was, um, killed by, um, some Serbian_ um, by a- a Serbian freedom fighter in, um, what became Yugoslavia.
And this led to a series of events.
Um... The whole of Europe exploded i-i-into warfare.
Um, many countries were involved.
Uh, uh, uh, a-and it's not sensible to, list them here.
But basically, there was Germany, Austria and Turkey on one side.
And France, Russia and England on the other side.
Uh, then in eighteen seventeen [he means nineteen seventeen], the Russians left the war, uh, because of the... Um, Bolshevik revolution.
And, uh, the U-S-A_ at the same time_ the United States joined France and England.
Japan also had a treaty with England which had been made in nineteen-o-two.
And Japan quickly joined the war on the English side.
But did not really, um, make a major effort.
The fighting in the [throat clear] um, First World War was very terrible indeed.
Um, the most important weapon was the machine gun.
Um, with this one soldier, could hide i- in a hole in the ground, and kill hundreds of other men very very quickly.
And so the soldiers, uh, lived in trenches, in the ground, and holes in the ground, where they would be safe from machine gun fire.
And then they used barbed wire... To create, uh, fences a- as it_ to stop other people, coming to protect themselves.
Um... Together the ma- machine guns, uh, and the barbed wired were the ma- major characteristics, of the trench warfare of of the First World War.
And... Uh, um, i- it's very difficult for us to realise, just how many people were killed, and how easily they, they were slaughtered.
Um, the number of soldiers killed in battle was probably something like about eight million.
I mean that’s a huge number.
And there were some, days that i- in certain battles, when, huge numbers were killed in one day.
Um, two hundred and fifty thousand or a quarter of a million soldiers killed in one day.
And this occurred, o- on a number of occasions.
And there were also many people killed who were not soldiers.
Um, of course, bombs, famine, disease, um, killed many other people.
Probably about thirty million people, uh, died a- as a result of of the First World War.
Eventually, after four years, the English, French, uh, and American side won.
But the cost to everyone, was very great.
A-apart from the, number of people who were killed, many parts of Europe were destroyed.
Millions of people l- lost their homes.
And, uh, most of the countries who fought were economically ruined.
There were of course, uh, important, um, political consequences.
Uh, the winners in the war decided that the losers should pay for it.
Pay for the war.
And th- the losers, um, all lost a a great deal of territory.
And had to pay huge sums of money.
And the map of Europe was completely changed.
Um, many new countries were created.
About ten new countries were made i-in Europe.
And, um, other countries we- were changed in size.
Two empires... Disappeared the Austrian Empire and the Turkish Empire, disappeared.
Um, new countries were made in, uh, the Middle East in Western Asia.
Many colonies throughout the world we- changed hands, were moved from one country to another.
And, um, of course some countries in the world finished with different political systems, from when they first entered the war.
The-the most famous case of course being Russia.
Um, the Communist Party started a revolution in nineteen-seventeen and formed a government.
An- and this of course had considerable influence on, the later development of Europe in the twentieth century.
There were many other, um, changes, uh, due to the war.
I-it's impossible to overestimate, uh, the influence of First World War.
There were social changes.
For example, um, it was really because of the war that, that, that, um, women started to take a-a-an active part in the politics.
Uh.
During the war, many women took jobs that men had done before.
Because the men went off to fight.
And the women often, uh, of course did a perfectly good job, and did it quite well and people realised that, that, um, women ne- needn’t- weren’t necessarily second-class citizens.
And the women’s' liberation movement, um, really starts, uh, as a result of this war.
Um, the First World War did change the course of history.
Um, political history economic and social history throughout the, whole world a-a-a-and led to the, future developments of the twentieth century."
"Um in this lecture, i'd like to talk about the French Revolution, and the wars which followed it, and their effect on Britain.
Towards the end of the eighteenth century... In seventeen eighty-nine, there occurred an event, which had a considerable effect on the rest of Europe, this_ the French Revolution.
And this lead France into a war wi- with most of Europe.
And this war lasted until eighteen-fifteen.
Um, in the middle of the eighteenth century, France was quite prosperous.
But the government was almost bankrupt.
And the king had abs_ almost almost absolute power.
And society was divided into three classes.
Uh, the clergy, uh, the nobles, uh, and then all the rest.
And the government of the country was very inefficient.
Uh, uh, and many people deeply resented it.
And then in seventeen-eight-nine... Um, the king Louis the sixteenth, realised that his government was totally bankrupt, and he, he needed some kind of help.
And he called a meeting of all the representatives of the people.
And at this meeting, uh, the representatives could not agree on, on what to do.
And so, uh, riots broke out in in Paris.
And the rioters a- attacked, um, a large prison in the centre of Paris, uh, called the Bastille.
And in fact they captured it.
And, uh, the fall of the Bastille of course is a very famous significant event i-i-in French history.
And this was followed by riots, um, throughout the whole of France.
As a result of this a new government was formed.
Uh, uh, with the king's power, greatly reduced.
A- and, many of the nobles fled abroad.
And eventually the king decided to flee too.
But he was caught.
He was disguised as an ordinary citizen, uh.
A-and was caught and brought back to Paris.
Um, th- the new government was always, uh, arguing and always divided and squabbling.
And there were some that hoped that, uh, a successful war wou-wou- would unite the people and help to put things right.
And so in seventeen-ninety-two France declared war on Austria.
And, uh... Soon afterwards, um.
An Austrian army i- invaded France.
And this, uhm, caused panic and, uh, it lead to mass riots i- in Paris.
And, um, eventually a, a new government came to power.
And this new government abolished the office of king.
And the put Louis the sixteenth in prison.
And then later, they, um, tried the king for, plotting against France, for treason.
And then, uh, found him guilty.
And on the twenty-first of January, um, seventeen-ninety-three, he was guillotined.
The means he was, uh, put in a machine that chopped off his head.
Um, in the war with the Austrians, at first the French armies were successful.
And th-the French people decided that they should export their revolution, to the other people of Europe, uh, and free them too.
Of course the other people of Europe was not always very happy about this.
Britain, for example, did not want, uh, liberty, equality and fraternity.
These were the buzzwords o- of the French Revolution.
And so a- a coalition was formed of France [this is a mistake, he means Britain], Holland and Spain joined with Austria and Prussia in the war against France.
And of course, this put France in great danger.
And the government, took, two steps to deal with this danger.
Firstly, they introduced conscription.
And every man between the age of eighteen and forty-five was liable to military service.
And secondly, they started, um, the reign of terror.
And anyone suspected of being against the revolution was sent to the guillotine.
And hundreds, and hundreds o- of people had their heads chopped off by this machine.
The guillotine.
In public of course.
After the reign of terror, there was a new government.
And this lasted for about four years.
And this was not a popular government.
But it did encourage good leadership in the army.
And during this period, from about seventeen ninety-five to seventeen ninety-nine, saw the rise of one talented young general.
And his name was Napoleon Bonaparte.
He was born in Corsica.
Uh, he was an artillery officer and he became a general at twenty-four-years-old.
He was a short man, very vain, a- and very ambitious.
But he was also a military genius, a- and was one of the most capable generals of all time.
One of the, uh, most capable military generals of all time without doubt.
And the history of Europe from this time until eighteen-fifteen is basically the history of Napoleon's wars.
It is very complicated, um, lots of fighting and lots of countries involved.
Um... His first successes were in Italy.
And after this, uh, he became very popular with the French people.
And he organised a coup d' etat and made himself the dictator, of France, the ruler of France.
And eventually, um, Napoleon came to control most of Europe.
Um, he fought lots of battles, and was more or less undefeated on land.
But he couldn't attack, his enemy Britain, uh, because the British controlled the sea.
So there was a sort of stalemate.
Um, Napoleon couldn't control_  couldn`t defeat the British at sea.
And the British couldn't defeat Napoleon on land.
And, uh, so as a result of this the British decided that they would try to defeat Napoleon economically.
By blockading... Closing off, um, the whole coast of Europe to prevent imports going in and_ and they hoped, in this way to bring about the economic ruin of Napoleon's empire.
Um, at the same time, um, Napoleon,uh, uh, of course he controlled Spain.
And, um, the British sent troops to Lisbon, the capital of Portugal.
To help the Portuguese, um, and this was in eighteen-o-eight.
These soldiers... Um... Fought, uh, in Portugal and in Spain.
And they were helped by the Spanish guerrillas.
Spanish people who fought against the French.
And they slowly, drove Napoleon's army out of Spain, and into the south of France.
At the same time, Napoleon another very serious problem.
In eighteen-twelve, he decided to attack Russia.
Um, he raised a, a large army of about six hundred thousand men and set off, and marched to Moscow.
However, the Russian army did not fight him.
They destroyed all food, all crops and all buildings in his path.
And, they also formed, uh, guerrilla bands.
Small bands of soldiers or, or private people, uh, to hara- harass and attack the army i- in small places.
And, when Napoleon reached Moscow... The town was deserted.
The whole town was virtually empty.
And there was not enough food, uh, for Napoleon to feed his army.
And as winter, approached.
As we all know the Russian winter is very terrible, very cold.
As winter approached, uh, Napoleon decided he to retreat back to, uh, Prussia.
Which is eastern Germany.
And he turned round and set off with his large army, to walk back to Germany.
And his army was constantly attacked, by the Russian army, uh, and by the guerrillas.
Um, there was no large battle, just constant small-scale attacks.
And even- eighty percent, of, Napoleon's army did not get out of Russia alive.
Uh,this was a huge defeat... For Napoleon.
And many of the other countries in Europe of course were very happy, at Napoleon's defeat.
Uh, and they took the opportunity, to attack him, um, as he arrived back in France.
And in eighteen thirteen, the next year, his enemies captured Paris, and made Napoleon a prisoner.
And they sent him to a small island in the Mediterranean Sea, called Elba.
And, the brother of Louis the sixteenth was made the king of France and he was called, Louis the eighteenth.
Of course Napoleon did not like being a prisoner on a small island.
And so in eighteen-fifteen he secretly returned to France.
And he raised a, a new army.
The king of France, fled.
And, Napoleon fought his last battle, in Belgium.
Near a small village called Waterloo, on the eighteenth of June eighteen-fifteen.
His main enemy was a British general, called th- the Duke of Wellington.
And Napoleon was heavily defeated...  Um, by the British and th- the Prussians also fought at Waterloo.
And Napoleon was heavily defeated.
And was sent as a prisoner to another small island.
But this time, though, it was a, a small island in the South Atlantic, called Saint Helena.
It was thousands of miles, from the nearest land.
And Napoleon died there six years later.
So for the twenty years, from seventeen-ninety-five to eighteen-fifteen, Britain had been at war with France.
At the end of the war, France was defeated.
And Britain was left as the strongest power in Europe.
With undisputed control, of the oceans of the world.
Britain was without doubt th- the most powerful country in the world."
"Many stories are shared in form, between different cultures, and different countries.
And this is, um, a song of war.
A song and a story of war.
And, although this version comes out of the American civil war.
Um, other versions have come out of other wars.
And usually the, story is called The Letter.
But this version I have added, um, verses of an American folk song to it.
And we call the whole thing The Hills, of Shiloh.
Have you seen Amanda Jane wandering through the morning rain.
Have you seen her wandering down, wandering through the sleeping town.
In her yellow dressing gown, amongst the hills of Shiloh.
Have you heard Amanda cry, seen the tear drops in her eye.
Listening for the sound of guns, listening for the role of druMs  and for a man who never comes, from the hills of Shiloh.
I was a soldier, in the Union Army, under General Grant.
Me, a Pennsylvania farm boy, in a blue uniform and boots.
And one of those new Springfield rifles.
We went marching out of town and, the flags were all flying and, banners waving.
And all those pretty girls, they were all smiling at us.
And it felt good to be a soldier.
And we marched on out of town and, the band stopped playing.
And they turned round and went back.
And I guess they wasn’t comin’ to the war with us, and that seemed a right shame.
Well, we marched down out of Kentucky and, we marched clear across Tennessee.
I began to think the war was all bout marching.
And that whoever marched the furthest would be the winners.
Then I heard the cannon, way off to the west it was, like, summer thunder.
The closer we got, the louder it got.
And I don’t mind telling you, I was scared.
But I didn’t tell anyone.
And we crossed the big river and, we came to this little place called Shiloh.
And we went up into the hills beyond it.
And there was a ridge.
And along this ridge there was a shallow ditch and, we were lined up along this shallow ditch and faced off down the slope.
And the officer came in front of us and said, 'no matter what those rebels throw up this hill at us boys, they ain't going to get past, they ain't going to take the ridge.
''No sir,' we said.
'No rebel solder is gonna get past us.
' And we waited on there.
And it came on night, and I pretended to sleep.
And when it came morning there was mist, mist so thick you couldn’t see twenty-five paces in front of you.
And we were told to fix our bayonets, and load our rifles.
And face off down that slope.
And that we did.
Then I heard it.
Heard the sound of boots, thudding on grass.
Coming up the hill through the mist.
Couldn’t see a thing, but I could hear those boots.
I don’t mind telling you I was scared.
And then those boots started into running, and we heard those rebel yells coming up through the mist.
And the officer was saying, 'don’t shoot boys, don’t shoot.
Don’t shoot until you see 'em.
'So, we held our fire.
And then out of the mist they came.
All those rebel soldiers running towards us, bayonets.
And comin’ straight for me there was an officer grey uniform with a sword raised, looked like it was going to slice me in two.
And I raised my rifle and I shot him.
Right between the eyes I shot him.
And he came crashing down in amongst us, dead.
And then it was hand to hand.
It was swords.
It was bayonets.
It was rifle butts.
It was boots.
It was anything to drive those rebel boys back down that hill.
And drive them back we did.
Back down the hill, back into the mist.
There was no sound of boots anymore.
Just the... Crying of the wounded.
And some boy out there, calling for his mother.
When the mist lifted we could see what we had done.
And those rebel boys lay out there like old grey sacks of corn.
And I wasn’t proud of what we had done.
And we waited there.
We waited for them to come back.
But they didn't come back.
And it came on night again and this time... I feel asleep.
And when I woke it was black as pitch.
And I had a thirst on me, like I had never known before.
And I reached for my canteen and then I cursed because it was empty.
And a voice came out of the darkness beside me.
'What’s the trouble friend.
''Ah, I got this thirst on me,' I said, 'and my canteen, it's empty.
''Here, take mine,' said the voice.
And a hand came out of the darkness and, handed me a canteen and it was full.
Ah, water never tasted so good.
I drank the half of it and, gave it back and, thanked the solider beside me.
And then we got to talkin’ the way soldiers do.
Until he said to me, 'friend, I want you to make a promise on me.
In the pocket of my tunic is a letter.
If I die up here on this ridge, if I get killed up here.
I want you to promise you will take that letter to my wife, so she'll know I ain't comin’ back.
''Oh, you ain't gonna die,' I said.
'No more than I am.
No, me and you friend, we will see this war through together.
''Well, just in case.
' He said.
'Promise.
'So I promised... And I guess I fell asleep.
And when I woke, light was coming to the sky, and I turned to wish good day on the solider, and to thank him for giving me of his water.
But there was no soldier.
Lying beside me cold as the clay... With a bullet fall through his head was the rebel officer i’d shot as he came up the hill at me the day before.
I don’t mind telling you, I was scared.
A chill went through me like a knife.
My hand trembled so I could hardly reach into the pocket of his tunic.
And there sure enough was a letter addressed to... Amanda Jane, down there in Shiloh.
I carried that letter with me right through that damn war.
And when the fight was over i, tramped back clear across Tennessee, and across the big river.
And I found that address.
And I don’t mind telling you I was scared.
I walked up and down outside that house best part of a day, before I took up courage to knock on the door.
And a lady came.
I didn’t say anything.
I just handed her the letter.
And stood there and watched her read it and watched the tears come down her face.
Till she turned to me and said, 'were you a friend of my husband's.
'God forgive me.
I didn’t have the courage to tell her... I was the man who had killed him.
'No,' I said, 'we were just two soldiers who shared a canteen of water.... One dark night... Up there in the hills of Shiloh.'"
"What our congress is doing now, i consider, very shameful.
It gives a very, biased opinion of what this country is like, to the rest of the world.
Uh, and what bothers me most is, that this circus is being paid for by, people like me, tax payers.
And we have no choice... As to, how long it should go on, what direction it should go into, why it started in the first place.
Um, we have a government of checks and balances.
That's supposed to check and balance what's happening.
As far as i'm concerned, i don't care what Princeton does, but, uh, uh, i, i excuse me.
I don't care what Clinton does, in the White House or outside the White House.
Whatever he's doing, it's his business.
He's certainly not the only one who did it, and there will be others after him.
And, uh, we're just wasting our money, wasting our time, bills aren't  passed, things aren't done right.
Because the congress is very busy making the democrats look bad.
Uh, everything they say is true.
The one to be concerned about that, more than anybody else is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
And if she is accepting i, who are we to judge.
Uh, he is doing a good job for this country.
He's, a, he is a no-goodnic, that's for sure.
Do you know what a no-goodnic is.
He just doesn't want to, um, face the reality.
He split hairs to make himself innocent.
And according to what he's saying, he is innocent.
According to the definition he's using, he is innocent.
But, none of them, none of them are accusing him are innocent, either.
And he just should be allowed to pay attention to his job.
That's what we are paying him for.
We are certainly not paying congress to do what they are doing.
And they should stop, they should've stopped long ago.
And no intention of stopping.
And it's going to keep costing us money, that's the part that bothers me.
I don't know why_ how they could be allowed to continue this nonsense.
It just giving us, bad impression_ giving the world a bad impression of where we are at here.
And it's certainly not a true impression.
It's just as bad as, as judging America by the movies you see that come out of this place.
That's not the truth either.
But... It's just, ridiculous that all this goes on, when so much that has to be done, isn't being done.
And it seems as though it's gonna go on, and on.
I think their intention is to make the democrats look so bad that, the next election_any any political election after this, the republicans will get it.
And i fear for the country if they do.
They, they, they're out for the man with big money.
After all these... Programs that the, that the social program's have been taken away.
They're going to make it worse.
They're gonna... Make it better for the man with the money.
And let those who don't have, really be without.
Clinton's plans for, for the little people aren't always hundred percent.
Thought out properly.
They're not always, um, feasible, possible.
But of course, he has the interests of the general public at heart, because that's where he came from.
And that's what, he is concerned about.
He's also concerned about his pocket, his own backside, and the all the rest of that, but he's human like all the rest of us.
Leave him alone and let him do the job we put him there to do."
"I'll tell you about the Jersey Devil.
I think only people in New Jersey know about him.
The Jersey Devil was, born probably in about the eighteen hundreds, in Leeds Point in the southern part of New Jersey, the part of New Jersey called the Pine Barrens.
The Pine Barrens are a unique place, it's a kind of like the Everglades.
It's, uh... Big swampy areas, with red water and unusual types of trees and things growing that... Botanists come from all over the world to study because they're unique.
The Jersey Devil was born, like I said, in the eighteen hundreds to Mrs  Leeds, of Leeds Point.
At the time she found out she was pregnant, she already had twelve kids, so when she found out she was having another baby, she cursed it.
And some people say that's... The start of the Jersey Devil.
When she went into labor... The baby came out, and the midwife screamed and fainted, and the baby flew up the chimney cuz he had wings.
He had wings and a tail... And he looked a kind of like a monster.
But, some people say he wasn't a really monster.
He was, uh... Well he looked like a monster but he was sad and a lonely type of a... Creature hehe.
At night you can hear him kind of crying and moaning and wailing sometimes.
And ever since, the eighteen hundreds farmers_ sometimes their_ some of their, uh, livestock would disappear and they would see tracks or find evidence and, sometimes they would say, it was the Jersey Devil.
And even in modern times when people, go into Pine Barrens and start talking about the Jersey Devil and joking about him.
Things will happen like, the car will stop dead, and the lights will turn out, and the whole electrical system will die, just for a little bit, and then it will come back on again.
So, some people think he's only a legend but some people say they've seen him or had experiences with him.
So that's the Jersey Devil."
"When i_ when i was born my fam_ my parents spoke English, and Kikuyu.
They mainly spoke Kikuyu, at home when, nothing was wrong.
When my dad is angry he speaks English.
And, Swahili was spoken to the workers who were not Kikuyu.
Um, there were people who used to turn the garden or_ uh, look after the cows, milk them and take the milk to the dairy.
And... Now as i_ as i went along i picked up other languages.
Um, Kikuyu is my mother tongue.
Both my parents speak Kikuyu, who have spoken it from when they were children.
And it is a Bantu language  spoken by over three million people in Kenya.
And, uh, it is a very rich language.
It's derived from, from a Bantu language that was spoken in the Congo_ in the Congo forest, before the Kikuyu people migrated from there.
When people from South Africa and Tanzania, and some Ugandans speak, i can hear what they are saying because it's Bantu.
It sounds very close to Kikuyu.
Um, when i went to work in hospitals, i learnt a few more languages.
Because i used to get many old, patients who didn't know any other language but the one that they spoke when they were first born.
And this included Somali, [Ambu, Meru, xx] amongst others.
In, in all i speak, about ten languages.
Um, as i was working in hospital there was war that had broken out in Somalia.
Which is bordering Kenya.
And the United Nations was bringing many patients from there.
Um, they only spoke Italian and Somali.
Most of them didn't even speak the Italian.
Um, Somali is a very difficult language to speak.
But, i had to learn it, because i had to know how to take care of these people.
Um, main_ the main things i learned were, how to say, 'i am in pain.
And i need medi_ medicine.
I need some water, or i'm cold.
' The things that you need_ the basic things that you need to look after somebody.
And most of them used to say, 'i've got a lot of pain in my legs.
' Um, because they had had amputation.
Um, they were getting phantom pain.
So,um,  i learnt, most of the other languages pretty much for the same reason.
Because of the old patients who could not speak, Swahili or English.
And it was very rewarding and, it used to surprise many people that i could speak their language.
Because it's a very rare language and, you don't often get a Kikuyu person who speaks other languages.
Apart from English and Swahili.
I learnt to speak [Lingala] also, [Lingala]  is a language spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Which was formerly known as Zaire.
And, uh, most of the Kenyans_ most Kenyans love Lingala music.
They love the language al_ they love the music although they don't understand the language.
And they buy most of, um, the music from the artists in Zaire.
I learnt the language because, um, a very popular group came to work in Kenya.
And, uh, they had several shows to put on.
And, they_ they kept having their clothes stolen when they took them for dry-cleaning.
So, they employed by them, to take their clothes anonymously to the dry-cleaner.
So that they wouldn't_ people wouldn't keep them as souvenirs.
Uh, because they were beautiful clothes.
And everybody wanted to keep something that belonged to Suku stars.
So i learnt Lingala so that i could communicate with them.
Because, i found French very difficult.
Lingala was closer to Kikuyu.
So, it was an easy language to learn.
And i speak it very well.
Um... People who speak different languages in Kenya don't usually intermarry.
But, um, with ch_ with times changing, i've learnt to interact with different people from different ethnic backgrounds.
And, i've got a sister who's married to somebody who's a Kumba.
So, i was forced to learn the language as well.
Uh, she speaks it fluently.
So, i learnt the language and, it sounds very much like my own.
And, uh, the_ these languages are very diverse, so you have to learn many new words.
And, in the end if you can get understood by more people, the better.
So you_ you, you're able to communicate with a wider group of people..."
"Now there probably was a King Arthur, but probably not the King Arthur of modern novel and television.
Certainly not the King Arthur of Merlin’s magic.
But a lot of legends have grown up about King Arthur and his knights.
And this is this is one of them.
It is called the Marriage of Sir Gawain.
Gawain, he was the nephew of King Arthur.
Surely he was one of the wisest and the most chivalrous of the knights of the round table.
And this is the story of of how he came by his bride.
Now it happened that King Arthur was travelling in the north of his realm, when his path through a wood was blocked by a huge and hairy man wielding a wooden club.
'Out of the way and let me pass.
' Said the king.
'Ah King Arthur, pass if you can', jeered the huge hairy man.
Thinking to teach this lout a lesson, up went the king’s sword.
And down came the fellow’s club.
And somehow there was the king of England lying in the dirt.
And how that huge and hairy man did beat King Arthur.
Beat him until he was black and blue and tied him hands and feet under the bell of his own horse and lead him away to a grim and grimy castle.
And when he came to his senses Arthur realised that some magic was afoot and found himself powerless in the castle of the huge and hairy man.
And he was forced to serve as his drudge and to perform the most degrading tasks imaginable.
And after several days of this unable to bear such degradation he humbled himself and knelt before the huge and hairy man and begged to be released for whatever ransom might be asked.
'Why King Arthur, I thought to have your head after you had served me awhile, but I am a sporting fellow', rumbled the huge and hairy man.
'So, I shall let you go on one condition.
With in a year and a day you will bring me the answer to a riddle I shall ask you.
And if you do not bring the answer, then, I will have your head.
' Arthur was relieved to accept.
He was good at riddling and so were the people of his court so he was sure he could find the answer to any riddle.
'So what is your riddle.
' He said.
'Riddle me this,' said the huge hairy man, 'what is it that a woman most desires.
What is it, Arthur, that a woman most desires.
The answer in a year, or your head.
' So Arthur was released from his captivity and when he got back to Camelot he called his knights and their ladies and the courtiers to him.
Told them of the witchery that had befallen him.
Of the promise he had been forced to make and of the riddle.
'What is it that a woman most desires.
' He asked them.
'Riches,' said one.
'No, no, love,' said another.
'Beauty,' said a third.
'Noble husband,' said a fourth.
And many a husband said, 'what a woman most desires is a life of idleness.
'  Oh, they all had answers, but they all had different answers.
None could agree.
So Arthur knew that it wasn’t going to be so easy to find the correct answer.
But there was time.
He and his knights rode east and they rode west.
They rode south and they rode north.
They rode to every corner of the country and questioned all they met.
But no one seemed to agree on the answer.
And the year passed and it came time for Arthur to set out for that grim and grimy castle.
Knowing in his heart that he had not found one answer.
Yet he was resolved to meet his fate with chivalry and courage.
And he was riding alone in silence through a wood full of darkness when he came across a bent and cloaked figure sat upon a rock.
So evil did the figure appear that he turned his horse aside to keep distance between him and this hag.
But she called to him in a cracked voice, 'King Arthur, do you not want to hear what I have to say.
Do you not want to hear the answer to the riddle you have been set.
' Arthur urged his horse towards the crow.
He caught but a glimpse through her hood of the most hideous features he had ever looked upon.
Running sores and greasy hair and teeth rotting in their guMs  and he would have turned, but she held him with a one good eye.
Beckoned him with her grimy talon.
'So what is it that woman most desires.
' She jeered.
'I cannot tell,' admitted Arthur.
'But I can.
If you grant me my wish and if you swear to tell no other but the huge hairy man the answer that I shall give, I will tell you.
' 'Your wish is granted and I shall tell no other,' said Arthur, without thought leaned close to the stinking breath of the creature to hear hope whisper the answer.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he realised at last that he had the answer and said, 'so what is it you wish of me.
Gold, jewels, titles, land.
' 'I want no gold, no jewels, no titles, nor land.
All I want is one of your knights as husband.
I shall come to your court in one month time and you will wed me to one of your knights.
' Arthur felt the sickness in his belly.
How could he ask one of his knights to marry such a bride.
And before he could speak the crone had faded into the mist and he was alone.
He soon found himself at that grim and grimy castle facing a huge and hairy man.
'Ah, King Arthur, you have returned.
Am I to have the answer, or am I to have your head.
Now I am a sporting man.
I will give you three answers.
What is it that woman most desires.
'  'Love.
' Said Arthur.
'No.
'  'Beauty.
'  'No.
No, King Arthur, you seem not to have the answer.
So perhaps it is your head I shall have,' laughed the huge, hairy man and reached for the great battle axe that hung against the wall.
But, Arthur stopped him with a gesture, looked him in the eye and gave him the answer the old hag told him.
'Curses.
' Swore the huge, hairy man.
Flung down the axe and strode away in anger, for that indeed was the right answer.
So King Arthur mounted, rode away from the grim and grimy castle.
Although he went with his head still upon his shoulders, his heart was heavy with the promise he had made to the old hag.
Word of his coming went ahead of him and his knights and their ladies received him with great joy.
'So you found the answer to the riddle, me lord.
Pray, what was it.
' They asked.
'I am sworn not to tell,' he replied.
'But why so sad, lord.
' They asked.
And he told them of the promise that he had given.
That in return for the answer to the riddle, one of his knights must marry the foulest of old crones.
Without hesitation it was Gawain who stepped forward.
'I will take her, my lord.
' 'Ah Gawain, she is the foulest woman I have ever set eyes upon.
I could not wish her upon my enemy.
'  'I will take her, my lord.
She saved your life,' insisted Gawain.
In great sorrow Arthur had to accept.
So the wedding date was set and the preparations for the feasting put in hand.
At last the day came and all the court lined the gateway to welcome the woman who had saved the king and was now to be bride of Sir Gawain.
But all recoiled in horror as the bride to be rode into Camelot.
A scrawny donkey she rode.
Her hair was filthy, tangled, her head bald in patches.
Her skin was flaking.
Her nose dribbling and warty.
Shrunken lips were drawn back over yellowed stumps of a few remaining teeth.
Her scrawny body was like a sack full of bones and her naked feet were like claws, and she stank.
Dressed in an old gown of white lace, she was a mockery of a bride.
Yet gallant Gawain greeted her and handed her down from the wretched beast.
And not a flicker of horror that turned his stomach showed upon his fine features as he led her into the hall and took his place beside her at the wedding feast.
Most had little stomach for feasting, except the bride.
She ignored both platters and knives, but with ragged nails tore at the meat and bread.
Cramming food into her mouth until the juices ran down her chin and dropped onto her withered breasts.
She had enough for six, drank enough for nine.
Belched like a dozen.
The guests were quick to depart.
And so it was that Gawain found himself alone in the bridal chamber.
'A kiss for your bride then', cackled the grotesque creature.
Gawain feeling an immense pity for one so ugly closed his eyes and kissed her watery old mouth.
She embraced him.
And instead of the sack of bones, and the parched skin he had expected, there was a sudden softness of flesh in his arMs  fragrances of roses in his nostrils.
And he opened his eyes to find trembling and blushing before him an unblemished beauty of no more than eighteen years.
In the full flower of a maidenhood.
He stood back in amazement and she smiled.
'Sir, your kiss has freed me from the spell cast upon me by that same huge and hairy man who overcame Arthur with his evil magic.
I am your bride and happy to be so, most gentle of knights.
But I am only half freed of the evil cast upon me.
Only half of my time can I spend in this, my true form.
The other half must be spent in the loathsome form of the hag you thought you were marrying, so what will you choose Gawain.
Will you have me like this by night, or by day.
' Without hesitation Gawain answered, 'the choice must be yours, my bride.
Your will is mine.
' The girl gave a cry of joy, flung her arms about her groom.
'Gawain, now you have broken the spell completely, for you, without thought have just answered the riddle that was posed to King Arthur.
What is it that a woman most desires.
Why, since Eve first walked her one desire is still in all her dealings just to have her will.
You have given me freedom of choice Gawain, and that is what woman most desires.
'She stood back from him holding her arms out so that he might see her in her full beauty.
'This will now be my shape forever.
I will be beautiful for you by day and by night.'"
"When i was ten years old, um, one day my dad came from work and, uh, he parked the car, and changed his clothes.
Changed into a pair of overalls that he could go into the garden with.
And we were living on a very big piece of land.
There was, fifteen acres.
Most of it under farming.
And he went down into the garden to check on what the workers were doing.
And it was around three p-m when he got home.
Um, that night my mom kept saying that she was feeling nervous.
She was feeling uncomfortable and she felt watched as she was walking about in the compound.
And, we settled very late, at around eleven PM then my dad heard some scratching noises at the back door.
And he thought it was my mum who had gone out to check on something.
But as he approached the door a sword came through the door and, cut him just above the lef_ the, left eye.
And, he starting retreating.
He refused to open the door, and the door c- caved in.
By then he was, up in the ceiling, and he was running along through the house.
And there, were stones being thrown through the ceiling, because it was made of soft material.
And, uh, he jumped out of the ceiling into the kitchen, and he crashed onto the cooker, fell on the floor and he jumped out_ got out of the house and ran to go get the neighbors.
In the meantime, about nine thieves had entered the house.
They hadn't bothered to wear any masks.
All the lights were on in the house.
And we had scampered and gone into my mom's room, where we were hiding.
Um, there was nine children all of_ all together.
Three of them my stepmother's, and six were my mothers.
My stepmother was not home that day.
And, uh... The thieves came to the bedroom.
They crashed in_ into the door.
And, they wanted my mom to give them money.
Only they weren't sure which of us was my mom.
Because some of us are very tall.
Mom's not a very big lady.
So, they beat us all up, and_ in the meantime some of them_ there were others outside, that we didn't know about.
They had caught my dad running_ running through the woods.
And they had broken his arms and legs.
And, they cut him in several places, including his head.
And they brought him back, literally in pieces.
They brought him back, and, they were demanding to have the car keys, and money.
And they weren't going to leave until, he'd given them that.
In the meantime the rest of them heated some food in the kitchen and settled down for a meal.
And they were behaving like they actually lived there.
So we didn't know how long they were_   it was going to continue.
And, um... In the end my mom told them where the money was.
There was just a little money.
The equivalent of eighty pence.
That's all she had in her purse at the time.
There was no more money in the house.
We weren't very rich.
And my dad gave them, a thousand shillings, which is about ten U-K pounds.
And, they were satisfied with that.
They stole all the things that they could carry.
Including electrical equipment.
Uh, they broke the television.
They slashed the sofa set, and they destroyed anything that they couldn't take with them.
And they stole two cars, and they drove off.
And, my dad, my dad couldn't walk so my mother went and got help.
And he was taken to hospital by the police.
Now, the police arrived two hours after they were called.
And they came to the neighbors first.
Dropped off some people there to protect the neighbour, because, he is a rich man, and he was a minister.
So, they protected him first before they came to check on what was happening.
So in the end my dad, went to hospital.
He went to a very poor hospital.
Because that's where the police took him.
And they stitched_ they stitched him without any anaesthetic.
And they mended_ they put plasters over the limbs that were broken.
And he came home the same day.
And, uh, since that time my dad has always kept a gun in the house.
And he decided to protect himself because, police won't protect him.
And, that has been a cause of a lot of distress in my family.
Where to this day he still keeps a gun.
And he threatens anybody with it, including his own children."
"I'd like to explain , uh, how our high school, our school system is set up.
Uh, maybe to ease any confusion.
Um, first some school districts uh_ well, i, I'll talk about New Jersey because every state is just a little bit different than, uh, each other.
So in New Jersey it's set up where you, you can go to preschool if you want to.
Uh, this is... An option.
It's not really mandatory.
And then you, you start your public schooling and kindergarten, um, which... I guess would be five six years old, somewhere in there.
And then you go on a first grade and second grade and so forth.
Uh, that wou- usually elementary school is first grade through, third or fourth grade.
And the you get into a middle school which could be a different school altogether.
Uh, where I went it was a different school, so that was from fourth grade to eight grade.
Um, at middle school can also be considered, your junior high school.
Uh some other school districts, your junior high would be seventh grade through ninth grade.
And, uh, that kind of follows along with, uh, your growing stages, and, uh ,everything that you would learn, huh, about adolescent psychology.
Um, why you are grouped in with certain people and a certain age range, so that, uh, you're supposedly more, more comfortable.
And it's a better learning environment.
Although that's up for debate.
Uh, and then, you get into a high school.
Um, which is_ in New Jersey it, it tends to be, uh, from ninth grade to twelfth grade.
Uh, ninth grade would be your freshman year, then tenth would be your sophomore, and then junior and senior year are your eleventh and twelfth.
Um a typical day in a class room.
I, I'll talk about,uh, high school because it has been a quite some time since I was hehehe in, uh, any other class room.
But in high school,um, you wake up, and my high school we went_ uh, we had homeroom to start the day and that's where you_ uh, usually you meet up, um, with, uh, students of the same letter or  same, beginning letter of your last name.
Uh, so I was in the W homeroom.
Um, we uh_ there was about forty of us in there.
Uh, that homeroom that we had, that was the same homeroom we had from ninth to twelfth grade, so if you became good friends with the most of people that were in there.
That meant from seven-fifty to I guess, about ten after eight, so you were in for about twenty minutes.
And you would talk about events coming up in the school, like , a football game or some sporting event, or a, a- assembly, or, uh, some speech, or homecoming.
It was just some kind of high school event that, uh, would be going on or coming up.
Um, then attendance would also be taken for.
Uh, the school during this time.
Um, then you'd go from there to your, uh, first period class.
And we had eight periods, uh, of regular class, and, uh, we also had a ninth period, that was for tutoring or any extra help that you wanted, but that wasn't a regular scheduled, class that you would have.
Um, our classes ranged from, in my high school, uh, in particular, ranged from_ uh, we had home economics class, uh, then from wood shop to stuff like that, to, um, events, labs, we had, uh, a- advanced placement calculus, advanced placement biol- biology, uh, and uh, physics as well.
So we had, uh, some... Nice labs with, uh, nice equipment in there, computers and everything was modernized.
Um, my high school in particular, uh, was, I guess, you could consider the classic high school where_ it had pillars in the front lawn and, uh, there was a huge red building, red brick building an, uh, two stories.
And, uh, it was, very nice school.
Uh, and most of the schools are that way.
Uh, if you want to have a picture of our school, I guess, you could just imagine any typical school and that would have_ that was ours.
Um, after your ninth period if you, uh, were involved in sports then_ or a- any other activity, uh, you could be in a band or you could be in a choir or anything like that, and uh, football baseball, uh, that would_ uh, that would proceed after_ the end of the day.
I I believe our school finished at three forty-five which was late for, uh, most high schools.
Um... So i_ oh huhuhu another thing the periods uh_ the length of each classroom was only about forty-two minutes long.
And then you had five minutes to walk in between classes.
So, that just gives you a little bit of idea of_ just a small bit of an idea of what a_ some classroom or some high school in America is."
"A very long time ago in a town called Hamel, (Hamelin) in Germany, there, there was a rat invasion.
The rats scurried into town, by the dozens and hundreds and thousands.
At one point, you couldn't even step on the ground, or touch, or touch the_ touch a tree without touching a rat.
They would wake up_ people of the town, would wake up in the morning with rats in their britches, in their shoes, the rats ate up all the food also.
The more tha_ the more they killed the rats, the more they came.
They tried dogs, and cats, and rat trappers and prayer, and saints, and nothing seemed to work.
One day a man walked into town.
He was a gawky looking man, pretty curious w- we would say.
He had a felt_ a black felt hat, really big and round, and he danced and sang a song, ""who lives shall see, this is he the rat catcher, who lives shall see, this is he the rat catcher.""  the townspeople, came into a meeting and they, they asked, ""well.
What can we do.""  the town councilor said, ""oh we've seen this man.
And the man has said to us, if we pay him a sum of one dollar a head, then he'll m-make all the rats disappear.
The town's council, they sat there and thought, ""can this be true.
Is his man a magician.""  the town councilor said, ""well we're not sure yet but we'll, we'll work this out.""  so the town's council got together and asked the man to help them.
The man said, ""okay, so you'll give me one dollar, per head and I'll have them all out by the, the end of the night."" so around nine o'clock he told people to go into their houses.
He stood by the church and played his song.
And he also played the bagpipes.
Which first came out very soft, and then became really urgent and loud.
And a beautiful sound but pretty loud.
So the rats all started to come from all the little cracks and crevices of the town.
And they gathered around the bagpiper.
And he began to sing and dance and hop towards the bridge.
The town bridge was above a river.
This river was big and deep and long.
And the bagpiper said, ""hop, hop.""  and all at once, the rats began to hop in the river.
Millions and millions and millions of rats.
That's what he thought.
Now the last rat to jump, was a big white old rat.
The white rat said, ""they're all, they're all gone friend.""  and he said, ""how many were there.""  he said, ""about one less than a million.""  he said, ""that's excellent.""  so, he went back to the town and he said, ""it's all done, sir.""  well the town councilor said, ""all done.
So where are the heads of the rats.""  the, the man said, ""well you didn't ask for the heads of the rats.""  the town councilor said, ""we'd pay you a dollar for each head.
But since you've helped us, we'll give you about fifty thousand dollars.""  the man said, ""keep your money.
I'll be paid by your, by your heirs.""  so the town council found out about this, and they laughed and thought, ""paid by our heirs."" so, one day they went to church all the townspeople, except for the children.
And when they returned home all the children were gone.
And, in anger and, and despair, and urgency they ran around searching the towns nearby for the children.
And, when they came back to town tired they found three boys.
These boys told the story of what happened to the children.
One boy said, ""well when you guys went to church, um, the bagpiper who helped us with the rats.
He came back and he played his bagpipes for us.
And we danced and sang and we followed him to a mountain.
And, the mountain was opened.
We all went towards the mountain.
We stayed out because, or I stayed out because I got hurt.
He stayed out because he's_ he was running so fast he, bumped into the mountain and fell down.
And he, he stayed out of the mountain, because he also got hurt, because he was rushing so much.
The music was so great.
The bagpiper left.
But as soon as we stood there, the mountain closed up and we couldn't get in here.
We couldn't get in.
So we came back here.""  so all the townspeople went to the mountain.
And they searched and searched for a hole in the mountain to find their children.
But they couldn't find them.
[Sigh] so a hundred fifty years later, all the parents and uncles and aunts are gone.
And, we have the mountaineers, who were walking on the mountains one day.
And they found some people who only sp-spoke German.
But all of them spoke Hungarian in a Hungarian, Hungarian state.
All that could be thought of, were that these were the lost children of Hamel"
"The past few weeks i've been dreaming a lot about playing soccer.
Two nights ago i had a very interesting dream about playing soccer.
I was on a soccer team comprised of African pygmies.
Pygmies are... People from Central Africa.
They live in tribes, and, physically they're very short.
Um, not many are over five feet tall i think.
I think they're very short people.
So i was on a soccer team of African pygmies, everyone except for me was an African pygmy.
And our opponent in this soccer game was a team of Liverpool youth players.
These were... Young, boys who were very good at soccer.
And would grow up to be professional soccer players in England.
So these were our opponents.
And... The feeling was that, um, my team of African pygmies was the underdog.
There was no way that we, would have a chance against these future professional players.
That they would... Outright embarrass us, and score many goals against us.
So when the game began i was not one of the starting eleven players on the field, for the African pygmies.
I was one of the reserve players, waiting on the side lines.
At half time of the game, it was still zero zero.
I was very impressed and i thought, everyone must be a bit surprised that this team of African pygmies were, uh... In a tie, zero zero, with the, uh, future professional players.
And then, the dream became very magical.
Um, it's a bit of a ritual or custom, for soccer teams to, come together before the game starts.
Or even at half time and have a little chant, or have a little pep talk together.
So they ga_ the_ so the players would gather around in a circle and, perhaps say inspiring words to each other.
Or perhaps do a little cheer.
So at half time, the African pygmy team gathered round in a circle.
Myself included.
And i was, towards the center.
And then they began singing, in a style of music which is very beautiful.
I once, uh, bought a CD of African pygmies singing and it's a very beautiful style of singing.
With many many voices.
Uh, maybe twenty, thirty people singing at once.
And it's_ and the music is very natural and spontaneous.
It's an improvised music, with voices rising and falling.
Calling out and rhythms changing and circling round and round.
So this style of music was what this, soccer team of African pygmies began to sing.
And i began to sing with them.
And imitate, and copy the sounds that they were making.
Very high pitched sounds, and very low sounds.
And a sort of swirling and circling feeling.
And as we were physically in a circle, we began to... Spin or move with the music.
And we began to float up and down, and round in this circle.
And it was a very magical feeling.
And then the dream haha ended haha.
And that was the African pygmy soccer team ritual for, starting the second half of their soccer game, against the Liverpool players.
And that was a very enjoyable dream.
When i woke up i felt very good."
"There has been polemical discussion in the academic world, with regard to whether, The Red and the Black, by Stendhal, can actually be considered, uh, a chronicle of  eighteen-thirty.
The tite_ subtitle of this book actually is, ""chronicle of eighteen-thirty.""  but the question is whether or not it really is an accurate assessment of the, uh, realism of, uh, Stendhal.
As a realist, Stendhal is supposed to give a mirror, a reflection of reality.
And Stendhal's writing in the nineteenth century_ so he should give an accurate description of what was happening in the nineteenth century when he was writing.
However, there is some debate about this.
And I will examine this topic from the, from, uh, three viewpoints.
Actually, in these viewpoints we will_ act_ are actually tied in with the re_ July Revolution of eighteen-thirty.
And, uh, this re- revolution is actually never mentioned explicitly in this novel.
However it seems to be mentioned implicitly, and this is what I am going to describe.
First of all I am going to talk about the viewpoint of Napoleon which is in this novel.
Napoleon who was measur_ mentioned explicitly.
And actually, uh, Napoleon is actually considered one of the impetuses for the July Revolution of eighteen-thirty.
And, um, in, in the sense that, many Bonapartists and many people who, wanted Napoleon to come back, were actually involved in this July Revolution of eighteen-thirty.
And, uh, I'll talk about that.
First of all, it seems that Napoleon is mentioned many times in this novel.
And the main character in ""The Red and the Black,"" Julienne is obsessed with Napoleon and images of Napoleon.
There seems to be deification of, uh, this historical figure in the novel.
For Julienne has a picture of Napoleon.
There is constant talk about Napoleon and, um, for Julienne the, um, memoirs that Napoleon wrote whilst he was in exile is considered his bibleso Napoleon is everywhere.
And in_ does implicitly at least, the July Revolution of eighteen-thirty is mentioned.
Second of all, uh, there is mention here, explicit mention here of the congregation.
Now the congregation was, um, it was a religious organization during the eighteen-thirties.
Non-existence, non-existence [not in existence] any more.
However, this group had a very, very powerful influence in French politics at the time.
And they exersed [exerted] influenced very much politically because there were key figures from this group.
It was a religious group.
Originally founded as a religious group.
But they were key figures from this religious group, involved in French politics.
They were in very high level of government.
Now the congregation is mentioned, throughout the novel as, um, being a corrupt organization.
And as being in all areas of government.
For example a char_ a key character in, The Red and the Black, by Stendhal, uh, for example_ the, the mayor of, um, this town where it takes place, Verrières.
He is a member of the congregation and he, um, had got_ he got_ became the mayor because various members of the congregation propped him up.
Now the congregation is generally considered one of the impetuses of the July Revolution of eighteen-thirty.
One of the factors, key factors.
And since it is mentioned very much explicitly, that is nevertheless somewhat of an implicit mention of this revolution.
And thus it shows how Stendhal's really using a mirror.
This is Stendhal's realism, sort of a mirror of, events which are happening at this time.
So really it seems to be, that there're_ it shows that it seems to be a chronicle of eighteen-thirty as its subtitle suggests.
And a good example of his realism as well.
The third thing is from the standpoint of the, um, uh, of the July Revolution eighteen-thirty being a bourgeois revolution.
Uh, there are many mentions,mentions in this book of the, uh, bourgeoisie and how, how they're, um, an important factor here.
Very powerful actually.
An up_ uh, a class which is on its way.
And, um, actually many historians considered the, uh, revolution of eighteen-thirty as being a bourgeois revolution.
And due to the discontentment of many bour- many members of this class actually that, uh, there was such an uprising.
Because they wanted more power in the government.
They felt that_ actually members of the aristocracy were in the high seats of government.
And they wanted to overthrow them.
And they thought there was an unequal political system at the time.
Because they didn't have the rights that they wanted.
And this is actually when Julien who is the main character of this book.
Is put on trial, he is actually put on trial for a ki_ for trying to, um, murder another character in the book.
He is put on trial and bo_ Julien who is actually a member of the peasant class is being tried by actually a jury.
They are members of the bourgeoisie.
Uh, this seems to, um, actually be somewhat of a signal of what is happening in general at the time.
Which is that bourgeoisie's rising.
There're many members of the bourgeoisie in the judiciary and in the government and_ but, and yet they are discontent about, um, the fact that they do have some power.
But that the congregation... Has so much power.
And there seems to be a sort of a bourgeois backlash against it.
And this is happening very much historically at that time in France.
And this book mirrors, um, the rising bourgeoisie.
As well as, you know, as I said the rising congregation.
So, um, although this book never explicitly mentions, um, historical events of eighteen-thirty.
It nevertheless implicitly mentions various events.
The major three.
Napoleon, the congregation, and the rising bourgeoisie, and thus it can be considered an accurate mirror of eighteen-thirty and a good assessment of Stendhal's realism as well."
"Okay religion, in my life it's, it's been from, um, Jehovah's Witness to Christian.
Now Jehovah's Witness is a Christian, but they put turns on his words somehow.
They say you cannot_ they put different rules on what is right and what is wrong, in their church, or in their <i>Hall</i> as they call it.
Now when i was younger i was Jehovah's Witness, and they say you're not allowed to celebrate any holidays.
And, we weren't the type of person_ type of family to not cerebrate holidays.
So we did anyway.
So we weren't true Jehovah's Witnesses.
But, we did, we did, um, have <i>Hall</i> every Sunday or Saturday.
And we had study sessions in our house when we read some books or something, or a magazine called <i>The Week</i> or <i>Awake</i>.
And, i don't remember too much about that, but you know it wasn't very fun for me.
It wasn't something that was enlightening to me.
Um, now my father was a Muslim and he bought Farrakhan [Muslim minister] tapes home all the time.
And he... You know talked about poor thing all the time.
That's what i really got from it as a young child.
And, um, very preachable, very strong minded, um, about his religion and black men and strength.
And i i thought, as a Muslim man he should've been more of a, of a father or yeah but he wasn't.
I don't know.
He, he was a Muslim.
But he wasn't like orthodox.
He didn't keep his children up.
He didn't visit his children all the time.
He didn't, you know, honor his wife or something like that, or just make sure his wife was taken care of and stuff.
Um, so i sort of lost interest in Muslims and... I, you know i tried to learn more about God himself, and just read the bible and go to church.
So my freshman year in college, um, i started trying to go to church more.
And i'm looking towards God for answers.
I pray to him more often.
And it feels good.
It feels better than wha- whatever ever else, like Muslim religion and or, i guess Muslim yes, and Jehovah's Witnesses because they have so many limits on you.
And, being a plain Christian or, what i consider myself to be is simple.
You know, i, i talk to him, i pray to him, and, i you know, i praise him and i thank him always because he does so much for me.
He has done so much for me, regardless of what i've done.
Which is lovely, you know, um, and being in  college is a good thing to have on_ a good thing to have is faith, because you_ sometimes you just need it.
And you need to be able to know how to pray when you really need, when you really need something, or you really need some help.
When you really think there is no one else there for you.
He's always there and he's always listening.
And he can always hear you wherever you are.
So, you know no matter what you've done, either, he'll still listen to you, he won't like stop and say &quot;well you did that so i don't want to you, i don't want to listen to you.
And i'm not going to bless you at all.
And i'm not going to do anything for you any more.
&Quot; you know he won't do that to you.
Um, and it's up to you to just to go to him.
And i did and, you know, i'm just happy about that.
And i want to continue to start you know, to read his scriptures and getting to know him more through that.
And just go to church and praise him and just... Have fun with it and be good.
And, know that i have_ I know God and i'm happy."
"In this lecture, i want to talk a little bit about ideas.
And ways of thinking.
And how these changed.
And particularly talk a-about, how these changes in thinking, affected British history.
Um, between the middle ages and the modern world, there were two main intellectual changes which took place.
Um, the first one, uh, we call the renaissance.
And the second is often referred to as the age of reason.
The renaissance, the word means the rebirth of learning, started in the fifteenth century, in Italy.
It came to Britain a little later, in the sixteenth century.
About the time of Elizabeth I's father, Henry VIII.
Um, intellectually, it was a very exciting time.
It-it was the time when Europeans, um, discovered the history of Greece and Rome.
And people in Europe started studying all the interesting things, written by the, people of the ancient world, ancient Greece.
Um, during the long period, um, from the end of the Roman Empire u-until that time, until the renaissance.
Um, people in Europe had generally forgotten a, a, a lot of the things that were known in the ancient world.
And, many of these ideas were very new... Um, to the people of Europe at the time.
Despite the fact that they were often a thousand-years-old.
These ideas led to, new ways of thinking.
Which started to change society i-in many ways.
Um, uh, ah some of the changes of course, uh, were in religion and, um, led to, um, attacks on the Catholic church and the, the movement towards Protestantism.
And, um, i think we can see the renaissance as the end of the middle ages.
And the beginning_ if not the beginning of the modern world, at least the beginning of the transition, to the modern world.
Um, this, uh, new learning, um, or the rediscovery o- of the old learning, um, led to much new thinking.
Um, by the end of the, uh, seventeenth century, uh, many new discoveries of science started to change people’s lives.
Uh, the first, uh, important new discovery, oh, and very important new discovery, came in sixteen-eighty-seven when, um, an Englishman called Isaac Newton, published his important work on the law of gravity.
And Newton also made other discoveries, which now form the basis of the science of physics.
His contribution to science was probably greater than a-any other person ever.
Or certainly greater than any other person at that time.
And, um, he had a huge influence on the thinking of men of his own time, as well as on later scientific thought.
A famous English poet, a chap called Alexander Pope wrote, um, about Newton, he said,'nature and nature's laws were hid in night, God said &quot;let Newton be&quot; and all was light'.
Other important new discoveries were made.
For example, a Dutchman called Leeuwenhoek used a microscope, to discover bacteria.
And a whole new world of tiny creatures, which had been invisible before, was discovered.
Um, Robert Hooke discovered that living matter was made of tiny cells.
And at the end of the seventeenth century, Robert Boyle, um, did experiments with gases.
And he became known as the father of modern chemistry.
And as the eighteenth century progressed, more, uh, and more discoveries were made.
During the eighteenth century, what we call the scientific method developed and became quite common.
This is the idea that nothing should be accepted as true, unless it has been proved so by experiment.
Uh and this scientific method, this very simple idea is the basis of the development of modern science.
Without it, we would have very little knowledge of physics or chemistry.
Without the scientific method, we would probably be living in a world without cars, telephones, televisions, or any of the other important inventions made i-in the last two hundred years.
The eighteenth century is often called the age of reason because of this.
In the eighteenth century, many people tried to use this way of thinking i-i-in all sorts of fields of study.
Not only science, but thinkers and writers of this period tried to test everything by observation.
They tried to find cause and effect relationships in everything.
They believed generally that truth could be found by logical thinking; that is, by reasoning.
And hence the age of reason.
These attitudes of course uh affected philosophers and political scien-scientists.
John Locke believed that the relationship for example between the ruler and the ruled, that is between the king and his people, was a type of agreement.
So if the ruler did not do his job well, then the people had a right to remove him because the ruler was breaking his agreement.
And these were very radical new ideas.
It's only a hundred years before, that Charles I, um the king who was uh beheaded after the civil war in England, after his war between parliament a-a-and himself, Charles I had believed that the king was sent by God to rule the people.
Now a hundred years later John Locke's ideas were very very different.
In France, a man called Jacques Rousseau was an influential writer.
He believed that man was born good, but became bad because of his environment.
That is, he became bad because of his education and his laws.
And these were very new ideas at the time and of course, many people didn't like them, uh but the idea was developing at that time, that a man had the right to his own opinions.
This was the i-important idea of free speech.
And this is a-a new development, characteristic of_ we we take for granted in the modern world.
But this developed during the eighteenth century.
For example, another Frenchman, called Voltaire, made a very famous statement, he said, 'i don't agree with what you say, but i will defend to the death your right to say it'.
These are very very radical new ideas.
So the development of the scientific method, uh and the freedom to express new ideas, led to modern science, and developments, which changed the world completely."
"I am Ebony Laticia Tucker and I'm a part of the Tucker family.
The Tucker family consists of two boys, three girls and, a mother, because the father is a dork-head.
Um, my oldest brother is Sean and he's twenty-five, twenty-six now.
And I love him.
I used to be his favorite sister.
But he changed and went evil or something.
And after he went to the_  after he came from the army, he had gotten married and had a child at the age of nineteen.
And,  I lost him.
But that's okay cuz now he has_ he sees his son once in a while, unfortunately, but he sees him.
And we talk once in a while also.
My second oldest brother i- is supposed to be twenty-three this year.
But he's dead.
He died when he was twenty-one.
Um, he divorced my mother when he was fourteen actually.
And I hadn't seen him, since then.
So it was kind of weird the way I spoke to him on the phone two months before, he died.
He was supposed to come see us, and, supposed to.
Like, get to know each other again.
But I didn't get a chance to.
So_ um, I have an older sister who is_ her name's Medea.
And she is twenty-one because all the girls are three years apart, twenty-one, eighteen and fifteen.
Now , Medea is mean.
She doesn't like me, so we don't get along.
And we've lived in the same house for about five years_ for all our lives actually, and she hasn't spoken to me in about five years.
Um, I've tried to find out why she doesn't like me.
And I've tried to ask her, being the more mature sounding one, because I mean she is twenty-one, but she doesn't act it.
But, um, I haven't gotten a good response.
So I just sort of given up for now.
And maybe when_ you know we turn thirty something, then I'll try again.
Um... Me, I'm eighteen and I guess I'm_ how to be_ I don't want to rush my age thing,you know.
I'm the happy go-lucky, Tucker girl.
I'm the, very energetic, uh, independent, go for_ go for everything, Tucker girl.
Unlike Medea, who is a, sort of mean, artsy type on her own.
I don't know type.
Anyway, um, we'll go to my younger sister, who's Michelle.
She is fifteen years old, lovely, beautiful, beautiful girl.
She is about_ I'm about five four and she's about five seven.
So there's a diff- a big difference in a height there.
But that's okay cuz you know she's still my younger sister.
Um... She's an individual.
She is a... Really, different Tucker girl.
Cuz she's not like any of us really.
She's not like me or my mom.
She's like, a comedian slash_ um... I don't know girl.
Hahm, because she's so weird, because she has this really different style.
Like her music is totally different from all of our musics.
She listens to a mix of, folk and alternative, and country.
And it's all good I love it, but you know, it was different.
Her dress is like, a, grunge slash_ she's trying to be girlie now because she' going to be sixteen this year.
And, you know, I just love her and she is just wonderful.
And, when we were younger, um, we were into foster care for, about a year maybe ,or a half a year.
And I took care of her.
That was my little baby.
And, my mom even tells me that to this day that, my sh- my sister used to listen to me more than she did my mother.
Um, that's why we are so close whatever_ and I'm just_ I just want to, help her to get out of the house.
She's the last child.
Get out of the house, be successful and, do what she wants to do.
Because she's a big fan of volleyball.
She loves volleyball.
She is a, great player.
And she wants to study physical therapy.
And I just want to help her do that.
Being her older sister who actually helps her.
Because my older sister, Medea, she doesn't really help Michelle.
She... She tries to get Michelle away from me.
She tries to, you know have Michelle not like me any more.
So she tells Mich- she'll talk to Michelle about me to her.
And it's just ridiculous.
But... That's my whole family including my sisters and my brothers."
"The system of junior education in, the countries of the former Soviet Union is, quite different from that in the United States.
Because we don't have any separation, any division for secondary school, high school, or something, or primary school or something else.
Because there is only, school, in the Ukraine.
It takes ten years for you to complete.
You start when you are seven and, you graduate when you are seventeen.
Of course, there is some other option which is eight year program.
It works when you_ person really feels that, he, doesn't need any other education and that person feels that, he, he or she should go and find some work.
For all other people it's ten year program.
And as soon as you are done with that, you may apply for the study in the university.
And definitely, you may, or you may not get accepted.
That means that, some people will go to the university to pursue higher education, some people will go to training schools, and some people will go to find some job that they, can get with their kind of education.
So that means that, the junior education takes, ten years, and there is, certain assigned set of classes that you are supposed to take, which is, similar to the system of higher education in the Ukraine.
So that means that you have to take your math, you have to take your physics and so on.
And, another particular feature about, the junior school in the Ukraine and the Soviet Union was in_ even in the recent years that we didn't have any access to computers for example, which is, pretty wide spread in the United States.
But surprisingly, I would say it didn't affect the abilities of the graduates, really a lot.
Because at this point I feel that it's a more or less general policy in the United States, that computers could affect the abilities of, students in school greatly.
But my own opinion that it's not always the truth.
Because for example I know from my own experience that I didn't have any access to computers while I was a student at school.
And first time when i, touched the button on the keyboard when_ was when I was the student of first year at the university.
Well, seven years later, right now I'm working in the computer based applications for the drug design, which means that I'm working with the, unix-based computers, and with the work stations.
And I don't feel that I have a lot of trouble with that.
Well, I think that the only conclusion you can make from that is, that it's not the computer that defines the ability of the person but it's the person, that should have that ability in order to operate that computer or to make any, decisions.
That means that if the person is smart enough, he will get_ he will get any answers from any probleMs  and it doesn't depend on the presence of, or absence of the computer in the classroom.
But that's my own opinion and it, it may not be the true. "
" once upon a time there was a man, who was very very wealthy.
All he desired and cared about was to accumulate wealth.
To gather possessions and to be a rich, rich man.
It occurred to him one day, that when he was to die that he would lose all these possessions, and this disturbed him greatly.
He thought, ""i do not wish to lose all my possessions, I wish to be a wealthy, rich man forever"".
So, one day the man decided to go out into the world and search for a land where there was no death.
He thought that if he could live in such a land, then he would not ever have to give up all his possessions, his wealth and his riches.
He said goodbye to his family, his possessions and his home, and set out.
Whenever he came to a new land, he would ask the people who lived there, ""do people die here.
Is there death in this land."" .
If the people replied ""yes"" then he would keep moving.
One day he came upon a land where he asked the question, ""is there death here.
Do people die.""  and the people responded, ""we do not even know the word death"".
And the man thought, ""well if there is no death here, aren't there a great number of people.
I do not see a great number of people, is there not death here.""  and the people replied... &Quot;there is no death.
The reason we do not have a great number of people is because, from time to time there is a voice, and whoever hears this voice, they get up and leave, and go away and never come back""... The man thought this was very strange and he asked, ""does everyone hear this voice.""  and the people replied, ""no only hehe those who get up and leave have heard it, those who do not hear it stay.
And those who do hear it, they get up and leave, and never come back"".
So the man thought to himself, ""well if I were to live in this land, and when I hear the voice, if I do not, listen to it and I do not get up and leave, then I can stay here forever.
And be a rich wealthy man for all of my life, and never die"".
So he man went back to his home.
Back to his family,and back to his possessions.
He gathered everything up, gathered up his family and all his wealth.
And moved to this land where there was no death.
After he had set everything up in order.
Setting up all his possessions.
Putting order to his wealth.
Organizing his family in this new land, he said to his family, ""if you ever hear a voice calling to you, telling you to get up and leave.
You must ignore it, you must not listen to it.
You must stay and live in this land with me forever.
And we will be rich and never lose our possessions"".
Many years passed and no-one in the family heard the voice.
Not the man, not his wife, not his family.
One day however, whilst sitting at the dinner table, eating a meal.
The wife suddenly stood up and she called out, ""i am coming, I am coming"" and she began to go towards the door.
The man immediately ran before her.
Stopped her and grabbed her and said, ""no do not be a fool.
Do not listen to the voice.
You will go away and never come back.
Stay, stay here with me"".
The man had all his servants go to all the doors and the windows.
Bolting and locking them so that, his wife could not escape.
Seeing what her husband had done the wife, finally fell back and sat in her chair.
The man thought his wife had finally come to her senses and would not listen to the voice.
So he sat back down at the table happy.
However, as soon as the wife saw him do this, she immediately rushed up, unbolted one of the doors and ran out.
The man ran after her.
He grabbed her coat, however her arms slipped out of it, and she continued running and she was never seen again.
So the man's resolve was even greater than before.
He thought, ""if I ever hear this voice I will not listen to it.
I will not get up and leave.
I will stay here with my wealth, and I will be rich forever"".
Again many years passed and the man was sitting in the barbers.
His face was lathered with soap.
And the barber had a razor at his chin shaving his beard.
Suddenly the man cried out, ""no I am not coming I will not listen to you"".
The barber looked astonished.
All the people in the barbers looked astonished.
The man continued, ""no I will not listen to your voice.
I will not leave this place.
I will stay"".
Again and again, the man shouted, ""no, no I will not listen.
I will not leave.""  the man became so agitated, he took the razor from the barber's hand and said, ""i will not leave.
I will stay here voice.
I will give you a thrashing, and then you will see, I will stay here forever with my possessions and my wealth"".
The man rushed out of the barber's store waving the razor in the air, saying, ""i will not leave with you voice.
I will silence you forever"".
The barber did not want to lose hehe his razor.
And he too followed the man chasing after him.
Out of the town they ran.
The man with the razor in his arm, waving it wildly.
The barber chasing after him.
Finally they came upon a great hole in the earth.
A great chasm and precipice in the land.
The man waved the razor in the air, and flung himself into the chasm.
The barber saw what happened and stopped short.
He did not wish to fall into the hole in the ground.
The barber turned around and went back to the village.
He told the people what had happened.
He told them that he saw the man with the razor fall into the ground... When the man led all the town's people out to where the hole in the ground had been, it was not there any longer.
There was no hole, no chasm, no precipice in the ground.
The people turned and went back to the town.
Since that day, no longer did the voice call out.
No longer did people hear the voice and cry out, ""i am coming, I am coming.""  leaving their lives and falling into the hole in the ground.
Instead from that day, there was death in the land and people died, just as do all mortals across the world."
"Concerning, uh, <em>The Women of Algiers in Their Apartment</em> by Assia Djebar.
I am going to be talking about the objectification of women in this novel.
And their language of bodily resistance.
First of all with regard to the objectification of woman in this novel.
They seem to be suppressed in many ways.
Um, first of all physically, uh, the women in this novel, the Muslim women who are in this novel, wear veils, they wear very heavy clothing.
Physically suppressed by what they wear.
But also_ you can also look back at the title <em>The Women of Algiers in Their Apartment</em>, and, uh, you see that's, uh, gives you an image of a confined space.
And if actually this title comes from a painting by de la croix_ Eu_ Eugene Delacroix a famous French artist in the nineteenth-century.
And, uh, it is also is_ is a picture of women who are very, elaborately dressed in, wh_ in, this is, uh, female harem, actually, in, in this one room and they're, um, confined.
So there's this image of confinement.
And also if you look at the opening signals you can see this, um, objectification.
For example in the very beginning of the novel there is a dream by, um, a male and he is dreaming of his wife who is actually bondaged in a hospital room and they are performing some sur- surgery on her things like that.
Again this image of bondage is at play here.
And actually in many others, this is throughout the novel as well from the beginning, onward.
And with regard to actually_there is also another phenomenon in this book, it is related to this.
It is actually called panopticism, and this word panopticism actually comes from a novel by Jeremy Bentham.
It's called &quot;Panopticon&quot;.
And what panopticism is, is that, it is, uh, when someone is actually, looking at someone, um, through a sort of.
. .  A peephole, and that person can't see.
For example, there is let's say some one who is at a distance.
And then the other person is in, um, in a building all alone.
And the person who is in the building.
Sort of in a prison.
Cannot see the other person looking at them.
But the other person is looking inside and can see whatever they are_ that prisoner does.
That sort of_ in a nutshell, uh, the, um, concept of panopticism.
And here in this novel we see this occur many times in fact.
Um, the women in this no_ novel the various Muslim women actually they_ in their culture they are allow_ they are not allowed to gaze at men, for a prolonged period of time.
Yet the men can look at them for as long as they want.
And, uh, you can see this, um, in this constant_ at play in this novel.
A third thing that we see is then... Des_ then despite this suppression by this male society, um, this Muslim culture.
There is also the language of bodily resistance on the part of these women.
For example if we look at one of the characters in this novel, her name is Leila.
She was actually, a freedom fighter during the Algerian war for resistance against France.
And she was a bomb thrower.
So she used to carry the bombs and.
Actually her body has become maimed as a result.
But you can see here, uh, this character who appears throughout the book, uh, you can see this desire for, for freedom on this part of woman.
Of_ uh, so_ against the sort of suppression by this male society.
To actually, um, be in this realm of the males, to do what a male usually does, which is fight in the war.
And you can also see it also in the very famous bath scene which occurs towards the, uh, middle of this novel.
When various female characters are taking baths and then they, they liberate themselves from the very heavy clothing that is accepted in their culture.
And then is a very_ this becomes a very erotic experience.
Where they_ where Djebar, she talks about the beauty of the female body in its nakedness, without all the very heavy clothing, that they_ that these Muslim women usually wear.
And it is sort of their own language.
Their own bodily language of resistance, here we can_ that we can see.
And also we can see this in their_ in the dreams of these Muslim women.
A lot of this novel talks about ma- many of the dreams that they have, and the dream of just running and running and running, that one of these main characters has.
And liberating themselves from, all the suppression in this very male dominated society, that we have here.
And, uh, the author Assia Djebar actually talks about the ultimate language of body re_ resistance in this novel.
Which would be through the writing process.
And, uh, so here that would be really_ uh, she feels, uh, the method for, for at least herself, in her life, how she herself has liberated herself from such, um, patriarchal society of, um, Muslim women."
"Several months ago I saw, the movie called Titanic.
Um... I saw it actually on opening day in the United States, and the, the theater was was packed.
And... This turned out to be the norm for that movie for several months.
People from all over the world streamed into the theaters to see this movie including, uh... People from all over the world.
And it was really quite a phenomenon to see, how many people how many different types of people went to see this one movie.
And, from reading, reading reports about people the people who went to see this movie and why they liked it.
So many people liked it.
Uh, I was struck by how many_ the_ by the differences in what they found attractive about the movie.
A lot of people, especially young people, really liked the love story.
And that's what held the most, uh, for them, that_ the love story between the two main characters.
The young, uh, poor but talented American, played by Leonardo Dicaprio and, uh... He was from the mid- west, and... An upper crust socialite from Philadelphia, who was about to enter a loveless marriage.
And of course, they fall in love, just before the Titanic hits the iceberg, the ship, hits the iceberg and it sinks.
But_ and this love story is what attracted many people.
But... From a_ a number of other people were attracted to... The notion of an era_ the end of an_ uh, a movie portraying the end of an era.
And that's in a way what, Titanic is about.
The old Edwardian era, the era of manners, the era of chivalry, of, uh, of women and children first, which were, good values, which are, you know, values that we admire.
But it was also an age of restriction in which women, could not necessarily marry the men that they chose.
Uh... And things like that.
So there wa- there was an era of good.
Good qualities and bad qualities.
And in a way Titanic marked the passing of this era, because there were many changes that came shortly after the Titanic was sunk.
And, one of the changes, that people refrain from saying that a ship, or something else, was unsinkable or indestructible, that people had this idea_ attitude that technology or the accomplishments of man... Could be, could be made infallible, and indestructible.
And this was shattered, by the destruction of Titanic.
But, one of the other things that people were attracted to, especially Japanese men, and that's one thing that struck me very much, they were attracted to uh_ scenes of people, of men sacrificing their own lives for other people.
Of men giving up their selves and everything they had, so that people they never met, could live.
And, uh, th- this is the thing attracted many, many other people.
Now one could be attracted to one of these things or many of these things.
But I think that element of being me_ being able to be, many things, to many people, many different things, is really essential for a movie that is going to have, a, a broad base of popularity.
And this is why, that movie, I think has become so popular all over the world."
"So... I went to nursing school.
And, uh... The school was based in one of the most modern hospitals in East Africa.
The Nairobi Hospital.
And i went through a lot of experiences, while there.
I had to look after my child, while at the same time studying.
And... Um... Well, i had to look after my child.
I had to go home at four PM every day.
Get my child from my grandmother's.
I had to feed her, wash clothes and, i still had homework to do, and studying to do.
And i had to rush back to college by ten PM it was not very easy.
And we had to go to class for three months first.
Before we ever saw a patient, a real patient in the ward.
So when i first went to the wards, um, we sat in a room and we were given report.
And, that is when it really hit me what i'd let myself in for.
They were talking about all the patients.
And all the illnesses they had.
The ward had thirty-two patients... And sixteen of those were H-I-V Positive.
And i was really scared of people with AIDS.
But... It was too late to turn back.
I was already in the ward.
So the first person i was given to look after, died by the end of the day.
Which is no fault of mine.
But, uh, he was very advanced in his illness.
And, um, it was really scary seeing somebody dying and, somebody so weak on the first day in the wards.
I went on to see many more.
And there were many people with AIDS who went on to live healthy lives despite, having H-I-V.
And, uh, generally it was a very rewarding experience, looking after all those people.
And, um, i made many friends in the hospital.
And, some of them went on to working international hospitals in America, in Europe and, in Saudi Arabia.
And, i'll_ i was hoping to do the same thing.
But my life went a different way.
I already had a child who was in schoo_ who was, going to go to school soon.
I had to look after her.
So, um, really i, i felt grounded by the child.
But, she was my daughter and, i had to look after her, because i had her when i was hardly twenty.
So... Life had to go on.
So, i finished_ i finished my nursing course after three years.
Having worked in several hospitals, and many, many wards, in many conditions.
And, i've been places i had to work alone with no supervision.
And i had to take on the duties of a doctor, or a fully qualified nurse.
But i was all that the community had, at the time and in the place that I was in."
"This summer I went to India, with a friend.
We stayed for, two months.
And we did a lot of travelling around.
In general it was a really good experience to meet the people, and see how they live.
And see their different cultures.
And the clothing, and the food.
Just generally see how everyone in India lives.
We went to Agra, and saw the Taj Mahal.
We also spent a lot of time in Rajasthan.
I did a camel safari, in Jaisalmer.
Which was really good fun.
We slept out in the desert.
And, uh, I had to eat desert food, which was interesting.
We wished to go down to Goa but it was too far really.
So we didn't get that far, because it takes so long to travel on the trains, and buses.
Which are quite an experience in themselves, really.
One thing that surprised me was the animals in the streets.
Because there's cows, and dogs, and, um, animals just wandering in the streets.
And even in and out of shops, which is quite funny really.
I did um, an elephant safari, which is really good fun.
Although a bit uncomfortable, sat on top of an elephant.
And, it was quite amusing when they_ when the elephant took a banana from the stall.
And the, the woman on the fruit stall was very cross, and tried to persuade us to pay for it.
But uh, we couldn't obviously get off our elephant to do that.
So, altogether had a really good time in India, i'd like to go back sometime."
"When i was at college about six years ago, i went to Romania with a big group.
We went to do aid work with young children.
To get there we had to do a lot of our own fund-raising.
Which was quite a challenge.
So i was in charge of all that.
We did um, car washes, car boot sales, and a jumble sale.
So it was, it was, very hard work, but it was worthwhile 'coz we managed to raise all the money that we needed.
We had to pay for our own transport over there.
And also, um, equipment that we needed to take with us.
It took us three days to get there by truck.
So we travelled in by road, through all these countries.
Which was quite uncomfortable, because the truck was very cramped.
And the roof leaked so we got wet, every time it rained.
But it was a good way of seeing all these countries.
Although sometimes we were travelling overnight, so, we, we didn't see them if it was dark.
We spent three weeks there.
Which was really enjoyable.
Got to know a lot of people.
Some people from my course went.
We were mainly doing, renovation work.
There was plumbing, and electrical work, and building.
Because we were actually living in a prison, which was being renovated into a children's home, to use when we'd finished.
So, it was, it was very mixed work.
I hadn't got any skills that were needed, in the renovation.
So i spent a day with each person.
No plumbing and, electrical work, and was a general dog's body really, helping out wherever i could.
A lot of fetching and carrying as well.
Putting scaffolding up and things.
Other groups were helping in the home, that we were living in.
There were other charities, a group of scouts that went out.
And eventually they were, hoping to finish within the year.
I'd like to go back one day and see it finished.
But, uh, it's just difficult getting over there.
But, hopefully i'll see it again.
And see with the children in."
"Simply i'll tell_ this is a story about, the summer, this past summer, and my shopping experience.
I love shopping.
And I love clothes.
And I love to get dressed in all different types of clothing.
I went through a stage of vintage clothing where, I just wore vintage clothing, from fifties, no, yeah, fifties on up.
Um, this summer i, I got_ I acquired four credit cards.
Now being a freshman in college, um, you shouldn't really get credit cards, because they are so tempting.
But I got them, and huhu yeah, i, I thought I could trust myself, but i, you know, I sort of ran them all up.
And one had a thousand dollar limit, and one had a seven hundred and ninety_ seven hundred_ eight hundred dollar limit, another one had a five hundred dollar limit, and the other one had a three hundred dollar limit.
And I think I have all together out of all of them, about sixty dollars.
So, um, i_ in the beginning, I just bought little things like little tickets for, you know, a play here and there, for a party here and there, you know, then one day I just decided to go out and go shopping for summer clothes, because I only had three pairs of shorts.
So... I took my sister and my mother to New York.
And, we had a wonderful day in New York.
And I think I spent about three hundred, four hundred dollars, like two hundred and fifty on clothes and, the rest on food and, you know, little knickknacks.
And now i'm thinking, okay Ebony you're gonna stop now, you have summer clothes, you're okay.
So here's July and I'm buying little gifts for my mother, her_ she's going to be forty-seven this year.
And, um, all these little things.
You know I made a down payment on my first car, off of the credit cards.
So I didn't realize how that_ all that added up.
Um, now here comes August and, i'm thinking okay i'm getting bills.
They're saying eight hundred dollars, and, six hundred dollars and I'm like ""whoa oh my goodness.""  so, uh, you know, I haven't stopped yet, though, because I have them_ I have_ I keep one_ I stopped_ I put, I put two away_ I acquired another one mid- summer, used about three hundred dollars on that one.
And... Um, I had one more that I was still using because it was my A-T and T card, it was also a phone card, so it was very helpful.
Um... But anyway, um.
I finally started using the_ I i_ continue to use to that A-T and T card.
And I saw little sales that I just, you know, I couldn't resist.
They were perfect sales and_ they were really good sales, but I didn't have money.
I was use- I was use- I was using the credit cards, so I finally you know I called one day, I tried to use the A-T and T card and it said ""no.""  and I called them and they said, ""it's been shut off because, you are thirteen dollars over your limit.
I said ""whoa.""  so I said ""okay Ebony, what you must do is to fix this problem now.
You have put yourself in a bind_ you will fix it.
How will you do that.""  um... I talked to one of my doctors actually.
My doctor told me that he did it this he was younger.
He got a loan paid it off in about a year and a half, or a year while he was still in school.
And it was done with.
So that's what I am going to do.
I'm going to get a loan in October, pay them all off, learn from my lesson, and get one later on in life where I can really use it. "
"The Ukrainian system of education is pretty similar to that of the former Soviet Union, because it's origins are in the Soviet Union.
I would like to note, first of all, that the main difference between the Ukrainian system of education and American one, lies in the system of undergraduate education at the universities.
First of all there is no such thing as taking classes and credits and so on.
When students enter_ who enter the university, they choose some particular specialty, some particular areas they would like to work in.
For example, I could, give you some idea about this from my, own experience.
I'm a chemist.
And, I prefer to work in the area of organic chemistry and biochemistry.
When I ert- entered the university in Ukraine, there were several options.
I could become an organic chemist, inorganic chemist, electro-chemist and so on.
There were approximately, ten different areas I could choose from.
I decided to go to organic chemistry.
And there is a certain program assigned to each field.
So, while I'm a student of the first year, I know for sure what courses I'm going to take when I'm_ I'll be a student at the five_ at the fir- fifth year.
There is some certain program, and we have to follow that program in order to receive our diploma.
We should satisfy all the requirements that are assigned by that program.
Well, from one point of view, it's not so good because there is not, nll- not a lot of personal freedom, in taking, those courses and making decisions.
But from a different point of view, it could also be pretty good because, for example, you have to take your math class or you have to take your physics class, and that means that, in, in some sense it's going to, to make your general level much higher that you would have had otherwise.
So that means that every student who receives a diploma from the Ukrainian university, has, has to take physics and mathematics, and so on.
I- which means_ which assures that the general level of the students who finish_ who graduate from the university is reasonably high.
Then, there is a, there is slight difference between graduate programs in the United States and in Ukraine.
When you, graduate from the university and receive your undergraduate degree in Ukraine, you may go for... So called <i>asperantura</i> which is Ukrainian word.
It is, uh, in some sense analogous to the American master's program.
You spend from two to three years.
But you don't have any classes.
You don't take any classes, and the only thing that you are doing, is you're working on your research project.
And when you fini- when you're finished with your research project, you defend it and receive your degree.
Which is, uh, pretty similar to the American master's degree.
And when you're done with that part, you may, apply for doctorate program.
But there is no official program.
You may even, work on your project on your own.
And when you're done with the project, you can present it to the committee and defend it.
And you will receive your degree.
So there is, practically no formal classes to get your, P-H-D in Ukraine.
And it's not called P-H-D, but there's a similar degree.
So, in general, the system is slightly different.
And one point is the difference in undergraduate education.
And another difference is in ah graduate education.
And I would tend to think that, I wouldn't place Ukrainian system of education lower than that of the United States.
It is different but I think it's as efficient as the system in the States."
"Uh, one of the most popular sports around, actually here, especially at the college, is something called ultimate Frisbee.
Or just called ultimate.
And some people have never even heard of it.
It's basically just_ it's a group of people with a Frisbee.
And it's the most natural extrapolation of trying to make a sport out of this.
You take_ you just divide up the group you have.
_ you can play on any field you want.
Uh, usually it's played on something about the size of soccer field, if you've a lot of  people.
But you can play in your back yard.
It doesn't even matter.
You just designate what kind of goals there are.
Just like the end zone in football.
And, um, you have two teaMs  and, one team starts off with the Frisbee.
And the_ there's very few rules.
You just, throw the Frisbee to the other person, on your team.
And if there_ they can run and catch it, they do- they don't have to be stationery when they catch it obviously.
If they're on the run and they catch it, the only thing is, that they have to stop as soon as they can.
They can't_ you can never run with the Frisbee.
There's no_ that's not a possibility at all.
And so, um, some people develop incredible strategies.
They've been able to throw the Frisbee with their backhand, or over their head.
And, uh, the only_ the other rule actually is that, you can't be within three feet of the person throwing the Frisbee, cuz if that_ that's just too close and not giving him the chance.
And you are not allowed to hack at their arMs  if they have the Frisbee you can't try knock it off their hand.
It's, uh, okay if they caught it.
But as soon as the bu-  Frisbee hits the ground, like if i, if I throw it to my team mate he drops it or he just doesn't , or it's just a bad throw and it goes somewhere else.
Then the other team gets it from there and they start to, to move in the other direction.
And, it's just really a really fun sport.
It's a lot of running.
People get really tired and they get really sweaty.
But it's, it's a_ it's a lot of fun, if you can throw the Frisbee straight.
It's really frustrating if it's windy.
It's the only really condition_ I mean, you can theoretically play in the rain, but then you'd slip and probably twist something.
And that's not good.
But it's pretty easy.
(Xx xx) I shouldn't say that it's not easy.
But, people they have, they have patterns like in football.
You can develop plays to run.
And i've se- i've, I have never personally done this, but people, they , they call out like three, and then everyone in the team knows exactly what to do.
And they run off different directions and like end up with the Frisbee.
And it's really_ it's amazing to see it completely organized.
And usually  you don't have to be organized.
It's pretty easy to play.
The way you score points in Frisbee to determine the winner is, obviously, the goal of anything.
Is, uh, you designate an end zone like in, uh, football.
And all you're trying to do is get the Frisbee you don't, you can't throw it in the end zone, you have to have someone to catch in the end zone.
So if they're on the run and they catch it, and they take an extra step into the end zone.
That's not allowed.
It's got to be_ that's the only time you have to be stationary, when you're catching it.
Because you have to, you have to make sure that you have both feet in, just like in football.
You have to have, uh, two feet on the ground.
So if I throw it to my teammate, and he catches it, in the end zone, that's fine.
If he catches it and walks out of the end zone, that's not fine.
If he catches it_ he can even like hit it if he's running out of bounds.
I've seen people hit it out of the air, towards a teammate in bounds and he caught it, and that's completely legal.
And so basically the number of people, who have the number of_ the most number of points in, however long you want to play is the winner."
"As a young child I used to enter a village show every year, with my family.
We all used to enter items of sewing and craft, and cooking.
And it used to take us weeks of preparation.
It used to entertain us during the summer, which probably pleased my parents, 'coz it kept us quiet.
Uh, one year we wanted to make some bread.
Um, there were some children's, classes, and my brother and I made bread out in the garden.
With the help of my mum.
Unfortunately, though, the table collapsed.
And the uh, bread went on the ground, and, uh, had stones in it.
So we picked out the stones, and the little rocks.
And, uh, we decided to still enter it, you know, just for the fun of it.
And, uh, to our great surprise, we got first prize.
Even though, the loaf had to be cut in half, and the judges had to taste it.
So, we were quite pleased with that.
But, uh, we didn't hear any stories of the judges being ill, which was good.
And we were quite pleased, that we won first prize."
"Three years ago I participated in the program Amigos de las Americas which means friends of the Americas.
It's a volunteer organization, based in Houston Texas.
It's similar to the Peace Corps except that it's for shorter time periods, and it's basically targeted, at people in high school or, the early college years.
What it is, is they send out those students who know Spanish or Portuguese depending on what country you go to.
They send them, to different countries in Latin America to do community service work.
They have different_ they have many different projects.
There are many different projects.
They have community sanitation project,s in which the volunteers build latrines and do community service talks.
They also have projects in which volunteers, actually give vaccines to humans.
I think that project is based in Paraguay.
Then, the project I participated in was rabies vaccination, which is in Ecuador.
It's actually, kind of interesting how I decided to participate in this.
At the point in my life at which I went to_ in which I participated in  Amigos I was very interested in human medicine.
So I really wanted to do human vaccinations, which would have meant I would have gone to Paraguay.
But as it turns out that the program was filled and so I had to decide what program I wanted to participate in.
I wa- i, um_ I've also been very interested in animals and loved them my whole life, so going to Ecuador looked good.
But I wasn't still quite sure about that.
But then, since when I was in sixth grade, I did a report on Ecuador and I absolutely fell in love with it, that was what, basically tied the... Knot and made me want to go to Ecuador.
So, I went to Ecuador and I did rabies vaccinations for eight weeks.
We also taught English for a little bit.
And we did many, um,  charales  [a Spanish word] which would be kind of like informational talks, about dental hygiene, sanitation, nutrition.
Um.
We also planted some gardens and did talks about that.
We talked about rabies, the dangers of smoking, and we made a big huge mural with, a lot paintings at the elementary school, and we got to meet a lot of nice people.
That was actually how I met my_ who is now_ the man who is now my husband.
So, i, highly recommend the program but hahaha not really for that reason, but it's a very good program.
Anyone who's interested in going to Latin America, and has a... Strong interest in community service I would definitely recommend that they participate."
"Ok i’ve been living in, Oxford for... Say fifteen years now.
But, i’m not actually born in the_ in this area.
I come from... A place called Wales.
Uh... You may or may not have heard o- of.
I don- do have a bit of a Welsh accent, in fact.
Although it’s not the, traditional Welsh accent.
I come from, I suppose the industrial, east coast of, of or south east coast of Wales which does have a very distinctive accent.
In fact they always say, you know, you have to go to Cardiff, and buy a Mars bar and read the Argus  right.
As, as_ this_ very_ was the way people people take the mickey.
I s'pose out of, people from hehe, my pa- par- part of the world.
It's always those three words.
The Argus, in fact, apart from being a bit of, mythology is actually the name of quite a popular newspaper in Wales.
And Mars bar pre- pre- presumably is world famous.
I don’t know if it’s called something different outside of Britain.
But a Mars bar_ there’s this sort of chocolate bar.
That, uh, has apparently it’s been the same for almost forever.
And you can probably, uh, value things in terms of the number of Mars bars it might take to buy a car.
Uh, and Cardiff of course is the, is the capital of Wales.
So those three together, that’s, why my accent was very strange.
I come from a little town, well a bi- big industrial town in fact called Newport.
Okay, not a very_ its Welsh name is Casnewydd.
Uh, the New Castle.
That’s much nicer.
And it’s actually quite an old place.
It’s got a Norman castle there.
And it’s right on the coast.
Uh, so i, I was actually brought up right next to this big industrial, hehe, river in Wales.
And quite_ till my parents moved outside to a, a little village called Cilyans which is, very nice.
Uh, Cilyans means, um, let’s think, Castle of the Legion.
And in fact the, second Augustine legion was, was stationed there in, in Roman times.
So it’s, it’s a nice little place.
It’s, it’s full of history.
Which, you know, you might gather is the kind of thing that I like.
It has the Roman, lots and lots of Roman remains there.
And in fact it’s quite an important archaeological site.
And then it’s got the kind of, remains of the people who were there before the Romans.
Who are not, that dissimilar to, to the way people are now, in, in fact.
I mean, there_ all right you may have heard about the Romans and the, the Celts fighting it out.
Well this particular Celtic group of people, the Silurians, they actually_ they kind of got along with the Romans really.
And they kind of came to a bit of a deal with them, where the Romans could have the coast, and they, they’d take over the rest.
And, so, so it’s a bit of wheeler, dealing.
In fact, uh, you know, they used to do a lot of horse trading and stuff with the Romans.
And i, I think people where I come from are still, haha, are still quite like that really.
And we’ve got, um, I mean Cylian is a type of place_ we have a very famous writer, or famous me, perhaps, haha, nobody else in the world has ever heard of this guy called Arthur Macken.
Who was actually born in my home village of, of Wales, about, I guess, um, a hundred years ago.
Maybe more than a hundred years ago.
And he used to write lots of, amazing stories about the hills and, ghosts and, uh, spirits and all sorts of strange goings on in, in the area.
So I guess, that, you know most people find me probably a bit, fond of strange thought myself.
And i, I think if you’re born and brought in the area that, that I come from, Cylian and, uh, just outside New Port in Wales.
Then, then you might be a bit strange as well."
"Um, generally i am pretty disillusioned with politics in Britain.
Not in the sense that you know, i am sort of laid back and well, it doesn’t really bother me at all.
Generally i am sort of disillusioned in the sense that i feel that so little of what interests me and a lot of people i know is touched on.
Um, i think the nineties have become a very, very depressing decade for British politics.
The labor party has taken a turn towards desperately wanting to be in office and being willing to do anything to get into office.
Perhaps more fundamentally i think a lot has happened in terms of left-wing politics.
Um, with regard to people feeling the options aren’t there that were there.
And that you have to accept sort of neo-liberal free trade um, scaling down the welfare states sort of society.
Um, and while i think there is a need for change it is very depressing that, um, that the Labour Party doesn’t seem to really have any particular ideas of its own.
They seem to be more willing to accept the ideas of what were their political opponents.
There have been some interesting developments, some positive developments; i think the emergence of the Green Party as an electoral force is interesting.
I think it opens up an awful lot of opportunities and new ideas that need to be there although there can be a certain sort of ludditism element in green politics which would want to change everything that has happened since the industrial revolution and that i don’t think is particularly helpful.
But on the level of, um, stressing the importance of society as a society and as a community.
And the need for mutual links in society i think they are a very positive force.
Also in terms of stressing the dangers of not destroying our environment through over production and not destroying our lives through over producing and always having to be doing more and gaining more.
And rather to try and enjoy things other than that.
Um, particularly coming from Wales.
I think the recent sort of changes in the structure of the political system in Britain in terms of devolution is, is a very positive force.
I think one of the things that has happened with the Labour Party moving as it has done is that it can be said to have sold out a lot on the people who did support it.
In Wales and the north of England and what might be called the sort of labour heartlands.
And they have been taken for granted.
These people will vote for Labour no matter what happens and so well, let’s go off and work out how we can attract people, middle class people in Southeast England as well.
And i think there is an awful lot of dissolution amongst people like that.
And generally Wales votes much more left-wing, um, than Britain generally.
So it is this devolution and having a parliament, no matter how small its powers in Cardiff offers and opportunities for Welsh people to say, 'well, we don’t want things the things the way they are run in Westminster.
You know, we have different priorities.
We think that a common health service for all people is important.
And we think, you know, a better state education system is important.
And we don’t feel we need to sell all our national assets into the private sector.
'Um, so, i hope the um,Welsh assembly in Cardiff will be, give a voice to people in Wales and funnily enough give a voice to the Welsh Labour Party as against the English Labour Party more generally the Labour Party in Westminster."
"Um, the, the subject I did best on when I was, uh, an undergraduate.
At least I got my highest mark in it.
Was a course called Historiography, um, which is basically a, a term which, um, is used for describing the practice of, um, understanding how history is written.
Um, and this sort of course particularly interested me, in that, you are coming at a historical text.
Not from the point of view as, what does this tell us about the reformation.
But more what does this tell us about the person who wrote it.
Um, and i, it is fascinating to, to pick up something which is, ostensibly about the reformation,  and to try and work out the various ways in which you can, um, look at the author, and at his society and at, um, how he related to, um, the past tradition of wr- wr-writing history.
And also, his contemporary situation.
Um, essentially this_ it, it is looking at a, a, a, work of history more as, um, you could say, look at a, a, uh, a work of um_  the, the main, the main sort of, um, areas, um,which you can look at is in terms of, looking at the work in terms of a, a literary piece of work.
And, uh, the sort of forms and conventions that it uses.
And, um, also, looking at the sort of underlying, um, sort of social theoretical aspects.
How, uh, how the author view society.
How the author views people as working.
How the,the author sees areas of soc_ society as inter reacting.
And, um, sort of to take the work, and to pick out the sort of, um, models he uses.
And sort of assumptions he has about the way people are.
And the way society is.
Um, and i, I found that aspect absolutely fascinating.
And, um... I, I fo_ it was somewhat depressing, the extent to which i, I found that the, the course I was doing fascinating as it was, really didn’t reflect, the sort of scholarship that was going on.
And the sort of, uh, movements in Historiography have developed immensely in the last thirty years.
And, um, that the year I was born, 1974, um, one of the most notable works came out.
It is a volume called Metahistories by Hayden White who has been a professor in California.
And that work, even though at the time I was studying history was, twenty-one years old and extremely_ highly regarded in, um, in American universities and British universities wasn’t actually on the course.
Let alone you know,more recent writers who, um, who have, you know, criticized, Hayden White, developed what he has to say, interacted, you know, with the, the, the whole intellectual history of the, the twenty years since.
None of that was on it.
There was a tendency, um, to, um, to rely on a certain tradition of British, um, writing about Historiography.
That was, that was somewhat depressing coming out of it and then realising there was a whole sort of, whole, um, new area that I hadn’t really managed to get into.
Um, and coming to Oxford wasn’t really a help.
Um, I sort of actually discovered this more threw people who were working in departments of English, than people who were in de_  you know, supposedly prestigious department of history in Oxford.
I a- amusingly found that there wasn’t a single copy of Hayden White’s work in the history faculty library in Oxford.
Yet, when I went to, um, the university library in Brno.
So when I went to Brno I sort of, well perhaps not amazingly found that, um, in a Czech library in, you know, a country where... Books from, you know, academic books are expensive commodities and hard to come by, um, and they, they really have to pick and choose about what they can afford to buy.
I found a copy of, of Hayden White available in the university library.
Yet you, you couldn’t get on in the, the history faculty in Oxford.
Um, so, it is somewhat depressing about the, the lack of... Sort of cutting edge, um, intellectual thought in, in a supposedly eminent university."
"Frequently I'm asked,""wh- what do you think is important to be successful in business.""  and, depending on, who is asking the question, um, it could be several different things that I think are of value, and you should do.
But to start with something that might appear, or sound to be very basic.
I really do believe that this is very pertinent as far as being successful in business.
And that is, you really do need to stay up on current events.
You need to know what is going on in your world.
You need to know what your competition is doing, better than they know.
And it is very easy to find, all of this information, um, just by researching it, going to a library.
But... When I say you need to keep, up on current events.
What I am really suggesting is, taking the time to read the newspapers.
And taking in the right newspapers.
And taking the time to listen to, uh, business interviews on the television or on the radio.
You really need to have, a, a, thirst for information.
But you have to be very selective about the information, that you do feed yourself, and that you are looking for.
Um, because we all know with... Information today, everybody talks about information overload.
And there is no question that, it can be very intimidating, and frightening to think about, all the information that you have access to.
But if you are looking to go into business.
Again you have to be very careful and particular about the type of, information that you spend your time in reading and learning and getting to know about.
Uh, an example might be, um, if you wanted to publish a book.
Well_ or you, know that you enjoy writing, or maybe you don't even enjoy writing, maybe you just have an idea that would make, a great story line for a book.
Well, wh- where would you go.
What would you do.
Well one of the things  you might want to do is research that particular theme or area.
And find out what is already in the market place, uh, in that particular, uh, in t- subject that you're wanting to, to write or publish in.
So, um_ and again it is just knowing your audience, doing your homework.
And I think too by staying, informed, looking at what future trends are.
Um, there are great opportunities to, know what might be an opportunity, for a, a business opportunity.
Just a- again by reading particular newspapers, periodicals.
Uh, listening to the right kind of business shows and marketing shows.
And I just cannot stress the importance and the value, of staying informed and taking the time, to study, and to be an expert, in whatever it is that you want to do for a business.
You must be the expert.
And you must learn and know that subject.
And again that area, better then any one else.
Um, and don't try to be an expert in all things.
Most  businesses fail I believe, because the person in business is trying to do everything.
They are trying to, do their financing and trying to select a location, perhaps, to do their business.
Um, and they are trying to keeping up with all of the legal, um, things that must be done to incorporate a business.
And rather than focusing on what their expertise is.
There are plenty of people available, both through the government and through, um, nonprofit organizations that can help, you take care of those details.
But remember you are the expert in whatever it is that your dream is, and your passion is, and that is what you should focus on.
And know better than everyone else.
And, uh, I think you will find if you do some of these things, that you will find it to be very helpful to you.
And perhaps you will be successful in business too."
"Why did I do a maths degree.
Uh, by accident really.
Um... I had this big family reputation, as a people person.
And I didn't really want to be defined as a people person.
It sounded far too fluffy.
And, I felt, that it would just be amusing, ha ha, when I discovered that maths, was less hard than I'd anticipated.
'Cos I did quite well in my exaMs  so... I swapped it to do maths really, just to kind of surprise, and startle my family.
Ha ha.
It worked.
Ha ha.
It was a bit of a mistake when I got there.
I got the degree.
Um, I do like maths, but then I do like, almost everything.
So, that wasn't necessarily a good enough reason.
Um, I like maths because there's a right answer.
What I'd got accepted for_ to do at university, was economic and social history.
And there's no right answers.
You always feel like you're going to be wrong.
You can always completely rewrite the essay.
You can always take, the opposing point of view.
When you've finished a maths problem, you've got the right answer.
That's it, you can go to the pub.
You're done.
Ha ha.
That's a_ that's very... Very reassuring, actually.
Um, and there's no background reading, so you have more time, anyway, to play around, and enjoy being a student.
Um, there's also stuff about, how beautiful maths is.
But, unless you can see that, in the first place, you_ it's, it's not explainable.
It's, you know, a matter of taste like, whether or not you think that a certain kind of dress is pretty.
You know, sometimes I would_ even in my incredibly cynical, half-hearted way of doing a maths degree, I would sit there in a middle of a lecture, losing my place, and the notes I was taking just going, 'wow, that's, beautiful.'"
"I'm not learning to speak German.
I feel I should be.
It's my mother's first language, and, she met my father when she came to England, uh, to try and, brush up on her English.
Um, and he taught her, and then they got married.
It's very sweet.
And they didn't bring us up bilingual, me and my brother.
They, thought about it.
And they thought how nice it would be for us, to have a second language, and be able to speak to all members of our family, properly.
But, they didn't for two reasons.
One, was because they were terribly afraid that we might not get a proper command of both languages.
If we didn't lay them down at the same_ you know, if we'd laid them down at the same time.
And, in fact, we do know a Danish and English family, where, the younger son, continued mixing up the languages, into secondary school.
Which is eleven, twelve.
Which must have been a bit difficult for him, really.
So, I suppose I'm glad about that, that, that didn't happen to me.
But_ ha ha.
The other reason was because, my mother's Swiss, and Swiss-German is, a very different, kind of dialect, from German-German.
And, she didn't feel that teaching me Swiss-German, was really a very valuable thing to do.
Because, nobody speaks Swiss-German, and then I'd sound like I was Swiss-German, instead of having useful German.
And she couldn't speak to her own baby in high German, because, that would be like talking Chaucer.
It would just be completely bizarre.
So, they didn't bring us up bilingual.
I did study German at school.
And i, f- understood it very well, very quickly.
I think i_ because my parents would talk in German to each other to keep a secret from us.
My brother and I both got very adept at learning_ particularly German relating to television, sweets, hidden toys, haha, things of that nature.
Um, and so we were_ both found it quite easy to pick up.
But I couldn't actually bring myself to a_ really, really learn.
Because, I felt that I shouldn't have to put in any effort.
'Cos I could have got this for free, by being brought up bilingual.
You know, it could have been no effort whatsoever.
And so I sort of resent making the effort.
I do want to learn Japanese.
And I keep petering out, because I feel guilty.
I, I should learn German first, because I've got whole family members that I can_ can't really speak to properly, because I don't speak German.
It's a bit of a problem really.
I think I'm going to end up being, just a typical English person, who only speaks English."
"Why do I like math.
Uh, there are many many reasons why I like math.
Um, some of which may seem bizarre or odd to most people.
And, uh, that's why I i hesitate to talk about stuff like this.
But, uh, I feel that if I'm going to be a math teacher, then everyone should know.
Um, math is all around you.
If you look anywhere you go, you're going to see math.
Um, just as... If you_ when you're walking down your sidewalk, and you're going to school or, if you're going to your job, you're always going to have math in your life.
Uh, if you have bills to pay, you're going to have math there.
You're going to have to figure out how to work with numbers.
Um, and beyond that, uh, you can just look at anything in your house, uh, your TV your computer, uh, the radio that you listen to, uh, the computer that you're on right now, you_ you're dealing with binary systems, and you're dealing with quadratics.
And you're dealing with, all kinds of math, that you may think is silly, or some of you may not, but most people think it's silly or too difficult, or not important later on in life.
Um, but you wouldn't have a lot of things that you do have now.
Even beyond technology and what you're using, uh, you can look in nature, look at your flowers and the, the shape that everything is, uh, set up in, um, that's all geometry.
Uh why_ there's a reason why you have only three leaf clovers and it's rare to have a four leaf clovers.
There's reasons why stars and galaxies are set up the way they are.
It's all_ b_ it can be explained with math.
So anything along those lines_ um, you could think of many many more.
That is why math to me, is one of the more interesting subjects, because everywhere you go, you could use math or find math or be involved with math.
So that is why math to me is, an interesting subject and one that everyone should be involved with."
" now that i'm here, in America to study politics.
Um, i feel like i need to know... About America much better than, um, the knowledge that i had before.
I feel a need to go deep down into studying the society structure, about the people, and what have brought them there, what have made them the American people.
Um... As opposed to, the French people, the Vietnamese people.
So um, i had uh, a good time, talking with, um, my friends in general about America.
But um, nothing that i've been told, um, should be acknowledged, or applied to the_ that's what i think.
And i should really have some, hands on experience, and to learn about America myself, to learn about the people, to have some kind of manifestation exposed to me.
Um, just so i can believe in what i see in_ I have a more (urban) analytical point of view about, um, America in general.
And one of the reasons i think should learn more about America is that, um, it's a very special country.
Um, i don't think any other countries in the world are like America, in almost every sense.
And the poep- the population in America, um is composed of so many people from so many different parts of the world, of so many different races.
And, um, that has made the American culture in general to be so much more diverse than, the culture of any other countries that i've know of.
And from that cultural point also develops into um ... Uh different... Other things like American cuisine, the languages, and how um, uh, how people respect each others' background, uh, regardless of many other things which is a little bit, you know, um, off topic.
And um... Another thing about America is the the structure of the government and of the society.
I think unlike in Vietnam, when um... The government um, has the possession of um almost everything.
And America most of everything truly belong to, um, the people in general.
And um, in that sense, i mean the people are classified into, vari_ various groups.
And um... Um, how much they possess has something to do with how much they earn, how much they make, and how much they know how to manipulate their capital, um, earnings and investment in general.
So um, the structure of the government in America is truly um, a reflection of that.
And the government is, um, actually an instrument in the hands of the people, and that is acting very much accordingly to what the public requires it to do.
And um, i'm reading this book about American government.
And um, it's very interesting how the constitution of America was set up in the first place.
Um, there is a term of the framer_ and um, to call the very first, um, say the pioneers in the process of setting up, uh, an appropriate constitution for America, they had like, you know, forty-fifty... Some of them.
And they are supposed to be the fathers of America, um, because they set up the frame of the government, they set up frame of the country, and of the states.
And they defined what kind of power the federal state, which is the one, um, conducting the business in all fifty states of America, and also in uh the government... The pow- the kind of power the state government has and, um, is restricted to.
And um, it's very good to see that different branches of the government, in America has the right and the power, to check and to control, other branches of the government, which is something that, um,  is not the same in Vietnam where i come from.
And the people really have the power, um, not only nominal like, um, you would see in Vietnam or the former Soviet Union or China.
But um, for example, if you want to walk in and see the senator from your state, you can just set up an appointment and go in.
Which is not like in, Vietnam where if you want to see the leader, um, you have, you have to have a very good reason otherwise you cannot see him at all.
So um, i think learning more about American... Structure of government and society in general is gonna, help me with, um, my political career later on when i get back to Vietnam.
Um, socially, there are a lot of things about America that, um,are not, good, are not positive.
But um, a lot of good things are there and um, i would like to, see what the good things are, and see whether they would be appropriate for Vietnam.
And then just, took them in, just take them in and see how, the the people's lives can be made, into um, something better with those values that um, are so treasured here in America. "
"Once I was a_ a confirmed caving club member, and went very often.
We went off, maybe, every couple of weeks.
We would all go, on a weekend trip, to somewhere they have good caves.
Because, most of the caves in Devon, where I lived at the time, are, muddy, but not properly watery.
And a bit dull.
One of the places where they have good caves, is around Cheddar Gorge.
There are some famous caves that, touristy people can walk into, wearing their high heels.
And they go along their little concrete path, and it's all lit up, and it's very nice.
And you buy tickets, and a guide will show you, stalactites, and stalagmites, and, and, you can go 'ooh.
' And then come out to the tea shop.
And, that's fine if you like that sort of thing.
But, if you know how to do proper caving with a wet suit, and muddy boots.
And squeezing through really tight places.
This is really, you know, it's not hard, basically.
There are a lot of other good caves around there though.
That the public can't get to very easily.
And, in one of these caves, we decided to take a trip in, as far as we could go, including a sump.
A sump is when, the water, has filled a little passage, from one room_ sort of one cavern to the next.
Um, which means that the_ the little passage linking the two, is down low.
And makes a sort of like a 'U' shape, and this can fill up with water.
So, that when you're standing in the first room, it looks as if there's a puddle in the corner.
But if you hold your breath, and go down and under, you can come up into another room.
It's a very strange experience, and one of the people in the team was, not up for it, and just stayed behind, quietly smoking in the cave.
And thinking, how rebellious they were to be smoking in a natural beauty place.
Um, I was, very tempted to stay behind, and do the same.
But in the end my desire to macho, won out, over my desire to be a rebel.
So, i, uh, went down the sump.
And it was absolutely terrifying.
There was a piece of string to lead you through.
But, because I dithered for so long_ you really did need the string.
You couldn't see, the water had been completely churned up, and was full of mud.
So,  it was very thin mud, I was diving through.
And the whole of me was submerged at once.
I mean, it was quite a long, little leap from room to room.
But when I came out the other side, my headlamp, reflected on something that had been brought down by someone, before us.
It was a road sign, that they had stolen, from the side of the road.
Presumably, about over where we were.
Saying, 'Wookey Hole, one and a half miles.
Avoiding city centre'."
"Um, as well as, um, doing the teaching.
Um, I've also, particularly in the last two years, um, I've been working for, Oxford University Press.
Um, for a project which is called the Dictionary of National Biography.
Um, first edition of this dictionary was published in the 1890s.
It's about twenty volumes long.
Um, and it's been added to by various, sort of volumes of missing persons and, um, by decade volumes.
Every decade this century for people who've died during that decade.
Um, the original idea with it was to have, a sort of reference tool for people who wanted to look up somebody who was a a bishop or a writer.
But not necessarily so famous that, um, a, a whole biography of them had been published.
Um, so each entry is maybe a page long.
Um, can be in, in the case of you know prime minister or, uh, you know, a, a famous writer, it could be considerably longer.
Um, so there is this, this dictionary published in the 1890s and, um, obviously it's beginning to get a bit dated, in the, so_ sort of main sections that, um, perhaps you know a hundred years of, of scholarship and publications has, um, added to what we know.
Um, there is also the, the secondary point that, um, it was produced in the eighteen nineties.
It doesn't have very many women in.
It doesn't have very many people who are, you know, let's say what you might call working class leaders, or, um,you know, who are away from the general sort of, generals, bishops, um, politicians, themes of the earlier one.
So, it's been decided to do a whole, um, a whole new edition.
A second edition.
So, this, um, second edition is, um, in preparation obviously, um, uh, the, uh, it- it's difficult to, um, sort of organise all these contributions.
Most of them come from, you know_ they are sent out to people who are experts in that particular field.
Obviously, there's some, some historian is, is the expert on, seventh-century church.
He gets a huge wad of seventh century bishops.
Um, what i- happens a lot of the time is there's people that, um, there's nobody who's particularly an expert in them.
Um, and in my position this is- well, these ones sort of come to me on the_ on a contract basis.
So i_ i, you know, somebody comes to me and says, you know, can you, um, write on, you know, this seventeenth century, um, hagiographer.
So, a sort of a person who wrote, um, histories of saints.
So I say yes I think I can manage a hagiographer.
And, you know off I go, into the library and try and dig out what I can on them, and, and write my entry.
Um, 've done all sorts of entries.
I've, I've done from, uh, fifteenth century bishop to, um, a twentieth century doctor.
Um, mostly I've been working on the what's the, uh, called the early modern period.
The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Um, that's just because it's happened in, in the last couple of years.
Since I've finished my degree that's been the section they've been working on.
So, um, I've been having a go at those, um.
It- it's interesting i- it it can_ it has a certain appeal in, that sort of somebody who's totally obscure, um, living in the sixteenth century, was perhaps a famous person in their day, um, but now is, is, is extremely unregarded.
And i- it can be fascinating to go off and see what you can dig up about them.
And, um, there's a sort of, um, fascination in that but i- it- it can be immensely dull, immensely tedious.
Um unrewarding, um, but, you know, there's worse things I could be doing"
"When I finished my A-levels, at uh the age of eighteen, I went onto a care course.
And even from that age, I realised that I wanted to work with old people.
I feel very natural working with them.
And I just seem to click, and understand their needs, more than some people.
I've had a lot of experience working with old people in nursing homes, and day centres.
A lot of people with Alzheimer's and dementia, which I find really interesting.
I enjoy doing activities with them.
In the day centre we used to do, um, art and craft, uh_ in the day centre we used to do art and craft lessons.
And reminiscence groups, which I found really interesting.
The way they, they come out with different stories of their school days.
And when they got married, or when they met their partner.
Also brings back a lot of memories that can be sad and happy.
We used to go on trips.
We've been to the beach, and out for picnics, and shopping trips.
Which is always quite enjoyable.
Especially when they, enjoy it, as much as we do.
When I was younger I had a lot of contact with old people.
I used to, live right near my grandparents, which was good, because we used to get on really well.
It was like having an extra mom and dad that used to treat us.
And give us presents, and sweets and things.
Uh, most people on my social work course, want to work with children.
But, I've never, been interested in working with children.
And I've always enjoyed working with old people.
And that's probably where I'll stay."
"Biochemistry is a very specific area of chemical science which, studies the interactions of biological systems with chemical components, and which also determines, which chemical components and, how interacts with the human body and with all the biological chem- systems in general.
First of all, the purpose of biochemistry is to find out which chemicals in particular and, how interact with particular systems in_ inside the human body and how they effect its functions.
Another area of biochemistry is the, the, is the determination of the way to effect functions of the, of the body.
And in particular we can, we can say that biochemistry is the whole foundation of the pharmaceutical industry because, all the drugs that we have on the market are derived as chemical components.
And the purpose of biochemistry is to determine, whether some, component is going to be active or not.
And is it going to be, efficient or not, and if it's, if it's going to affect some biological functions or not.
Therefore biochemistry right now is very rapidly developing area.
Because there is a high demand, for efficient and quickly, acting chemicals and quickly acting drugs.
We can see that there is a lot of viruses and a lot of... Diseases which are being_ which are developed at this particular time.
And therefore there is a high demand for new efficient agents.
And one area of biochemistry which is of a particular interest is computer based analysis of chemical components, and computer based design of drug, agents.
It has been proven that computer based design could be particularly efficient for the design of, of anti-viral components.
And, at this point there is a lot of research going on, in particular in the United States, that promised, that, there will be, many, chemical compounds discovered in the nearest future.
Because this approach, has very high potential for this kind of application."
"During my third year at Wellesley College I actually went abroad to  Aix-en-Provence France.
The Aix-en-Provence is a very small college town in the, the South of France.
It is a very lovely town.
And, um, I went there actually to study French.
Not only French language and literature, but also French politics.
In fact I took classes at the, uh, University of Provence and also at the Institute of Political Science located in this town.
I had a fantastic experience.
In fact first of all i, uh, went to Paris for about six weeks before I went to Aix-en-Provence.
And this was part of the, uh, junior abroad program.
First we went to Paris actually to, um, to, um, get accustomed to French French life and Fr- French culture.
I went there for six weeks and I took some classes, and it was wonderful.
I had a wonderful experience in Paris which I think is one of the most beautiful cities, if not the most beautiful city in the world.
I went all over the place in Paris.
I visited all the very famous, beautiful museums the Louvre the, uh, Musee- uh, the Rodin Museum and I of course saw the Eiffel Tower.
And I uh, went all over, and I had a fantastic experience.
It certainly improved my French, my spoken French.
And also my, uh, written French.
I also got to, um, understand and apply what I had previously learned in the classroom.
And, um, I also got to see, um, a lot and understand a lot of_ a lot about French culture.
And, uh, it was a fantastic experience for me.
Uh, after those six weeks in Paris I went_ I then went with my group of Wellesley College to the South of France.
We, uh, went to Aix-en-Provence and then I started taking classes at these two universities which I had mentioned earlier.
I took a variety of classes.
And_ in linguistics, uh, French literature of all periods and, um, also, uh, French politics, um, F- Fr- international law and, um, I learned quite a bit from my experiences.
Um, actually these courses were all a yearlong and they met several times a week.
I found that the course load actually wasn't too heavy.
Uh, of course the courses were all in French.
None of them were conducted in English.
They were all conducted in French.
All the wor- work was in French, they all taught by French professors at these universities.
And I found that, um, actually there are quite a few people who were studying abroad at the time as well.
Quite a few people who are from the United States, and from other European countries.
Even other people from, uh, Asia as well studying at these universities.
I’d say this pr_ the- these schools were pretty much very, uh, international oriented.
A lot of international students so... I had_ actually I had the opportunity to meet to meet people from all over the world there, not just French people.
And during my time there i, um, actually, I actually didn't live with a French family, though maybe I should have.
I had a roommate who was American, and it was a rule actually of this program that we had to speak French at all times, and we did.
We stuck to this rule and that's, that’s how we were actually able to improve our French.
And fortunately enough I had the opportunity to visit many different parts of France besides Paris.
Besides, uh, Aix-en-Provence, also I visited Nice, very beautiful, the beaches of Nice are gorgeous actually,  just like from a dream.
And also Avignon and, um, uh, the, and really throughout_ I went through the South of France.
Many parts of the South of France.
And also I went to Italy.
I saw Rome, Florence, Venice.
Italy is also an incredibly beautiful country.
In fact I think, um, Italy is basically alongside France, uh, the two, the two most beautiful countries in Europe in my opinion.
And I had some incredible adventures in Italy.
And Italian men are rather_ they are rather notorious for their v- for, for their exploits and they didn't prove me wrong when I went there.
They fulfilled all my expectations I would say.
And I of course also got to see Austria, Vienna, the city of music.
It’s very lovely and, um, Munich where actually I visited my_ one of my best friends in, in Munich.
A very beautiful city.
And I found that the Italians were above all the friendliest of of, um, any other Europeans.
And Germans were actually pretty friendly too I thought.
I thought that actually, perhaps the French were among the the least friendliest but you know, I still had a a a wonderful wonderful time there.
And, uh, after I came back from that year in France I felt a little disoriented because after I had spoken French a whole year.
And I hadn't spoken English for a whole year.
So I felt a little strange coming back, coming back to the U-S actually.
And, um, I had a fantastic experience there.
Luckily enough I got to make some French friends, with whom I still correspond.
In fact, in fact we write each other regularly, and uh, next time I got to France I i hope to see them once again.
I also, um, had the opportunity to go to France on my honeymoon.
Actually my honeymoon was about six or seven months ago.
I got to go to Paris, uh, for about two weeks.
And I went all over the place.
I went to the various sites which i, which I had missed the first time.
Such as er the beautiful church Sacré Cœur and, um, many other places I had missed the other time.
And Paris was just as beautiful it was the first time that I went, when I was about nineteen.
And, um, yes actually I am looking forward to going to France again for the, uh, third time.
Hopefully it won't be, um, too far into the future.
And, uh, just to sum up.
I I believe that for my junior abroad I learned a considerable amount.
I would certainly encourage all students to, to actually take a year or a couple of years off to visit another country, or several countries.
I think you definitely get a different perspective on life.
I think you grow.
You grow very much emotionally and, um, become more mature.
And you definitely get to, to understand people of different cultures and, and you become more aware of what is going on in the world.
I think you be- begin to look at your own society, think about it and question, what is- what is good, what is bad.
And see if anything could be better.
And it just opens up your mind in so many ways and it was definitely well worth it.
I very much loved my time in France and, uh.
So much looking forward to going back there again."
"Concerning Asian political participation in California and in Hawaii, uh, it appears that Asian political participation, is far greater in, in the_ in Hawaii than it is in the golden state.
By political participation I mean the, uh, percentage of Asians with_ who vote in California versus those who vote in Hawaii.
And also the number of elected o- officials in these two states.
Now it appears that actually in Hawaii, the majority of elect- officials are actually of Asian descent.
Whereas in California, they constitute the, the minority.
Uh, in fact in, um, in Hawaii they’ve had qu- quite a few successes, whereas in California far fewer.
Yes it i- it is true that they, they’ve had, they’ve had they have had several elected Asian officials such as councilman Woo, and also Congressman mi_ Mineta.
But otherwise Asians in the golden state have not had as much success versus, um, their_ versus other Asians in in Hawaii.
There may be very_ there m- may be several different reasons for this.
First of all, uh, there is a fear of inter-minority competition.
Now according to this theory, uh, the reason for, um, this disparity may be that members of different minority groups actually competed with each other for political seats.
So let's say in Hawaii actually, uh, Asians constitute over fifty percent of the populace in that state.
Now since they constitute the clear majority, uh, just, um, due to sheer number they would have a great_ political advantage over other minority groups.
And this would in fact place them at a greater, um, advantage also for obtaining, uh, uh, seats in the government.
Uh, in contrast in the golden state, there are far few Asians in the population, in fact they constitute approximately ten per cent of the population in California.
This figure is of course growing, every year, at a very rapid rate.
But it is still around ten percent a- at the moment.
So i- by constituting a clear minority, eh, they have a greater disadvantage for for such seats.
And they also must compete with i- other minorities.
For example Blacks and Latinos for political seats.
And thus, according to the theory of inter-minority competition, um, they would have le- less of a chance of being elected to office.
Um, Asia- Asian- Americans or Asians, uh, people of Asian-American_ of Asian descent.
However this theory may not totally explain this this gre- great disparity between,um, the participation of Asians in California versus that of, Asians in Hawaii.
And I think that there may actually be m- many other factors which are at play here.
Uh, for example, um there is the phenomenon of the drop in the bucket.
In economics there is such a phenomenon.
And you can also look at this from a political standpoint as well.
For example, be- be_ just, just because Asians in ca_ Hawaii constitute the clear majority, uh, voting for an elected official in Hawaii is_ when someone of us_ elected official in Hawaii, the populace may actually feel much more encouraged to vote.
There is much higher voter registration there in Hawaii, than in California.
Uh, because after all they may feel that, um, their votes actually are worth much more.
Because they have a greater chance of electing an Asian official.
However in California, the, um, Asian populace there may feel that their votes may constitute a drop in a bucket.
This may be because they feel that they'r no_ they're outnumbered by other other people in the populace.
By other people who may not vote for the Asian official.
And thus they may feel that their votes are, are worthless and they may not vote at all.
So the- they are very much discouraged from from, uh, registering to vote, and they may be somewhat indifferent because they feel that, um, they may not be effective.
And another reason is actually that in Hawaii the people of, uh, Oriental descent in Hawaii, actually have, um, lived in Hawaii for generations.
Whereas the Asians in California, many of them are recent immigrants, or more so in fact.
And this also very important in terms of the levels of so_ political sophistication.
In Hawaii the_ there isn't really as much of a problem with the language barrier.
Whereas in California it may be a much greater factor.
And, um, also the, uh, people of Oriental descent in Hawaii, they understand the culture m-more and they_ there are more registered vo-voters in Hawaii.
More registered vo- voters of Oriental descent in Hawaii than there are in California.
So, just in terms of, um, their participation in the political process by voting... Its_ there's a substantial number in California.
Um, su- such a number of people in California of Asian descent ,who are not even registered to vote in the first place.
Um, another factor is that, uh, many of the, uh, people of Asian descent in California_ not only are they a foreign born population.
But they're also more inclined to actually keep up with the politics in their respective ho- native countries, than in the United States.
In Hawaii there's also the factor that the Asians in Hawaii are actually more united politically.
In fact Hawaii is basically a democratic state.
Whereas in California, um, the, uh, the Asians, Asian-Americans are divided along party lines.
There are some who are democrats.
But there are others who are republicans.
They don- they don't have, uh, they’re, they're not very united and that also, um, decreases their political clout.
However there may still be hope.
Because actually Asian of Asians constitute the, uh, fastest growing segment of the U-S population.
Greater than than the Lat_ their_ in fact their numbers are increasing, uh, faster than those of L- Latinos or of Blacks in the United States.
And, um, Asians, and Asian-Americans in fact are also strong in terms of their campaign contributions.
Uh, though there are far fewer who vote and far fewer who, get involved politically or run for office.
They, they never- nevertheless do exer- exert some power in terms of their contributions to campaign.
So there, there may be, um, some prospects for the future.
However, in order for Asians in, um, in California to, to exert more power in the political process.
They would probably have to do several things.
First of all they need wi_ they to, um, they need to align themselves with other, um, minority groups.
Possibly with Blacks, Latinos, on certain core issues.
And then this would, um, this would give them greater political power.
For example, uh, for example if you look at the statistics, if you couldn't_ if you look at the amount of_ the number of representative Asians, Latinos and Blacks in the population in California.
If you combine them, they will constitute greater than half of the population in California.
Now if Blacks, Latinos and Asians were to combine in some sort of a rainbow co- coalition, then, um, they could possibly, they could possibly pass some laws which would be beneficial to, to their groups,or, whatever the the case may be.
They would then constitute the majority.
And they would have much more political power than they would individually.
Another thing is that they really need to, um, to develop some sort of pan_ pan-Asian ethnicity.
Because at the moment they_ Asians are a very heterogeneous group.
Not only in terms of language and culture.
But also in terms of economic and political interests.
For example, people from China or Japan or or Vietnam, they consider themselves very ethnically different, uh, communication barriers there_ and there are also many other, cultural and economic barriers.
And in order for Asians... In order for Asians to have more political clout, they really need to, um, unite.
However, even if_ even in the case that Asians do unite, um and form sort of, form th- form some sort of pan-Asian ethnicity.
It is still very probable that Asians in California or even throughout the U-S as a whole_ that they would not have the same sort of power politically as the_ as do the Asians in Hawaii.
Now this is really due to just a sheer number.
Um, and also just the fact that the Asians in... In Hawaii, um, just are just more united in general.
Um, and, and Asians in Hawaii do constitute fi- fis- fifty per cent of the population in Hawaii and that in itself is, um, a major factor at play.
Which is just not the case in California, probably even with the, uh, growing percentage of Asians in California it may not be the case in California, for, um, for a while."
"As for politics I'll admit, I can't say much.
Uh, I never really got into the whole idea.
It just seemed_ it seemed, kind of contrived in a way.
The whole idea that, you have other people making policies that are supposed, that are supposed to, uh, meet up with everyone's expectations.
But everyone, especially in this country, it completes the melting pot.
And you have tons of people with different, different values and different ideals, and they all want, they all want different things and all pull_ the same guys in the same directions_ in different directions.
And you_ and tha- and they get mad that they don't, get on their exact policy which may or may not_ it doesn't always affect other people.
But this_ even so, it's just, the whole idea that there're so many different groups around, and they're all log rolling and, uh_ and they're, uh, I can't think of the word_ when they give the guys money.
I can't think of the word.
Lobbying, there it is.
Um, and it just_ it just seems that_ and then cuz the_  it's really just, you have the politicians out there and they want to_ they theoretically want to, like the Mister Smith goes to Washington kind of guy.
He wants to make, the country a better place.
Which is, what_ that's what you want them to be working on.
But the half the time they're, answering letters or responding to accusations that they're not, not friendly enough to, like, this group or the_ they're waste_they're, they're, huh, they're just_ they're taking bribes or whatever they are doing.
But they are not, out there thinking of great policies.
They are not out there convincing the corporate people of America, who's the people_ because since we're so corporated, basically those are the targets that politicians, n- need to swing in their favor, if they want to get, anything done.
But they're, they're too busy doing other stuff.
And it's really_ it's almost just like a shame.
Because they have a couple of years in office, and you expect so much of them.
Especially the higher up they go, the more you want to get done.
Uh, like especially like, in the low level, say my ma- ma- uh, the mayoral office of my town, I can't say I've noticed, any change at all.
I means_ I think they paved the street or something.
That's great.
That's nice.
I mean now_ they might've passed a policy to raise or lower the tax.
But it_ they're really not doing anything else because, they're all so con- they're so con- concerned about their own future.
And it's not like you can, go to a store and say, ""oh do you need a politician to work here.""  and so they're really concerned about covering their hides.
They gotta make sure that they have a clean record.
In any a kind of, in any kind of office so that you can hopefully advance, to more and more powerful positions.
And so they're too busy, worrying about themselves to actually go out there.
And, it always seems that the movies that they make these days, the- um, they're getting very political I think.
And, uh, but they are always about the guy who doesn't ca- who like stops caring about himself, and starts going after, you know, going for the goals.
Going for the real justice, and things like that.
But we never _ I haven't, I haven't seen anyone of those people in real life yet.
I mean those are the idealized people, we all agree that, that's the ideal.
And we still pressure them in various ways, and prevent them, and almost scare them f- from_ for going out on the limb.
Because it seems that if they go out on a limb, they can get a black eye, in the public's eye.
And then, hehe, and then they wouldn't_ this would have almost like no future later because the nex- cuz  there's always someone running against you.
The next time they go to an election they would be like_ the opposition would be, ""well he's the guy who did that"" and then the people would be like ""oh yeah he is the bad_  he's a bad guy now.""  and they play up on that.
And, just because we're taking a risk they're not gonna have a chance to do_ like maybe they want to do more things even, even_ risks are good.
I think, uh, Thomas Jefferson said when he made the Declaration of Independence.
He thought a revolution every twenty years would be pretty healthy for the country.
And that hasn't happened at all.
But I mean I completely see where he's going_ coming from.
And just the lack of ability, for the politicians, and flexibility in the in the public eye, gives them, uh, almost no chance, I think, to really go out there and try to make a difference.
Because it's just_ it's too much."
"Britain's unwritten constitution.
Famously, Britain has an unwritten constitution, in contrast with most other countries.
At least that's a clich- that's the cliche.
In fact, um, most of the constitution is not, unwritten at all.
Um, it's largely a myth, that Britain has an unwritten constitution.
Um, it's just not written down in a single document, which you can go out and buy.
You can go out and buy a copy of the American or French constitution if you want to.
But I don't think many people do.
But you can do it.
Our constitution, is strewn around, um, through various documents, acts of Parliament, and through history.
One of the earliest written contributions is the Magna Carta of twelve fifteen, for example.
But to get more up to date, all the various parliamentary reform acts, of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Starting off as First Reform Bill, eighteen thirty-two, Second Reform Bill, eighteen sixty-seven.
Then, really the same thing, but in the twentieth century called, Representation of the People's Act.
Um, nineteen eighteen, nineteen twenty-nine, nineteen sixty-eight, those acts.
The Parliament Bill of nineteen eleven, which took away, a lot of the powers of the House of Lords.
All these are written, and if you collect them together, they form, a huge, written ensemble, um, which, collectively, are a large part of the British Constitution.
And of course there are many other acts, like the Ballot Act of eighteen eighty-one.
Uh, which also you, you can tip into that category.
So, a lot of the British Constitution is, in fact, written.
It's just strewn around.
Um, but, because it's strewn around, um, that, helps to make the constitution, our constitution very flexible.
And there is indeed, a very important part, of the British Constitution which is not written.
Summed up under the term Conventions, um, Constitutional Practice.
Conventions of Constitutional Practice, what actually happens, um, and these conventions, are flexible, and they support the view, um, usually put forward by, people who like the British Constitution, that, um, the allegedly unwritten nature, has its advantages.
You can change the constitution as necessary, without going through cumbersome procedures.
One example, is, fairly obvious.
Um, in the nineteenth century, the prime minister was more often in the House of Lords than not.
But the last, um, prime minister to be in the Lords, was Lord Salisbury, who retired in nineteen oh two, at the very beginning of what is, for a few weeks, the present century.
As_ a few weeks still.
And since then, no prime minister has been in the Lords.
Two, two, um, candidates were rejected, among other reasons, because they were lords.
Curzon in twenty-three, and Halifax in nineteen forty.
This wasn't the only reason.
In nineteen sixty-three a peer did become prime minister, Douglas Hume, but he had to ren_ um, renounce his peerage, which you could legally do by then.
You couldn't in nineteen twenty-four, and seek a common seat.
Um, it_ with the greater democracy of the twentieth century, it was_ became a convention that prime minister, the cheif's_ the chief, um, elected person, head of the executives, the chief, um, servant of the people had to be in the Commons, which was elected by the people.
But there's still no_ there is still_ it's still in fact no law, no constitutional rule, that the prime minister has to be in the Commons.
The prime minister could still be in the Lords.
Or, the the prime minister c- need not be in either house.
The story of Douglas Hume, in fact, was for several weeks in  sixty-three, prime minister without being either a member of the Lords or Commons.
What about the present reform of the House of Lords, you may ask.
Well, um, that's not relevant to what I'm saying at the moment.
I'm talking about practice up to now.
But I'll come back to the Lords Reform, soon.
Um, however, um, conventions, also have to exist, or do exist, in countries which have written constitutions.
They have to adapt their constitutions, to change in circumstances, just as we do.
The American constitution's a good example.
Um, how do they do it.
Well, you could change the constitution, um, itself, but that's a very cumbersome process.
Because naturally constitution laws, and input are not to be changed lightly, if they're in the constitution itself.
Um, so, how do they adapt.
Well, partly, by getting the Supreme Court to interpret, general, simple, eighteenth-century clauses, of the constitution, rather, s- um, liberally, to being them up to date.
And partly, simply, by using conventions themselves.
Conventions exist in the U-S congress, about how to get about things.
Um, one example of that, is that, um, powerful congressional committees, used to deal with legislation, and determine whether legislative processes went forward, or not.
Um, now, in the nineteen nineties the power us U-S, congressional committees has been much whittled down.
The chairman, of U-S congressional committees, was always the next senior person after the, previous chairman retired.
That was a convention, it wasn't written in the eighteenth century constitution.
But now that's gone entirely.
There's great competition for chairmanship, of, select committees.
But, um, that's only in the nineteen nineties.
So, no, constitution can en_ exclude the use of conventions.
Nevertheless, our constitution is more flexible than the American one.
Because, it's less easy, in many cases, to point to a document and said, it w- say, it was written in seventeen eighty-seven, that we have to do things, this way.
Um, which Americans do.
The American_ in America it's much easier to block things than to change things.
Gun control is a good example.
In seventeen eighty-seven, the constitution said every citizen should the right to bear arMs  which make great sense in Amer_ in colo_ in, not colonial, in the rural, America of seventeen eighty-seven.
The wild America, cabins in the clearings of the woods.
You had to defend yourself against Indians, renegade white men, you had to shoot, wild beasts, and you had to shoot your own dinner.
There wasn't a supermarket, you went out and shot a deer.
They had to shoot rattlesnakes.
It makes no sense now that everyone carry guns, really, in the urban America of nineteen ninety-nine.
Nevertheless, you can't really change the constitution.
While all we need to do is have a quick law, on gun control.
If we have it, and we have had recently.
Um, however, um, the difference, with other advanced countries, the U-K's uniqueness in constitutional matters have been much whittled down.
Recently, with the_ Mr  Blair's Labour government.
We've had, um, constitutional laws on devolution.
Which of course is all written.
Devolution to Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
We're going to have a bill of rights.
And then Euro law is increasingly overtaking whatever we might want to decided to do in Britain, anyway.
And that's definitely written down.
And it takes precedence over, whatever legislation is passed in Westminster.
So I think, it's another of the many unique features of Britain, which is, sadly, going to go out of the window, over the next fifty years."
"It's often argued, that at least in the parliamentary context, Britain is a classic, two-party system, and has been so, for a very long time.
Um, from, about eighteen sixty to nineteen twenties, the two parties, were Conservative and Liberal, from the nineteen twenties to today, um, Conservative, and Labour.
The Conservatives have great staying power, even though, they've taken some very hard knocks, over the last two years.
Um, but this idea of, a rough and ready, game of cricket.
There are two teams, one team in, one team out.
Is both an exaggeration, and a simplification.
In fact, in the present House of Commons, there're around ten parties represented.
Um, uh, some of them are rather small, like the various Northern Irish parties, or even, say, the Welsh Nationalists only have four M-Ps.
But, nevertheless, um, they all have, um, party allegiance.
There's only one M-P, who's an independent.
No party allegiance, that's Martin Bell.
And he was elected in, highly specific circumstances.
Says he's not really a politician, and will only sta- only serve one term.
Um, what two-party really means, is that only two parties at any one time_ as I say, Liberals and Conservatives to the nineteen twenties, Labour and Conservatives from then to now, have any realistic chance, of forming a government.
Um, there have always been, um, third or fourth parties around of some significance.
Not to go on about the Tiddlers.
Um, for example, um, from eighteen eighty-six there were the Liberal Unionists, a breakaway from the main Liberal Party, because they didn't want home rule for Ireland.
They merged with the Tories, in the eighteen nineties.
But then, from nineteen hundred there was the rising Labour Party, still a minority.
From nineteen twenty-two, when the, Labour had got there, replaced the Liberals.
They were the declining, Liberals, until the nineteen forties.
Probably, um, the two-party system was its purist, from nineteen forty-five to nineteen seventy.
Where, overwhelmingly, both in terms in votes and seats, about ninety-five percent of seats, and ninety-five percent of votes, went to either Conservative or Labour.
And the Liberals, at one time, in nineteen fifty-five, had only half a million votes, and only half seats_ ha- and only five seats.
But from, nineteen sixties the Liberals start reviving.
And, by now, you have a very substantial Liberal Democratic representation.
As a third party, forty-six, M-Ps, and you have, um, all sorts of minor, mainly nationalist parties, Celtic in, um, in provenance.
But, um, the idea that only two parties, can have a chance of forming the government, is not in fact particularly unusual, unique, um, to Britain.
It's true in Germany.
Um, it's true in a way in France, where you have, two-party groupings.
The Socialists on the alleged left and, the Gaullists and Allies on the fro_ on the right, um, for example.
Now, another tack, another line, is, to ask is our party system, natural or artificial.
It's_ used to be defined by political scientists, and sociologists around nineteen seventy.
That a natural, party structure was one based, crudely speaking, on class and income.
Social cleavages.
While an artificial party system was more ca_ capricious.
People voting as, some Marxist political scientists thought, um, frivolously, or, um, in a diversionary way.
For instance, um, people voted for the Liberal Democrats, simply because_ or the Liberals simply because, they were disillusioned with one of the main parties, and they'd go back to one of the main parties.
Um, well, in a way, the natural cleavage, suited British politics into the seventies.
Labour had, overwhelmingly an industrial working-class core of support.
The Tories, a middle-class core of support.
Although, the picture wasn't perfect, other people voted for both parties, besides the cores.
In fact, the Conservatives would never have got into power, if all the working class had voted, um, Labour, between the nineteen twenties and nineteen seventies.
In fact, crudely speaking around a third, of, what might be called the working class voted Tory in that period.
And two thirds Labour.
Um, our political parties have been formed historically in different ways.
The Conservatives descend, from pre-industrial Tory groupings.
From elite groups of the, eighteenth century.
When there was constitutional government, but nothing like a democracy.
And where, as voting expanded, they were a top-down party.
They were created in Parliament, and then had to form, sort of, branches in the country, in the constituencies.
Labour is a bottom-up party.
It was an offshoot of trade union organisation, in the early twentieth century, and um, it was really a sort of parliamentary branch of the trade union started life.
The Liberals started like the Tories, out of Whig and radical factions, of the early  nineteenth century, and then they spread outwards.
Um, for a while they were the, most successful of the two main parties, until the split of eighteen sixty-six.
Taking in, the upper working class who'd got the vote, and most of the urban middle class.
And, they tended to identify better with Victorian causes, like, free trade, um, the nonconformist conscious, often linked with pacifism, and anti-drink drives.
Temperance.
Uh, as the Victorian obsessions lost there hold over the electorate, so the Liberals did worse.
There was also a split over Ireland.
Um, then, when the Liberals declined, they had to invent themselves_ reinvent themselves as a bottom-up party with great difficulty.
So, you have the Liberal community politics of the sixties, and seventies.
Often, and currently called community politics.
Between nineteen fifty, and nineteen seventy, was the era of the alleged Great Consensus.
It was argued that the two main parties behaved very similar once in office.
Labour was allegedly for nationalisation.
But, when in office was obviously not going to nationalise the whole economy like the, uh, communists might do.
The Tories were for free enterprise, but accepted the nationalisations of coal, railways, and a few other things, which Attlee's Labour Government had done forty-five, fifty-one.
Um, the la_ that Labour government, the Minister Aneurin Bevan had set up the National Health Service.
But, when the Tories came in they accepted it.
They said they'd have set one up anyway if they'd been in.
And, um, they didn't destroy the National Health Service.
In fact they spent more money on it in the fifties.
Partly because there was more money.
So they could spend more money than Labour had done.
Um, but this idea, uh, of consensus, became, to be under attack, from political scientists from the nineteen seventies.
It was felt that, um, the Labour Party as a whole was A, divided, between parliamentary and non-parliamentary wings.
But th_ the trade unions outside Parliament, were running away with the party and reorientated towards the left.
In the mean time, the Thatcherites, to a degree, under the formidable leader, Mrs Thatcher, leader of the Tories from seventy-five, captured, the, Conservative Party, and pushed it from, paternalism, into a revived sort of free market economics.
Um, now we might have a new consensus, um, ironically based around Thatcherism and water.
That Mr Blair's Labour Party have accepted a lot of Mrs Thatcher's reforms and changes of the thirties.
Uh, i, heard talk by Mr Flair_ Blair, Freudian slip, by Mr Blair yesterday evening, where, he praised Mrs Thatcher for reducing the excess power of the trade unions.
To hear a Labour prime minister, or a Labour leader, say that in public, in the nineteen sixties and nineteen seventies, it's a good thing, that excess power of the trade unions have been reduced, they might have thought it.
But to hear them say it in public, you'd think you're either drunk, or dreaming, or subject to hallucinations.
Uh, so that shows.
So there's a new consensus, nowadays, perhaps, but a rather different one.
Uh, the, the extreme, uh, the, polarisation, the drawing apart of the parties was at its highest in the nineteen eighties.
A more socialist Labour Party, a more free market Tory one.
What about the role of the annual party conferences.
Historically, the Labour conference had a far greater policy-making power.
But, Tony Blair has tamed it.
It's now closer to the equivalence_ um, while the Tory Party conference was regarded as sort of national rally, where the Tory elite politicians just, cheered up the troops.
Nevertheless, the Tory Party conference could assert itself on policy, um, at times.
Now I think the two conferences in practice, are converging.
Financial support, there's convergence there.
The Tories, uh, traditionally had the support of business, big and small.
Um, the, um, Labour, financial support from the trade unions.
While both parties tried to get individual contributions from their members.
Well you had to contribute, if you're a member of either party.
About five pounds a year or something.
But now, Blair has wooed business, with some success.
Which is traditionally the Torys' domain.
So there's, convergence there.
Um, overall the assumptions about the parties, their composition and financing, their policies.
The old assumptions of the nineteen forties to seventies, um, are, increasingly outdate_ outdated.
Particularly the idea that, party support was based on class.
Um, and this is largely because, our class structure is changing.
I believe we're changing from a, class-based society, where society is like a ladder, from upper class to destitute.
To a middle-mass society, where society is shaped like a rugby ball or an egg.
You have the top ten percent, who are far richer than average, and the top_ bottom, and the bottom ten percent, who're relatively destitute, and the other eighty percent of the middle_ the middle mass, are much more fluid.
Obviously, not everyone's identic- it.
But the difference in wealth is a factor of one to five, rather than one to twenty.
And indeed in lifestyle.
Um, but the idea_ the Marxist idea that party support was based on class, um, can be challenged.
It might only be a sort of, parochial cultural concept of the mid twentieth century.
In Victorian and Edwardian times, other factors had been important.
Regional factors, religious factors, in Lancashire and Glasgow, whether you're Catholic or Protestant.
Which has always been the case in Northern Ireland, and general economic factors.
I.
E.
Not the economic interest of a class.
But of a whole, industry or agriculture.
The agricultural, uh, counties, voted Tory or Whig in the nineteenth century for example.
Um, and today class has eroded.
Regional politics, you've only_ don't just look at Northern Ireland, look at Scotland and Wales, have made a thumping big clum- comeback.
And it's more difficult to base, parties on class.
Because, as I said, class lines are far less rigid, than they were.    "
"One has found, uh, in the United States a common confusion on the part of American citizens, between Communism.
. .  Or shall we say Marxism in its purest form.
And the government of the Soviet Union, um, following August 1914 and October 1917.
One must immediately realize, that many Americans have been given, uh, the propaganda shall we say it.
Um, that the government of the Soviet Union and to some extent Maoist China are, essentially, pure Communist nations, they were Marxist nations.
In the same way that the United States of America espouses Smithian Capitalism.
So did the governments of Lenin, and Stalin, and Mao espouse Marxism.
In both cases there were attempts at indoctrinating the people, or inspiring the people through populous rhetoric.
The communist system, to large extent never existed, how is that possible.
In a communist system one cannot possibly give the communist party, shall we say the centralized politburo within the Kremlin the ability to distribute private property.
Private property would be in the hands of the workers councils.
Ironically, as many people may sit in disbelief, the Soviet Union was a large misnomer.
The Soviets never existed, and this was one of the cries of Trotsky himself.
The Soviets, or workers' councils, never came to power.
Instead organizations referred to as Soviets which acted as recruitment stations, for the central politburo and for the communist party themselves, were the ones that were established.
They were not workers' councils, the workers had no say as to the allocation of private property, natural resources, within the industrial institutions that were established by Stalin, during the new economic program.
Lenin realized this, Trotsky told the world, and hence was assassinated.
The Leninist system essentially became as much of a bureauc_ bureaucratic, or shall we say bourgeois autocracy, as the any of the b- bourgeois autocracies that Lenin himself opposed.
It became a dictatorship of councils.
And became a dictatorship of the communist party.
When it was the party’s responsibility to allocate private property, never in the hands of labor.
This fact has been obfuscate, has been, been muddled in the waters of propaganda in the Capitalist West, which is of course, not truly Smithian Capitalist as a lot of us already know, and I will talk about later, hopefully.
The... Communist system, were it to be fully realized, may not necessarily have given the Soviet Union the ability to survive the Cold War.
Though in an Estate Capitalist System, and shall we say the Stalin Estate Capitalist System was highly inefficient.
It was highly inefficient in its ability to deliver goods, and distribute them throughout the Soviet Union.
Even efforts, even public works efforts such as the Trans-Siberian Railway, and other large scale public works programs, though in an attempt to establish the infrastructure needed for an autarkical economic system, were in and of themselves failures.
If it is impossible to establish the foundations and infrastructure needed for an industry to begin with.
And for an autarkical industry at that.
Because we know that, we have found that the Politburo – the Communist Party was not interested in the convertibility of the ruble.
<>  The ability to first isolate a system, and then not provide, um, the ability, um, to distribute goods, is immediate economic suicide.
What’s more, the Soviet Union was inherently not able, um, to produce goods at a_ despite its, its attempt at central planning, still had the same faults as unregulated capitalism.
They tended to over produce and e- essentially have make work_ jobs the same problem that existed in Maoist China during the great leap forward.
The ability to, to over- overshoot demand, greatly.
And then the attempt to subsidize_ and there subsidize the excess supply through drop in prices.
These obviously eliminated the Soviet Union’s ability to ever have an economy that grew, other than through forcible state planning.
The political aspects of subjugation, and, and open, oppression of both, um, dissidents within the Soviet Union and within its satellite and client states, made it inherently unpopular.
And Leninists began immediately to divorce, the politics of, the “Communist System"", from its economic failings.
Let’s immediately begin to realize that communism and socialism were used as banners to appease.
Or shall we say use as propaganda, um, to appease the peoples of, of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Eastern Germany, etcetera, etcetera, they were not truths.
No more so than the, the freedom and, shall we say, freedom and capitalism arguments of the West, uh, are, are no more tr- lie in truth.
Um, we should hope that, with closer reading of the works of Marx.
With, with closer readings of Engels, and closer readings of Gramsci, and (Marcus) and true understanding of Marxism.
One can realize that the failings of the_ Soviet State Capitalism, shall we say, Stalinist State Capitalism are not the failings of the philosophy of Marx.
Neither are the failings of Maoist China, necessarily, the failings of Marx.
One must immediately divorce his ideas of, of what we have been given as propaganda from the truth.
If one reads Marx, one should be able to form his or her own educated opinion, um, about this great philosopher.
And then one must be able to divorce those ideas from the rhetoric and the history of failed Maoist and Stalinist State Cap_"
"I'd like to talk about desertification, in Africa.
With particular focus on, West Africa, and the Sahelian region.
And the critical issues in desertification, that I would like to discuss, are what it is, and how it is seen.
Now, desertification, simplistically means, land becoming more desert-like.
That is, devoid of vegete- vegetation.
And effectively useless, for man's production.
Now, how th- the classic image of a desert, is, an infertile region.
But where does it end, and where does it begin, is the critical question here.
Is it that_ the idea of desertification, was born in the nineteen fifties.
But ideas, originated, in the early part of the century.
In the French West African colonies.
Where there is a lot of_ there are periods of famine, and, drought.
Which had led the French to believe, that, there was a gradual drying-up process occurring.
Now these thoughts were mirrored in other parts of the world.
And, researchers were looking at fact, that in geological time there are very dry periods.
And they thought that as a desert_ the desert was advancing.
As the land was drying up_ and they, presented various inf_ uh, evidence for this case.
Wells drying out, trees dying.
And it, it, generated quite a lot of concern.
And there's a British professor, called Professor Stebbing, who visited, Northern Nigeria, in nineteen thirty-six, and travelled around, the region, noting various things.
And he was very unfamiliar with, with the region.
He had just come from India.
He wasn't f_ um, fam_ it was in the dry season.
And if you go to the region in the dry season, it does, look like a desert.
There's sand everywhere, the trees are leafless.
Well most of them are.
And it does look like a very in_ inhostile [inhospitable] region.
And as Stebbing vi_ wandered around and, uh, reached the conclusion, that_ because of man's, uh, the local people's, relentless, uh exploitation of the land for agriculture.
And what he considered as their, uh, disturbance of the balance of nature.
That they were bringing upon themselves the, the advancing desert.
The idea of an advancing dethe_ desert, definitely has strong Biblical connotations.
This silent vast force of nature which ov_ overtakes man, and prevents him from living.
Anyway, it generated  concern amongst the colonial offices.
And, both the French and the British got together, in nineteen thirty-seven and, formed, a joint_ a joint, uh, team to explore the possibility, and do research.
Now as it happens in nineteen thirty-seven, the rains were pat_ particularly good.
So the team, uh, went around, um, the border region of Niger in Nigeria, looking into it.
And with the good rains, they, they reached conclusions completely, uh, to the contrary of Stebbing.
And, there's one man in the team who said, 'well, you know, opening up land and changing it, has been part of man's progress in Europe in the past.
And, there's nothing particularly wrong with that.
And it does, very much depend on the, the rainfall conditions.
'Anyway, there are still some who believe that the desert was advancing.
But, through, through the war years, and the fifties, and sixties it, didn't really generate much interest at all.
Because the rains were good in the region.
Then in the not_ uh, late sixties, early seventies, the alarm bells started ringing again.
Um, and th- the myth was returned to the idea of an advancing desert, a famine, large, protracted famine.
While drought_ I should say drought, um, occurred in the region.
And, the blame was put, again, on the, the drying out_ this was the_ this was the end.
The desert was gonna roll over the place.
Um, so they once more, brought back the idea of desertification.
And this time they really, pointed the finger at the lo_ at the local people.
It was their fault.
More, they had_ there's the idea_ as happened_ at the same the idea that the, the fuel crisis_ the wood fu_ the wood fuel crisis was born.
The idea that, people were chopping down their trees around the villages.
That it was no longer able to protect the, the harmful forces of the wind, they were destroying the vegetation.
These simplistic ideas were born, that the population was too much.
And, that the desert was advancing.
But, research into it properly, showed, that this is not the case at all.
But, you had to consider that a crisis narrative was very important, for raising, money for_ to help in situations like that.
And, in nineteen eighty-four, George Bush, said, that, the Sahara was advancing at nine kilometers a year.
Where he got that from I don't know.
No one knows.
But, that idea, is very powerful in the European imagination.
That, the desert, um, is just advancing.
So to stop it there was loads of interven_ a lot of int_ interventions.
Idea of windbreaks, um, planting of trees.
I mean often, in ways, and with trees that were totally alien to the peoples, there.
Now, this idea of a desert advancing.
That, that where the desert begins, and where it starts, there's no fixed line at all.
The rains, vary, when they come, and where they land, each year.
So, there is a, there is a vague transition_ those are transitions, and the_ is, is more correct.
So, you can't actually put a line, and say, 'well, it's nine kilometres further south this year,' at all.
It perhaps happens in patches.
But, the idea is still very strong.
And in nineteen seventy-seven there was an international U-N conference on desertification.
And, the evidence was still, still there.
I mean it's good business for scientists to have a, a popular idea.
I mean a popular idea, and, environmental management, in_ in the world at this time, is Global Warming.
That's great for business wh_ if you're a scientist.
There's a lot of, uh, to research out there.
Well this was the case with desertification.
And a lot of experts, went out, to the region, and, made their opinions.
Well, here we go back to the original problem.
They're outsiders, looking at the problem.
Which, they don't know at all.
Just like Stebbing in the first place.
He, was in the dry_ he was there in the dry season.
He'd never been there before.
But yet, he reached his conclusion.
And this is_ this is the problem.
But still the term of 'watching desertification' has stuck in the, in the scientific discourse.
And even as recent as nineteen ninety-four, there was a further con_ uh, convention.
U-N convention to combat desertification.
And I think_ I'm not saying that desertification... In terms of, meaning land degradation, does not exist.
There are, certainly, parts of, of the region, the dry regions where, soil productivity has fallen.
But there is no de_ there is no vast desert advancing.
And long time studies have shown that, even in regions where there are unstable sand dunes.
That, they're not actually engulfing villages.
And, I think what I'd like to end on is, is the idea that, to understand, the environment relationships with, humans in the region.
You have to, actually speak to the people there, and find out_ and speak to them about their histories, and the region, to understand it further."
"English overseas explorers and traders, fifteen hundred, um, sixteen hundred.
Sorry, I meant, English overseas explorers and traders, fifteen fifty, sixteen hundred.
Now, in the year, fifteen hundred, English traders and sailors were very parochial.
Largely hugging the channel in North Sea coasts.
Um, going all the way from London, to the low countries.
Really adventurous.
Um, by sixteen hundred, English sea dogs and explorers were famous.
All sorts of romantic legends accrete.
See the sea dogs of Elizabethan England, good Queen Bess as their, lady patron.
The Spanish Main.
Robbing Spanish galleons, fighting wicked Spanish Papists, etcetera, etcetera.
Um, all this was written up by Victorian historians, this image.
Uh, in a boy's own adventure way.
Indeed, to inspire boys of Victorian England, to do likewise, for the, enlarging British Empire, of the nineteenth century.
The Victorians felt a sort of kinship, with the Elizabethan sea dogs.
Felt they were the pioneers.
Um, this romantic picture of course, we wouldn't quite accept these days.
Um, but in fact, you can at least accept that the, explorations were adventurous and brave.
They were prompted however, by something much more, prosaic.
The so_ the slow collapse of the Antwerp Market for English wool and cloth, fifteen fifty-one, fifteen eighty-one.
The English could no longer complacently just sail their cloth to Antwerp, and unload their wool and cloth, uh, easily as they had been doing up till then.
So they had to look, further afield.
Um, England, was overwhelmingly dependent in foreign trade in Antwerp, you see.
Um, this was mainly dealt with, in fact, by something not particularly romantic.
Transferring, um, the European cloth trade to German, and later to North Dutch Ports.
Especially to Amsterdam.
But here I want to concentrate, on the search it also prompted, for further flung, far more exotic markets.
Um, first of all, the halfway houses.
Um, it, led to an East Mediterranean trade with the Turkish Empire.
Also interesting because, it gave a boost to joint stock companies.
Sort of much more modern form of commercial organisation.
The Levant Company was founded in fifteen eighty-one, it became very prosperous, importing currants.
That's dried grapes, etcetera.
Which the English elite really loved.
Um, broadly similar part of the world.
The Muslim Southwest Mediterranean, Morocco and Algeria.
Trade with them revived from fifteen fifty-one.
There had been some in the Middle Ages.
Um, sugar, was got from North Africa.
But it was, f- li- much smaller than the trade with um, the Eastern Turkish Empire.
Um, the largely ineffective Barbary Company was set up, to, regulate it.
Overall a small trade.
Perhaps more interesting, was the search for a north east passage.
A north east passage to China.
They didn't realise how far away China actually was.
This involved going up the Baltic.
And of course, you didn't get to China.
But it did lead to trade with Russia.
And, a c- a Russia Company was founded in fifteen fifty-five.
We can call this the first adventurous attempt.
The first attempt of the English to go, where, English people just hadn't gone before.
They had gone to the Mediterranean before.
Willoughby and Chancellor, advised by the ancient Italian Sebastian Cabot, in fifteen fifty-three, um, mounted the first expedition over there.
They made their way to Moscow, the Moscow of Ivan the Terrible, and they managed to survive.
Which was a feat in itself.
And eventually the Muscovy Company was formed.
This was_ in the fifteen fifties was the first jock_ joint stock company.
The first of these modern sorts of organisation.
But its role was still limited in short-term.
Um, trade with Russia, was modest and prosaic, but useful.
Tallow wax, cordage flax and hides, were bought from them.
Now we come to the transoceanic voyages and explorations.
Um, these are impressive and romantic.
These are impressive and romantic, but also ruthless and bloody.
Um, there's_ there is a thin record, of transatlantic voyages going back to the fourteen nineties.
The Cabots, in fourteen ninety-seven were commissioned to explore, Newfoundland, by Henry VII.
But essentially, um, things do not get going until, the fifteen fifties.
There is some, um, trade with, West Africa, based in Plymouth by, William Hawkins in the fifteen thirties.
Um, he buys peppers there and brings them back.
Peppers were very important in those days, because, it was hard to keep meat fresh.
And, he also, um, went to Port- Portuguese Brazil, to buy dye wood.
But, this was small.
The first, um, slave trader.
Which became a very prosperous English trade, was James Locke, in fifteen fifty-five.
He brought, um, black slaves back to England.
But the real advances were under Elizabeth, from the fifteen sixties onwards.
If you can call the slave trade an advance.
Um, William's sons, the famous Hawkin brothers, established the triangle of se_ trade.
Or, sketched out rather than established, is better.
Um, breaking into the Spanish monopoly of South America.
The English went to West Africa, traded, um, rather more modern goods with the indigenous chiefs.
Got slaves in return.
Sold them, to the Spanish colonists in the New World, which was against the Spanish monopoly.
And brought, spices and sugar back.
Um, there was also an attempt to find the, north west Passage, to China.
Through the Arctic, which naturally didn't work.
But, it got people to know North America.
Got the English to know North America better.
This culminates, in the most famous of all these attempts.
Jakes_ Francis Drake's circumnavigation of the globe, in fifteen seventy-seven, eighty.
He, um, goes to South America, he goes, to the Philippines, and, to what's now Indonesia, challenging, the Spanish and Portuguese for colonies there.
He establishes trade with the Sultan of Moluccas, in what's now Indonesia, buying peppers and bringing them back, from which he makes a huge profit.
He also on the way, in a diver_ just as a little diversion, goes to what is now California.
So, this is the first great challenge to the Portuguese in Asia.
And, it is also obviously a challenge to the Spanish in South America.
In sixteen hundred, the East India Company is founded.
Which has a greater spectacular future for the English.
However, we must remember that English were latecomers.
The Arabs, the Portuguese, and the Spanish had all been there in tros_ transoceanic popula_ uh, exploration, before them.
And these were pioneering attempts.
But they're important, and confidence-building.
It all overlaps with the sea war piracy against the Spaniards.
Um, but, Elizabethan exploration itself was more, geographical than quantitative.
The great commercial exploitations of these English pioneers, belong to the, seventeenth century when they make huge attempts, to challenge the Spanish and Portuguese.
And also have to deal with a new, northern, and Protestant contender, the Dutch."
"The world of the English peasants, fifteenth century, sixteenth century.
England in those days, was between eighty-five, ninety percent, rural in peasant population.
It is now about the same percentage, suburban, or urban.
And even though farmers, and farm workers survive today.
It is just as one occupation among others.
Rather than as a latter-day peasant society.
Which some of our neighbours, such as France still have.
Or Italy.
Indeed most people who live in the countryside today are commuters, they do not have rural jobs.
They go into the nearest town to work, or they're retired people.
So, few things illustrate the otherness, of the world of fifteen hundred.
I think this otherness of historical periods, is profoundly educative.
And the need to think in terms, not of the man in the street, but of the man in the field, the wood, or the heath.
And the women and children there too.
Peasant children, didn't go to school much, if at all, and from the age of five or six they were looking after the geese, or the sheep or something.
I will approach, this group systematically.
Let's have a look at the institutional arrangements.
The most important was the manor.
A manor is not just a manor house, as we think today.
It is a unit of land held by a lord, who could be an earl, a knight, a rich townsman, or, an abbot or a bishop.
Roughly divided into two parts.
There was the lord's own domain.
Which was like a sort of gentleman farm, which he might run himself, or lease out to a wealthy farmer.
And then there were the tenements.
The peasant small holdings.
These were held on an extraordinary variety, of, arrangements and leases.
Copy hold, for example, meant that the tenant_ the peasant tenant had a copy of his tenancy agreement.
Customary tenants, could be anything depending on the custom of the manor, how they would he- hold.
Um, villeins, were a curious mixture in category of, slave and free.
They held their small holding and in turn they had to do, services in the lord's domain, at- ploughed and harvest, for example.
And they could not leave the manor, officially.
So they were not free in that way.
At the top of society there were the freeholders.
Who held, their land, in much the same way as we might have a farm, a house, a factory today.
They owned it almost outright.
But not quite.
They still had to acquit a trivial rent.
The main thing to get hold of, is in spite of the extraordinary variety of tenurial arrangements.
Um, tenures, or most of them, [cough] were hereditary, even though ownership was divided.
I.
E.
If you were a copyholder, you didn't just hold your small farm for a couple of years.
Um, you, had the right to pass it on, to your son, or to your nearest heir, as long as you fulfilled your obligations, to, the lord of the manor.
Um, nowadays we're used to a much simpler arrangement.
You either own your house or land, or you rent it, for a fixed, lease.
In those days it was much more complicated.
Ownership tended to be divided.
This brings us to farming practice and standard of living.
Well, farming practice, had an extraordinary variety over Britain.
Um, farming today is still determined, to some degree, by the local geography, climate, soil, relief.
But in those days it was absolutely determined, by it.
Because, powerful technology couldn't offset natural factors.
You could roughly divide Britain to the pastoral West.
Wales, Yorkshire, Lancashire, upland Yorkshire, anyway, the West Country, Welsh Borders.
Where the emphasis was more on livestock, and on herding.
Rather than on corn.
And to the_ and the arable East.
Not too different from today, in a very broad way.
The arable East, East Anglia.
The Southeast, where the emphasis was on, nucleated villages and the growing of corn.
But of course, there were pockets, of pastoral predominance in the East, and pockets of arable in the West or North.
And everyone had to grow some corn.
Because if you didn't, you might starve.
You couldn't export it_ um, you couldn't import it in from Australia, or America if there was not enough corn.
Uh, America, and Australia hadn't been discovered.
Or hardly.
Ha ha.
So you had to grow your barley on the spot.
Even in upland Wales.
But, what it meant was, that in the pastoral areas you did not grow corn for sale.
You, you would emphasise your flocks.
Um, agriculture was communal, often.
The famous open field, strip system.
Where instead of compact little farm, um, you had, or each family had, alternating strips in about three or four open fields.
Um, and this, led to, conservatism of agricultural practice.
The emphasis in the village communities were in co-operation.
Which meant, according to custom, customary practice.
Um, there was low productivity.
For example, in the Wars of the Roses in the late fifteenth century, the opposing armies often hid in fields of corn, near harvest time.
And we think today, how could they do that.
Because corn stalks are not very high.
If an army hid in a field of corn today, it would just trample the whole things down.
But in those days, cornstalks could be higher than a man.
Six or seven feet.
And, um, you could hide in them.
What it meant of course, was the energy of the plant went into the stalks, and the yield of the grain was very low.
Maybe, two grains for every one planted, or something abysmal.
Which you only find in parts of Africa and Asia today.
Um, you know we've got rid of all, that today.
You had subsistence farming, therefore.
Peasants usually only grew enough, to feed themselves.
Maybe a little over, to, sell.
But not much.
And there was a vicious circle.
Because pasture, um, was low, and of poor quality, they couldn't keep many livestock.
Um, that meant they didn't have the dung to improve, either the grassland or the corn lands.
Which meant that productivity continued to be low, so they couldn't keep, many livestock.
A vicious circle.
What about social divisions.
There are many social divisions among the peasantry.
There was the yeoman.
The most successful, often a freeholder but not necessarily, who was a remote ancestor of the modern farmer.
Might have fifty acres or more, and produce more for the market.
Rather than for subsistence economy.
Down to the cottager, who might only have, rights to one acre, plus some rights to graze on the heath or common land.
All over England there are places called Wandsworth Common, or whatever, Clapham Common.
And they were once actually, a vital part of, the agricultural economy.
Even though they're now in the middle of London.
They were grazing for the community.
A community's livestock.
They were also_ tended to be self-sufficient in crafts and tools.
They'd make those in the village.
A remnant of this, until almost within_ till within living memory, was the village blacksmith, or wheelwright.
Uh, who've now gone out as far making agricultural machinery is concerned.
They could take up non-farming secondary occupations.
Um, felling timber, fishing.
Um, helping the lords to hunt or fight.
But all this limited, and subsistence life, led to an intense localism.
Peasants spent most of their life around the village, unless they, enlisted in the army, or were forced to enlist in the army, or starvation, caused them to wander.
Um, they might go to the local market town occasionally.
But even that, not very often.
You can't um, quantify how often they went to the local market town because, the records aren't there.
But obviously peasants were there on market day.
But they rarely went further afield in, normal times.
Indeed going further afield was probably the sign of despair, disruption, war or famine, rather than the sign of prosperity, as we would think it today.
Um, most peasants were illiterate.
Preserving often, customs and dialects which went back to Anglo Saxon times.
They were not however, totally outside of the monetary economy.
They would sell, um, a little grain, in a good year.
But most of all, they sold, hides and wool from their sheep.
This was the great, time of the wool and cloth trade, in the English economy.
And everyone, from the king, down to the humblest peasant had sheep.
Although the humblest peasant had far fewer than the king or an earl.
But they'd sell the wool, and they'd sell the hides.
And, um, they needed money say, to pay taxes.
And they probably did a few c- of their own commercial transactions.
Economic conditions for the peasantry were relatively favourable for the fourteen eighties, fifteen twenties.
It was a time of depopulation.
There were not enough people to work the land.
So they had an advantage.
They were_ there was a shortage of labour, they had an advantage vis-a-vis the lords.
Then with the population rise from fifteen thirty turned to the worse.
And you had all sorts of problems facing the peasantry in the, sixteenth century, which I'll just enumerate.
There was land hunger.
Which, gave the advantage to the upper class landlords.
Compounded by enclosure.
Often for sheep farming.
So the open fields, got um, enclosed, or heath land_ whereas heath land and woodland, free grazing got enclosed.
And, um, peasants could lose their rights for chicanery in a law case.
Um, holdings, the lord if he had a chance, through the legal, processes would amalgamate two, peasant holdings, when, the holder or one of them died.
Which could mean that one family was forced off the land and had to beg or work as labourers.
Um, and sheep farming itself was less labour intensive.
Um, ploughing with oxen, you've probably seen the picturesque medieval prints, was very labour intensive.
Old drawings, prints or drawings.
But, sheep farming wasn't, it was a shepherd, his boy and a dog, could look after lots of sheep in normal times.
So, there's population rise and unemployment.
Um, Shakespeare himself refers to this sort of thing in his plays, by the fifteen nineties.
What about, um, uh, peasant relaxation.
Well there wasn't too much.
But they had customary feasts related to the Catholic Church for a long time, of course.
Um, these feasts were not necessarily decorous, they could be drunken orgies.
Which is common, in a society, where, you're not sure whether you have enough food all the time.
So when there is plenty of food and drink you over indulge.
Um, the best, representations of this, are seen in Bruegel's, um paintings of peasant feasts.
Which are not English, but, are taking place in the low countries.
But, the society, wouldn't have been very different.
And, um, there was folklore and customs, which have disappeared, ironically, because of the spread of universal elementary education.
But, all sorts of legends, and stories would be told, um, to the_ by members of the family to each other, in the evenings, round the smoky fire."
"The Papists in England and Wales, fifteen sixty, sixteen forty.
The word Papist, by the way, is a rather insulting contemporary term, for Roman Catholic.
Um, they have, an interest to us, in the present day, partly because they're a minority.
Minorities of all sorts, tend to be a contemporary interest.
Although nowadays, they tend in Europe to be racial, rather than religious.
But, the treatment of religious minorities is I think still important in Asia.
Anyway, so let's get back to, our period, and see how this minority was treated.
Now in fifteen sixty, some sort of Catholicism, was normal, among English and Welsh people.
Um, Protestantism had been officially re-established.
And there was, a fairly strong, minority interest in it.
But, it wasn't yet, predominant.
However, it was on the offensive.
Um, Catholic belief, if normal, was both stagnant and conservative.
The religious enthusiasts, the people who're making all the running, were the Protestants.
Particularly, those back from Geneva, with_ of Calvinist inspiration.
They'd been in Geneva during the Catholic Queen Mary's time.
Um, who, became, the English Puritans.
Or the founders of the English Puritan Party.
Now the Queen Elizabeth, was personally conservative.
She was probably some sort of Protestant, but very much a pre-Calvinist one.
Personally conservative, and politically comprehensive.
Although the Church of England was essentially Protestant in doctrine, her new Church of England.
She tried to maintain as many Catholic rituals, that is_ and practices, including robes and alters as possible.
Not to offend, what she knew, um, to be, the vaguely Catholic, inclinations of the majority of her subjects.
Now_ I must be careful when I say Catholic.
Catholic does not necessarily mean Roman Catholic, loyal to the sea of Rome and the Pope.
But, generally Catholic in outlook and belief.
Um, which could be reconciled with being a member of the National Church.
After all it had been under Henry VIII, Elizabeth's father, in the fifteen thirties, and forties.
However, um, what interests, us here, is the survival, I think, of Roman Catholicism.
Um, insultingly called Popery, or Papism, in the time.
Um, that survived.
People were not just, sort of, somewhat bovinely, vaguely Catholic.
Um, quite a, a few people, realised quite consciously, and intellectually, that they were, Roman Catholic at heart.
They could see the distinction.
And there were, many Roman Catholic objections to the new Church of England in spite of the queen's best efforts.
It was essentially Protestant in doctrine.
The rituals didn't fool them.
The somewhat Catholic rituals, which are still there today.
And obviously, it had repudiated the Pope, whose importance to Roman Catholicism, had been hammered in by the events both positive and negative, of the intervening thirty years.
The, Roman Catholic, um, episcopae, to Queen Mary's time, had been deposed, but not killed or persecuted.
And was now, until they died off, a shadow true hierarchy, for Roman Catholics.
As opposed to the official Anglican one.
And in the fifteen sixties a normally domestic, and fairly covert Roman Catholicism was practised, in manor houses.
Houses of other substantial people.
We're not sure about the humbler people.
But they sometimes went to services at the local manor house.
And, there were still surviving Catholic priests around, who'd been dispossessed.
But they would die off fairly soon.
Especially as Tudor lives are much shorter than ours.
And they needed to be replaced.
And from the mid fifteen seventies they were, to the government's disgust and astonishment, they were replaced.
You had the Catholic missioners to England, from the seminaries on the continent.
Jesuits and others.
The most famous are the Jesuits Parsons and Campion, in the fifteen eighties.
And, um, Campion, Edmund Campion, was martyred, caught by the authorities and eventually executed, for being a Catholic missionary.
There's a college, a Jesuit college named after him, in Oxford today.
Campion Hall.
And, they didn't, reconvert the whole of England to Catholicism, of course.
But they did preserve, a Catholic hard core, known also as Recusants, from the Latin 'i refuse'.
I refuse to conform to the established church.
Um, at the same time, by fifteen eighty, Roman Catholicism was being seen, as more of a political, threat.
Because, it was, thought of as being backed by the Pope and the King of Spain.
Who were, intermittently fire breathing, menacing England with war.
So, perfectly, ordinary English Roman Catholics, who'd always lived in England, always_ but, always been Catholic, were, almost considered, as agents of the king of Spain, by this accident.
Missionary priests, were certainly considered as potential agents of Spain.
Even if they weren't, and ran the risk of getting tried and executed, rather nastily.
So a vicious circle was created.
Because English Catholics and their priests were, persecuted in the fifteen eighties, they're often driven into treasonable activity, which, seemed to justify, the government agents who persecuted them in the first place.
Well now we come to King James I, the first Stuart King.
Who succeeded Elizabeth in sixteen oh three, his cousin.
The situation became less fraught, for Roman Catholics.
Um, but there was still the Gun Powder Plot of sixteen oh five.
Where a few Catholics tried to blow up both king and Parliament.
But in fact, this was a sign of Catholic desperation and powerlessness.
Not of Catholic strength.
Overall, however, there was a relatively stable religious situation, compared with the fifteen sixties.
Um, largely, because Catholicism had definitely lost.
By sixteen oh three, England, was overwhelmingly Protestant.
And the really religious fights were within the, Protestant Church, between Puritans, and less extreme Protestants.
The Roman Catholics, although feared as bogeymen, were really on the side.
And James, me_ humanely neglected to enforce the laws against them, most of the time.
He even offered them toleration at one point, officially.
But this didn't work.
They were a decided minority, were Roman Catholics.
Concentrated in remote areas, like Yorkshire and Lancashire, and on the Welsh borders.
Um, but, their_ their perception as a threat, did not totally vanish.
Under James, and especially under Charles, his son, who succeeded him in sixteen twenty-five.
There was an alarming revival of Roman Catholicism.
Not among the people in general.
But among the upper elite, and at court.
Many of the Peers converted to Roman Catholicism.
Even worse, James's Queen Ann, a Danish princess, converted to Catholicism.
Um, Charles went one better, he married a Catholic princess.
Henrietta Maria of France, an alliance, and her religion, was tolerated at court, she was allowed her priests in the chapel.
Which shocked the now, overwhelmingly Puritan gentry class, and merchant class in general.
Same, I think, of humbler people.
Charles himself, um, inclined to the Arminian version of Anglicanism.
Which could be crudely summed up as Catholicism without the Pope.
And his chief bishop, whom he made Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop Lord, um, was the, great exponent of this.
And lots of people, suspected Lord, of simply being a Roman Catholic but not saying so.
Uh, some people even suspected the king of this.
Um, and that aroused suspicions.
In fact, neither Charles, nor Lord, were themselves Roman Catholics, but it looked like it visually.
Um, Charles also, patronised art from Catholic countries.
Buying statues from Italy, patronising the Catholic painter Van Dyck, who as I speak, in late ninety-nine, there's an exhibition of his paintings in London, Charles's Court.
So, at best Charles and Lord were looked upon as Catholic fellow travellers.
External threats conditioned Protestant attitudes.
After sixteen eighteen, the Thirty Years' War got going in Europe.
This meant that Spanish power was reviving.
It seemed that the Spanish Hapsbergs were taking the offensive against the, Protestants of Germany, with whom the_ and against the Dutch, with whom English Protestants had fellow feeling.
This culminates in the Edict of Restitution in sixteen twenty-nine.
Where the emperor, the cousin of the king of Spain, promulgates an edict saying that all monastic lands in Germany should be restored to the Catholic Church.
This is not, in fact, carried out.
But it alarmed the English elite a great deal, because, they felt that Charles, their own king might follow suit, and take away their monastic lands.
Which they'd enjoyed for a hundred years or more.
Which formed the basis of their wealth in many cases.
One the eve of the Civil War itself.
You had the Irish Rebellion.
Now, Ireland was a Catholic country, within the king's domains.
Its_ it wasn't an ex_ an external threat, like Spain.
But it wasn't really an internal threat like English Roman Catholics, who weren't really a threat anyway.
Ireland was in the king's domains, but overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.
The Irish were much mistrusted.
The ratio of the population of Ireland to England, was much higher than today, three to five.
Now it's about one to twenty.
The Irish were alien, not only in religion, but in language.
They overwhelmingly still spoke Gaelic, their own tongue, and in culture.
So when they rose up, and started massacring the English settlers in Ireland, this made, the English parliamentarians very nervous, and assembled the Long Parliament.
Um, made them distrust the king.
They_ some even thought the king might be behind it.
And brought civil war nearer.
Throughout this period, something gets hammered in, which is still around, in a way today.
Protestantism, becomes identified as a core element, of mainland Britishness, as opposed to being Irish.
Unless you happen to be a member of the recusant minority.
And, you_ this, is illustrated by the Protestant heroes, Drake et al, beating the wicked Catholic Spanish of the Armada, and so on.
Um, conversely, Catholicism, comes to be thought of, as somehow, an enemy, of being British.
And the recusant minority, who, cease to be persecuted really, after about sixteen eighty, are_ nevertheless tend to be mistrusted.
Some of this attitude lingers today.
Um, the average Britisher, I think, tends to think of Catholicism as having a Mediterranean, or an Irish stamp.
Uh, and even though most people are sort of atheist, or agnostic.
They tend to be Protestant atheist and agnostic, rather than Catholic atheists and agnostics.
And also it's entered our, culture in a secularised sense.
I mean, Mrs Thatcher, and her liberal individualism.
Would have_ she is, by religion a Methodist, anyway.
Very Protestant.
But, it's very hard to conceive Mrs Thatcher from a Catholic country.
You can get Catholic socialism, and Clerical reactionarism, but not a Mrs  Thatcher.
She's a British or American phenomena, in, um, ideology.
Um, so, even though people are not necessarily against Roman Catholicism today, they tend to think of it as somewhat foreign, or unusual.
This is mitigated of course, by the fact we have, mainly through Irish, and European immigration, a larger Roman Catholic element, than, we had for most of the period since fifteen sixty.
But, of course, before fifteen sixty, the idea that Roman Catholicism, was un-British, or un-English, would have been inconceivable.
So it's all a historical phase."
"Okay, once upon a time, there was a great American poet whose name was Ezra Pound.
Who left, a- America soon after graduating from college where he majored in the romance languages of English.
He had many, wonderful good points about him.
He discovered people like T-S Elliot and, uh, even before, uh... James Joyce's time.
He championed people like that.
He was, also... A little crazy.
During the second world war, Ezra Pound made broadcasts_ radio broadcasts from Rome.
Speaking in favor of Hitler, and Mussolini.
All the fascists and Nazis.
He had_ he said they had the right idea.
So of course when he was.
Collared near the end of the war.
The, um, Americans, um, had a trial for him.
He was found guilty, but in a way he couldn't serve, because he was judged insane.
Anybody who spoke that way about America, had to be nuts.
And so he was put in an insane asylum, in Wasington D-C called St Elizabeths.
He was here for many years, ten, fifteen years.
Until another trial found him sane, and he was allowed to come out.
He didn't live much longer after that.
He, uh, is very problematic with respect to things like his anti-Semitism - it's the most thing we can say about him, in a negative way.
But he didn't speak the truth all the time.
He told people that he could read music, and he had arranged, many medieval troubadour songs.
He did no such thing.
It's funny how greedy he was.
He has this great talent for writing books, poetry, his cantos.
And all_ even though they were very modern.
And it wasn't enough for him he had to show that he could, also, be a musician.
Which he wasn't.
It was obvious to others.
It was like Beethoven telling his friends_ his noble friends in Vienna that he was, a noble.
Ludwig van Beethoven, and it was a lie.
But Beethoven at the end was honest and, he, he acknowledged that he was a commoner.
I don't know about Ezra Pound.
I think he stuck to his weird ideas til the end.
But he was very helpful to, young poets who were, trying to make their way."
"I'd like to, uh, review some of the issues in, famine, and food security in Af_ in Africa.
Famine, is something which, has a very emotive, appeal, to westerners.
It's something which hasn't happened in Europe for, several hundred years now.
But it lingers in the background, overt conscious.
But, famine, in Africa, is something, which, which still exists, in many parts.
And I'm talking more about the drier regions.
Where production_ where agriculture production is very dependent on the, on the fickle rains.
Whether these come or not.
An important point I'd like to get over, is the fact that, the people who, live in these regions, are fully aware of this.
And that, they have agency.
They're_ are able to cope.
They don't, sit, down and wait, and die.
As perh_ is perhaps portrayed in some of the images, which have come out of Africa.
So... Looking at, the agricultural production, the cycle, it is important to see, agriculture, not as a way of life.
But, as a performance and how, it is so finely tuned to the, to the r_ the rains.
With the first rains, whenever they come.
There is no fixed date.
Their_ the fields are sowed.
And then, how, the mixture of crops planted in the field, is adjusted.
The, the inputs of labour are made throughout the season.
Depending on the rains, people will_ the production is, is, tu_ is, is as much as they're able to draw on labour resources.
And, and their health is strong and, and, other conditions apply.
And they're able to, to act, on the c- rainfall conditions, in their production.
Now when a, when a famine_ when a drought, I should say, comes along.
A drought does not necessarily mean famine at all.
Um, and there are definitely cases, when famines have occurred without drought, with agricultural production in abundance.
And there have been cases in Ethiopia of that.
Where analysis will show that, food was widely available, but, people weren't able to access it, because they didn't have money, or for whatever reasons, a war, or whatever.
But in a situation, where, the rains don't come.
How do people adjust.
Well, every year, people_ there are groups of people.
The poorer people, whose production, from the previous year, whether because they have so_ have had, bad luck.
Whether their holdings aren't sufficient.
Whether_ whatever reasons they haven't produced enough.
And there's what is called a hungry season or a_ in the French [xx], period.
Before the rains, when their, production from the year before is, is running low.
But at the same time there's, there's always, um, the wealthy people who, have had a good production.
And, looking at these, these uh, people, who on a year, year in year out basis, experience seasonal food shortage.
There's an instructive of, uh, of way, of seeing how, a famine situation will, will, will take over.
Now, there's a_ there's a_ people_ there's a lot of options out there.
I mean, living_ uncertainties are normal in the region.
An- and people, have a variety of ways of, adapting to that.
They may go out and, and collect wild berries.
Or, or sell some assets, particularly livestock.
Um, or, they ma_ they move out of the region, temporarily.
And seek work in, in cities, or something.
Um, they may seek loans, from friends.
Or, seek work, from the wealthier people in the village.
Now... When this happens_ starts to happen on, on a bigger scale.
The whole region is affected.
Those sources, which, these people rely on every year, become harder to find.
Everyone's out there looking for berries.
Everyone's in the cities, looking for, for work.
People, de-capitalise, a lot of their resources.
They sell they_ their, their animals.
People_ there is, an idea, that there is, uh, progresses as a_ sorry.
There's an idea that, what people do has kind of, a linear_ and a pattern to it.
People will first of all seek uh, seek um, fo_ wild foods, and they'll seek, um, loans, and then they'll sell their resources.
And, eventually, if it gets too bad, they will sell, their farm, or their means of production.
They'll sell their ploughs or, when th_ all the, uh, seed reserves.
And, and the ability to re- to return, after the famine event is over, is harder.
Whether, those strategies are employed in such a, a linear way, is, is debatable.
And, I would argue that it's not.
But, it's important to see that every, person's situation is different.
Whether they have, access to, friends, social networks, which they can borrow money from.
People_ there's winners and losers in famine situations.
There's people who do well.
Who's buying the land, who's buying those assets at that time.
Those people, people are doing well.
But... It is_ yeah, it is important to, to look at, not necessarily just famine.
Famine is, is the crisis which is, focused on by the media.
The images of... Of... S- skinny, starving people, in refugees' camps, just waiting for food.
Is the only thing that would jog the, the western, attention, to get aid.
But, you have to look beyond that to, more normal times.
When, there is, a section of society, often quite large, who have been able_ unable to recover from the last famine event.
Who now, perhaps are landless.
Or, have lost their herds.
And now, in forms of, production where they're, reliant on someone else.
They're reliant on those people who did well from, from the last famine.
They're now, in a different form of relationship.
And the thing is, after a famine, the conditions are not going to return to a- as they were before.
And this is ve_ an important fact, to bare in mind.
But, perhaps above all, is the fact that, people, live, with this situation.
Uncertainty is the norm in their lifestyles.
But, they have an ability, within re_ within dis_ within constraints, to, to, to, find their own livelihoods.
And they're not just passive victiMs  and that perhaps is, is the point of this."
"Recently I read, uh, The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner.
And... It_ I would have to say that it, it was the best book I've ever read.
Uh, it was the type that you pick up and you read straight through.
You can't put it down.
And, by the time you're finished with it you just never wanna even bother with any literary pursuits again because you are convinced that... Nothing ever needs to be written after, after that man put pen to paper.
But, uh, it's a book that I have been trying to get, a lot of my friends to read, and a lot of people get really discouraged with it after the first, section, because, the way the book is broken up.
It's four different people telling the story.
And the first person, who narrates is... Retarded and... Because of his_ because of the way he's perceiving the world_ the language is, is very confusing.
And, you know a lot of the people that I suggested, read this book, would read that whole first section and come back to me and say, ""you know I just_ I can't understand it.
I don't know what he's talking about.
I feel like_ I just can't follow it.""  but the thing that makes it so interesting to me is that... It's not just... It's not just that Faulkner is telling a story about a family, he's actually like putting you inside of, the characters in the story.
I mean, you're inside the experience when it 's the retarded... Son doing his narration.
You really feel like you're seeing the world through his eyes, I mean... It's his, it's thought process that you're, actually experiencing and it's, i- it's really interesting.
I mean I was pretty much hooked... Just after the first page.
Um... And it gets even better once, you get past the, the beginning narration, uh... By Benjy you get onto... The portion that's narrated by Quentin, who, i, I think he is probably one of my favorite characters in all of literature.
And... That was incredible.
I, I loved that whole portion of it.
And, the other two, siblings that... That did narrations were, Caddy and, uh... Then there was another, another guy, I can't remember his name but, uh... But it was really interesting.
I, I loved the whole thing that, that Faulkner did with time.
And the whole book, is sort of nonlinear in the way that it's put together, uh, because it's all talking about... All the different characters that narrate are talking about the same experiences.
But it's just filtered through different viewpoints.
And as result all the time's kind of mixed up.
But there's, constantly this referring back to, the idea of watches and, clocks.
And, i- it's just really insane.
It's, it's really hard, it's hard to articulat- hard to articulate almost, because the way that it happens is more like... The way that you dream or the way that you... You think more than the way that you talk.
So it's, i- it's really good.
It's, um... It's a lot of stream of consciousness.
I remember the first time I read Faulkner, I read uh... Intruder in the Dust, which was back in my sophomore or, freshman year of college.
And, I remember just being really daunted by the fact that he doesn't use periods, and he just has these... Run-on sentences.
And, I was just reading it and I was like ""man this is so disorientating I can't, you know I can't even figure out where he's going with this I i I forget where he started by the time I get to the end of it.""  so I was really thrown by it at first and i, I actually didn't like Faulkner that much.
I, I remember just being horrified at the prospect of having to read more of him.
And i, I more or less attribute this now to the fact that I was pretty young when I first picked him up.
Because uh, when I read The Sound and the Fury, i, i, was blown away.
I mean I was... I was really_ I was just really incredibly incredibly impressed.
I mean I think the thing about it_ the, the difference between  getting frustrated with Faulkner and just really loving him is you just have to kind of suspend, that part of you that expects... That expects to follow it as a logical story and you just have to, get into_ you just have to get into the experience.
You have to, you have to realize that he's trying to explain to you the way that the experience, smelled and the way it felt.
And the way that_ I don't know, just the way that ti, that it affected different people in different ways.
He's not trying to bring you blow by blow through, through a story.
I mean, he wants you to realize that all these experiences are very subjective.
And... You know, just the fact that he writes so much about families I think is i- incredibly interesting.
Because... I think that the way that a family interacts... Is so telling as far as... How it, you know how you define with the person.
I mean, y- you grow up in an environment where... You pretty much are defined by the people around you and the way that you interact with them.
And feel like, a lot of times in literature... And, you know, events and situations get described, completely separate from the context of... You know, the family setting.
But I mean I can't think of a day that goes by when i, i, I'm not somehow affected by... Someway that I was in my family or someway that my family... Raised me to be.
And I think the fact that Faulkner realizes that everyone is a product of that kind of, an environment.
And in some cra- in some cases it's a really crippling environment and in some cases it's, it's not.
I- it's hardly ever simple.
I think the fact that he, he just really honors that whole idea it really impressed me.
And... I i mean it's, it's something that I also noticed in another book that I really liked, As I Lay Dying... Which, uh, which was also about another very dysfunctional family... Living in the south.
But, um, I i it's something that I think that a lot of people can't really sink their teeth into.
But it's it's so worth reading.
I mean... I think that you almost have to put it off though, until you're, until you're a little bit older.
I mean if if I could go back now and, reread what I read when I was eighteen, I think I would probably get a lot more out of it than I did, when I was that age, because, I mean when you are in high school you're you're accustomed to stories happening in a certain way and when you're hit with something like that you just don't know what to do with it first.
And I think it takes a little bit, more emotional, emotional maturity to, you know, accept that you're reading something that you can't necessarily do a book report on, but you might be able to get something out of emotionally."
"Do consultants have a big people problem.
It is an incredible thought, the world doesn't have enough consultants.
Awash in business, firms are on the hiring binge.
But top M-B-A's don't love them, the way they used to.
Intruders of questionable value, unqualified busine- busybodies, with little practical experience.
That's how corporate executives often seem to view the management consultants their companies hire.
Yet company_ as they do_ companies_ yet complain as they do, companies just can't get enough of consultants.
And are hiring them like never before.
Result.
What's the result.
The consulting industry's enjoying it's biggest boon, since the game began.
The finding of author (D.
Litter) in eighteen-eighty-six.
Revenues are up, to forty-four percent in the past two years, a growth rate somewhere north of Mercks and the fun is far from over.
Business should grow fifteen percent or more_ more avenue for the next several years.
Consulting firm_ even the largest, and the most prestigious face an acute shortage of their principle asset, people.
The trouble is that as demand for consul- consultants is surging.
Consulting is becoming less cool among M-B-A's.
The percentage of graduates at top business school going into consulting has slide for the past two years.
Students say, they would rather work for venture capital firms, or fast growing high tech companies, that don't pay as much to start, but offer more responsibility, and a potential windfall in stock ofi- options down the road.
This article... Reflects some concept... We learn in problem-solving and decision-making, and planning and control.
Problem-solving is the process of eliminating the discrepancy between actual and desired outcomes.
A major responsibility for all managers, is to maintain the constant look out for actual or potential probleMs  next the problem needs to be defined and analyzed.
Then alternative sol- solutions need to be generated.
Decision-making is the step in the problem-solving process that entails choosing the best solution from several alternatives.
Individual, managerial and organizational success, all depend on making the right decision at the right times.
Finally the solution needs to be imp- implemented.
Consultants have a big people problem.
When they find them, that every consulting firm pursue the same kind of people, smart, creative, presentable.
And they're in short supply.
They decide to develop other alternatives, with top M-B-A's in short supply, consultants are looking further afield.
Max- Maxine recruits talented graduates from other disciplines in the program, a double natural at that.
It looks for people with doctors and physics and elec- electr- electronical, and mechanical engineering.
And it has begun visiting the campuses of five law schools and formatical schools and well as Oxford and Cambridge.
Price Waterhouse is also casting a wide- wider net.
It pays a finders fee to employees who bring in new hires.
Young M-B-A's now cost so much, that they don't start_ start making the profit contribution until their second year on the job.
But senior partners can't do all the work, because clients baulk at their rates of five thousand dollars a day, or more.
Firms have to figure, figure out ,how to pay their own people enough not to quit.
But not so much that clients scream.
One solution is to find new source of revenue.
(Medium Madison) likes to, take some of its fees from clients in the form of ownership in new business it helps to create.
Going public, is another way to reward employees without socking it to the customers.
By capitalizing earnings, firms, can compensate consultants with stock, and options.
Techno- technology is a drive of organization change.
Technology encompasses desig- scientific knowledge process- processes systems and equipment, used to create products and services, and to help people carry out their tasks.
How did it come to pass that first year consultants, are commanding more than the smartest young lawyer, and doctors.
The root cause of this, as of so much of today's econ- economic turmoil, is the stress and strain, of  adapting to the digital revolution.
Traditional consultants like Maxine and Boston consulting groups still prosper, by selling strategics advice.
Which companies in the digital econ- economy need plenty of.
But the biggest source of new business is de- the nuts and bolts of Infotech.
Companies want consultants to install a system, develop global infor- information networks, and solve the year two thousand problem.
In many cases consultants stick around to operate the computer, once they are installed.
Providing a steady stream of revenues.
Most consulting firms, will have to rethink deeply the way they do business.
Adapting to the demands of a fast changing digital age.
Can the physics help themselves.
The world is better off it they do.
So we should all hope they solve their problem.
Even if a few business people will get a certain wicked pleasure from seeing them struggle with it."
"Forestry in West Africa, and the story of trees in the European imagination.
Visitors, from Europe, when they saw a s- savannah landscape, an ad hoc mixture of grasses and trees.
They, initially, thought, that the region, had been deforested.
And the remaining_ those trees that were there, were the remainders, of, what was once a great forest.
And the colonial powers, because of this line of thinking, imposed often quite draconian measures, on, controlling, um, the exploitation, of forest resources.
The way they approached it, was particularly alien, to local production.
They often formed_ both the French and the British, a forestry department, and ,an agricultural_ a separate agricultural department.
Which is very different, to local production.
Trees are often part of the production system.
The trees, would be left growing in the field.
Or, perhaps even purposefully planted.
But they're, an integral part of the overall production system.
They're not different.
Now, some of the laws were particularly... Particularly harsh in parts of Guinea.
Um, the death penalty was there_ existed, for anyone, cutting down certain trees.
And the forestry resources, particularly of the southern countries in West Africa along the coast, were of immense economic importance.
And, uh, there's a large trade in, in these resources.
So, it was in the interest of the colonial powers to co- control these.
But, when it comes to the savannah lands, where the forest ends, and the grass- grasses start to appear amongst the trees.
This is where, the Europeans had a problem.
They, just kept, seeing, um, trees, where trees didn't exist.
And not understanding why they didn't exist.
And there was, a strong, misunderstanding of the landscape.
And recent research in Guinea has shown that, these islands of trees, are not remnants, of, a, what_ the former forest.
They are actually, trees which have been planted, by, people, in what was once purely an open savannah region.
Completely the opposite.
And, around people's houses, and in, the remains of villages which have moved on.
In the richer soil in those regions from sa_ uh, midden heaps, and, um, all the detritus from, from living.
And actually provided a rich focus for the trees to grow in.
So, there was a fundamental misconception of trees there.
But, um, savannahs_ understanding the savannahs, has increased recently.
And, fire which was so often controlled.
Strongly by the colonial powers, and by the post-colonial governments, as well.
Is actually, a key factor in the ecology of the region.
Savannahs, are affected by five determinants.
Water availability.
Fire.
Herbivores.
Um, and anthropogenic events.
And that's four, and I can't leave the fifth one, ha ha.
Um, oh, and, availability of soil nutrients.
But, whether these_ how these five factors inter-react and, create the landscape, is going to vary across time and space.
But, fire was so often controlled.
As was, um, human activity.
And also, grazing as well.
All have been controlled by, governments, and states.
Without, proper understanding of, of the dynamics of the vegetation.
Their_ the Europeans for so long, continued to see the trees, where the trees did not necessarily grow."
"Recently I got my pilot's license.
Um, a private pilot for a single engine land aircraft.
That's basically anything with one prop- propeller engine, that takes off and lands on land as opposed to water, that's like a hydrocraft or something.
And I got into it because of, uh, my chemistry teacher in high school.
He was an instructor, and he was completely fanatical about it.
And he was telling all of his students about it.
And actually started a course in it.
So I went on a aviation science_ it's basically like ground school.
Which is good because i_ because then_ he encouraged me and I went to the local airport.
And, uh_ the local airport, Morristown airport.
And... I took a discovery flight for, like 20 dollars or something.
And they take you_ and they take you out, and they fly you around.
But when you're in the air, they'll let you actually handle it.
And, uh, it was pretty cool.
And it was like a beautiful day when we did it, and the instructors were really nice, so I signed up right away to be on my track to getting my license.
And, they said it'd take about a year, or a little more.
Some people take lot longer.
There's a minimum of fifty-five hours of flight time, and you need twenty-five hours instructed, and thirty hours solo, minimum.
And then, you have other restrictions, such as you need to do review time, and you have to do solo time, night time, flying at night and all that stuff.
So... I started off and, I was doing pretty good, and my instructor's  really nice.
And we never really went over any of the actual physics about the flying, which is good because I kind of covered that in a high school class that my, chemistry teacher was teaching.
So that was really excellent.
But then, it was about a month and a half before I was supposed to get my license and I was actually going off to college.
I was planning going off to college around the same time, that I should have got my license.
My actual instructor he left, to go somewhere else.
So I got a new instructor.
My new instructor took me out, and he was saying_ so, he started quizzing me on the stuff that I should know.
And I was like, ""i don't know any of this.""  he's like ""don't you know any of this.""  and I said ""no.""  and he's like, ""well, you're supposed to have learned the ground school material, like every lesson.""  and he's like_ he expected that_ my old instructor had said like learn this chapter for then.
And i, I hadn't done any of that.
And I had to take a written test, on all the theory behind the flying.
The first_ the complete prerequisite to any part of getting your license.
So I had to completely cram for that, in a week.
Luckily I passed the written test.
I got an eighty-two.
You had to get a seventy or above to pass.
Eighty-two is nothing, uh, to be proud of actually.
It's a pretty easy test.
But I'm, i_ eighty-two is fine with me.
And so then, I had to go_ and then i_ and then, uh, it turned out that I had to, do extra flying time because they changed the regulations on getting a license, a week before_ a week_ it was a week before I was going to get my license.
So it turned out that I had to do, uh, five hours extra of flying.
So I couldn't get that all in before I went off to college.
So then, I tried to come back on the weekends to keep flying with my instructor to get extra time in.
It was really a hassle.
And that took, another five months afterwards.
So finally I got everything_ all my requi- requirements done.
And i, uh, I flew, uh, flew solo flights to other airports around.
I had to do an extended flight for like, uh, I think it was three hundred total miles.
I mean, you kind of worry about that your plane is just going to fall from the sky after a while.
But it never does.
So that's cool.
So I got to my,i got my test.
I had to fly somewhere else to take my test.
So I soloed over to the airport, picked up my instructor, did a little oral exam, he started asking me_ shooting questions at me.
I studied for that so I passed that pretty well.
And so he takes me up in the plane.
And the first thing he does is_ he says, ""pretend that you just lost your radio, you can't use those anymore"" directional radios."" you are on a cross country flying towards a destination.""  and I was going, and I completely, flipped out and I 'd no idea what I was supposed to do.
Cuz, I just, uh, I completely blanked on that one.
I was like ""this is not a good way to start.""  regardless, I failed the test the first time.
So I had to come back.
I was completely heart broken because no one ever fails these tests.
It was_ I mean people do_ it's not like people ever look down on you like, failing some other kind of test.
I mean it is a hard test.
So I was very broken up about that, and I was going to throw in the towel, but then... My family was like, we're not wasting all this money, for you not to get your stinking license.
Cuz, all in all it probably totals about a little over three thousand dollars to get your license in total.
So I went back, I think about a_ it was a week later, I had to have taken another lesson between there.
There's always, like, stinking regulations that don't make any sense sometimes.
I went up again, we only had to do just the parts that I just failed.
So I had to do some stalls, which are nerve wracking, and they make, uh_ they make me sick in my stomach.
And hate really doing them.
But he had me do,about eight in a row.
And I was really glad that we stopped at the point when we did, cuz I was feeling pale and cold.
And not in good condition.
But he says, ""all right you've passed just land the plane, and you're good.""  and I did and I got my license.
So I've had it for nine months now.
Yeah nine months.
And I haven't flown much since then, but, I'm planning on going to the nearby airport here at college, and getting my, and getting checked out there so I can fly out a few of my friends.
Maybe we'll go to Atlantic City or something and gamble all of our money away."
"As a graduate student at Princeton University in the, uh, French Language and Literature Department.
Uh, I’d like to speak more about my experience there.
Uh, typically what happens is I have about three seminars per semester.
Now a semester would be from let's say, uh, September to December.
That would be the first semester, fall semester.
And a second semester during the academic year would typically be from January to let's say, uh, May or so.
And during dur- during that time, you have_ during a seminar actually, what happens is there is quite a bit of interaction between the professors and the students.
Um, the professors encourage active participation, uh, on behalf on_ active participation_ the the professors encourage active participation in class.
You have to come prepared, you have to have done your reading, which is typically quite a bit of reading.
Uh, I would say.
For example, uh, many times I would have to come to seminars having read about four or five different books.
Each of which was, um, three hundred, four hundred pages long.
You must have_ do your reading, you must talk actively in class, be alert, uh, be prepared for, um, professors asking questions.
And there is also quite a bit of interaction with fellow students I would say.
Um, and, um, there is a lot of active dialogue back and forth, professors, students, etceteras.
And the seminars are typically about three hours long, and they occur once a week for each class.
And I would think that it’s pretty specialized.
I mean I received a Master's Degree in French Language and Literature from Princeton, in fact this past January.
And I majored in_ I specialized in nineteenth century French literature.
For that it was, uh, a two year program.
And, uh, it was very rigorous, extremely intensive.
And in addition to attending class regularly, in fact class was mandatory, you had to go to class and you_ unless you were absolutely sick.
You really had to be there.
It was pretty much like a job, I would say.
Not just school, but like a job.
You have to be there, you have to be punctual, prepared at all times.
And I also had to do teaching.
Teaching was a very important of the degree as a, as a matter of fact.
Teaching would generally be every day.
I had to teach one hour per day.
And I had to prepare about two hours for each hour that I taught.
I taught beginning French language courses.
For example i, I taught French one-oh-one and French one-oh-two.
Now I taught Princeton University undergraduates who were extremely bright and hardworking.
And I very much enjoyed my experience teaching.
Basically I taught the whole class from start to finish.
I prepared the lectures, I created the assignments.
I even helped design the syllabi.
It was quite a bit of responsibility, but it was actually an excellent teaching experience.
And it was, it was very invaluable in fact for me.
Uh, besides these, um, these requirements for teaching and for, uh, being in seminars, of course, you also had_ um, your active attendance in lectures, lectures were a very important part of the experience as well.
Generally the department had people come over from all over the world, very famous professors.
People who are at the top of their field, come over and give lectures about their work, about, um, their current research etcetera, and they would just talk about wh- their books, give book readings.
And, um, it was very important.
It was very essential to the learning process as well because we really needed_ you really need to, um, interact with other professors who were from other schools all over the world, to really know what’s going on in the field.
You see.
And I thought that that was, um, very invaluable actually to my, uh, learning experience.
Lectures were were pretty much mandatory, I mean it was sort of not stated that it was mandatory, but basically that meant that you had to be there, at all times, really.
And I really enjoyed my experience.
In fact I love French literature, it was fascinating and I enjoyed it because I got to specialize in a particular field, particular period.
And also with professors who, who though they were very busy were very involved with their students.
They would guide you not only academically, but also psycholog- psychologically to a certain extent.
And they were friends.
I mean you could talk with them, you could have a coffee, you could have lunch with them.
It was a very personal experience and it was very important, not only to get along well academically with everyone, but also I think socially.
You see it it was a small department.
Uh, I think my year there were about let's say six students.
And we all knew each other very well.
We required a lot of partici- participation and there was quite a lot of cooperation.
Especially cooperation I mean between the professors and students, and between the students as well.
And I think there wasn't as much cutthroat competition as there would be at other schools.
Because at Princeton, um, it was a small department and there were only a, a few students each year.
So I think it it just became very much like a family.
And I enjoyed that aspect very much.
And you also had the opportunity of course, to  um, to li- meet people from other departments and to_ that is very important so that you can really get a perspective of pe- of, um, people who work in let’s say different fields.
For example English literature which is still closely related.
You need to interact with people from different departments to enhance your learning experience both academically and socially.
And all in all yes, I i did enjoy my experience.
However, it’s very different from i’d say college.
Extremely different in all the ways imagined.
The workload is extremely rigorous.
I mean I i’d say I worked extremely hard.
Uh, you ha- basically had one paper due per semester for each class.
And let's say one presentation per semester for each class as well.
And basically the, uh, paper counted for the whole grade.
Grades are not that important at_ it’s different from college.
The grades are important to get in of course.
But once you are in you are in.
And the grades take on less, less importance.
What is important however, is, uh, is the research.
How well you do research.
Your writing skills are extremely important.
Also your presentation.
Um, in terms of your um_ the impression you give the professors, not just the work you do.
But you've got to give them the impression that you are very bright.
And that you're going to be a future scholar I would say, is extremely essential.
And they are there to guide you.
Uh, I enjoyed my experience and, um, what I would recommend to anyone who is interested is that they seriously think about, what they want to do.
What field they want to pursue.
And also, um, how long they want to take doing it.
And getting a Master's for me was practical because afterwards you know getting a Master's, it’s only for two years.
Then I can go on and go work.
However Ph.
D.
Program which typically takes five years in my department_ people who get a Ph.
D.
Generally have a lot of problems getting jobs.
, Because once you have a Ph.
D.
You pretty much have to become a professor and right now in the field of French language and literature, it is extremely difficult to get a position.
Especially one that is tenured.
It is not necessarily true for every department, but at least in French language and literature it seems to be the case.
In fact the top students from my department, uh, actually even from Princeton it is difficult to find a job.
A tenure track position anywhere in the country right now.
So whoever pursues an advanced degree should think carefully about it.
Especially if that is a Ph.
D.
You should consider the, um, many requirements for one.
The length of time, uh, difficulty of getting a position and, um, see if that is what you want.
All I all, it was a tremendous learning experience academically, socially, psychologically.
And, um, graduate school was something that I didn't quite expect at the beginning, in terms of I i thought it would be much easier than actually turned out to be.
It is much much harder.
Much is demanded, much is expected and it really is a job more than school I would say."
"I'd like to talk about, doing historical research.
Um, nowadays I'm very used to it.
But, thirty years ago, as a first year postgraduate, it was quite a shock.
The jump from undergraduate work.
Taking your bachelor's degree, to postgraduate work, um, was quite a shock.
More, I think, for, somebody doing history.
Than, say, from scientists.
I talk to my friends who are scientists.
Now, an undergraduate scientist, spends a lot of time in the lab, doing experiments.
And, when he or she does postgraduate work, um, there's more of a continuity.
They still continue to do experiments.
But, in a more, detailed, presumably, more ambitious way.
I won't go into this any further, because, um, one certain thing you can say about me, is I'm not a physical scientist.
Ha ha.
But, with history, as a, student.
As an undergraduate student, you have reading lists.
You have a list_ the wo_ well, certainly in my day.
Your tutor gives you a list of secondary sources.
I.
E.
Books published the people.
Which means that other people have done the research.
He says, 'go away and read them.
' So, if you're conscientious, that's what you do.
You take notes on them.
And then, from your notes you, produce a good, sound essay, answer.
If you're not so conscientious, you pretend you've done that.
You read one and a half of them, instead of, um, all eight of them.
But, either way, the principle is the same.
Then, suddenly, you are thrown into postgraduate work.
And, what's the difference.
Well, you find, that, you have to look at the original sources.
The actual seventeenth century material.
Or, it could be fourteenth century material.
It doesn't matter really.
It could be written in old English, medieval Latin, old French.
But, you're with the original material.
I always think it's a bit like the, um, inner city kid, who thinks that you buy milk in cartons from the, um, supermarket.
And then goes into the depths of the countryside, finds to his shock, that milk comes from a dirty smelly old animal.
And secondly, that if he is to have any milk.
Anything to eat.
Anything to sustain himself.
He is going to have to learn to milk this animal by hand.
No one's even going to milk it for him.
Ha ha.
Now, what are these documents like.
Well, I can only describe my personal experience.
I won't describe what it's like to read twelfth century Latin documents, because I haven't done it.
Well, um, number one, they're written_ you get some printed resource_ uh, sources, of course.
Sorry, I should have said sources, not, resource.
Well, it could be either actually.
Printed resources.
Um, or sources.
Of course, they're relatively easy to read.
But, printing was, surprisingly, um, rare.
There was no typewriter then.
In_ even in the late seventeenth  century.
So most of the documents, even legal documents, are in somebody's hand.
And, the quality of the handwriting varies a great deal.
Some of them are beautiful copperplate, and easy to read.
Others are idiosyncratic.
Um, in fact, handwriting, as today, was already in three hundred years ago, idiosyncratic.
Which was paradoxically, not true of the middle ages, when there was a conventional script.
So, if you look at a, uh, a page of medieval writing, in medieval Latin.
You discover two things.
You probably can't _ you certainly won't be able to read it straight off.
But, if you know Latin, and you master the conventions of that script.
It's probably easier to wr_ read, in many ways.
Than something written in the, late seventeenth century, in English, or French.
I was ambitious, I decided to do a topic in French history, social study of country gentry, in, a French province.
So, I also had to, um, get my French up to speed.
So I imposed a lot of problems on myself.
Um, so that's the first thing.
Um, the handwriting is idiosyncratic, but not necessarily idiosyncratic in the way, that we are idiosyncratic today.
Um, next is the quality of the surviving documents.
All sorts of things can go wrong with them.
They could have faded.
Um, there could be holes in them.
Blots in them.
Before they were rescued by the, archivist, and, um, put into proper order.
They could have been lying in someone's damp cupboard, for a hundred years, even longer.
They could have been eaten by rats.
They could have been defecated on by birds.
All sorts of things.
Yes.
So, there's a physical problem as well.
Then, there's a problem in interpretation.
The questions, that the, researcher wants to ask, are, by no means, necessarily, um, the, obsessions, or subjects of the contemporaries themselves are addressing.
Well seventeenth century people, themselves, are addressing, in these documents.
They have their own agenda.
Their own purposes.
Give you, [throat clear] one fairly straightforward example.
The, the returns of sur- surveys, for the xx xx [aria ban].
Don't pretend you've heard of the xx xx [aria ban] you probably haven't.
But it was a way of both taxing, and forcing, military service out of country gentlemen, in the late seventeenth century, that the King of France used.
When they were dodging the column.
When they were not serving as officers in the regular army.
At times because of pressure of war, he wanted all hands on deck.
Or, all hands in the field.
Um, they actually served as, sort of, home guard.
But, all the chaps in a certain area, are listed, um, can they pay a tax and commutation.
Or are they fit to serve personally.
And sometimes they're just listed.
Um, that tells you something.
Usually, their income is listed.
But you always want their income.
And sometimes you don't get it.
That's what you're looking for, is their income.
And sometimes it's not mentioned.
Usually it is.more fascinating, sometimes, personal observations are made about them.
[Throat clear] 'uh, we won't have [Monsieur De Seale Hull], he's, he's drunk too much of the time, you know, he's too incompetent.
Not fit to serve.
' Someone else, however, is a brave, zealous, and experienced officer.
The thing is_ uh, who has formerly served in the regular armies.
The thing is, however, you want that all the time, those comments.
And, you only get them for certain people.
Other people are just names.
There's no_ there's nothing to make them live like that, sort of thing.
Um, other things_ I have a large cache of personal letters.
Personal correspondence, from a family called the [Phillipe du Perde].
Equivalent, all the much later, to the much better known Kuxton Letters of the English fifteenth century.
Same gentry environment, but, [throat clear] three hundred years_ is it three hundred.
Sorry.
Just over two hundred years later, and in France, not England.
They're also Huguenot family.
They are messed up, um, partly fractured the revocation of the Edict of Nante, refusing to tolerate Protestants anymore, sixteen eighty-five.
So, this might sound good.
Surely personal letters make people live vividly.
They do.
But, of course, in personal letters, you don't even have the convention, agree to gender, of a legal document.
In a personal letter, you can write what you like.
So a lot of it, is elusive.
People refer_ the correspondents refer to other people they know, or are related to.
But the make muffling comments about them.
Someone described using caches of personal correspondence, for historical research, as like looking through a hole in the fence, at a football game.
There you are, maybe like a small boy, you you're fascinated by this game.
Perhaps you can't afford a ticket.
So you've crept off, and you're looking through a hole in the fence.
But you can see some of the players, very vividly.
Some of the players, very marginally.
And quite a lot of them, not at all.
So, sometimes, when you get references to events, in isolation, you don't know what's happened.
Um, when there's cheering or booing, say in the football game, you don't know who's cheering, or booing.
It can be like that, for_ uh, when you have caches of personal letters, where people are not on oath.
They haven't even been given a remit by the government to, um, do a list of people's income.
So, the, the, um, problems in doing historical research.
I'm not qualified to talk about other research, are formidable.
You've got to have a clear, um, view of what questions you want to ask.
What you want to get out of the documents.
Um, you've got to, then, find out how documents, which were not written with you in mind.
How could they be.
Can be used to answer that.
Uh, those questions.
You have to tease it out of those documents.
Um, and you get, say, fifteen percent of the answers from one set of documents.
Maybe another ten percent, from another.
Thirdly, the documents themselves can be in any sort of condition.
And, fourthly, you then find that your original set of questions have to be modified.
Either they just can't be answered, some of them.
The evidence isn't there.
Or, they're simply the wrong question.
You know, um, you might um, have in, in our own life, you might find, 'why is, why is Aunt, Aunt Meg, terribly interested in baseball.
' Whereas you find you've been misinformed, she's not terribly interested in baseball.
Ha ha.
You know, if you want to know more about Aunt Meg, you have to go off on another track."
"Irrigation, in West Africa.
The, seasonal, variation in rainfall, variability, in the, the dry regions of West Africa, has fo_ for centuries, led people to, develop means, of, achieving a reliable access to water, throughout the year.
Naturally, this is focused on, on sites which, actually retain the water, fo_ throughout the dry season.
So, groundwater reserves, or, permanent lakes, which occasionally can be found in the region.
And exploit the water from there, through, various systems of, uh, runoff_ well not what_ sorry not runoff, um, lifting the water, and, and applying it, to, to the fieldson the small scale, yeah, it is possible at small population densities_ to, to achieve some level of food security.
By wa_ by water security.
But, since independence of many of the_ of the nations in the sixties.
There, there was, or there have been, much grand_ grander schemes of irrigation.
Particularly focusing in, on the two great rivers in the region.
The Senegal and the River Niger, or the Niger River.
And with the, the optimism, immediately after independence in the sixties.
And also, the, the_ what remains of, of the colonial, input.
There was, a great desire, to build large-scale schemes, to dam these rivers.
To hold back the water, to make it available, throughout, throughout the year.
So that certain regions could become the bread basket.
Like, the inland delta of the Niger.
Or, along the Senegal Valley, in Northern Senegal.
Now the, the various problems were that, water, is a key resource for, not only agriculture.
It's a, a grazing res_ uh, important for, for pe_ uh, livestock production, to water animals.
And also, as a fishing resource.
And these big schemes_ and they were big.
And, they were_ there was a lot of money which was made available.
Partly due to the, the climate of, optimism that existed at the time.
A lot of money was invested into these schemes.
But, looking at them now, the, the people who have benefited from them, and the actual, downstream effects_ whether they, match, the, the development money put in in the first place.
And whether they have achieved their goals, is very questionable.
With the, the high temperatures, in the region, the irrigation, water, a lot of it, is, is lost through evaporation.
Um, water use is particularly inefficient, I think, something in the order, of ni_ nine litres is lost, for every one litre of water, that arrives at the plant.
And with the, with the evaporation, salts, in the, in the soil, are brought up to the surface, salinising the soil.
And, making future production, difficult, if not impossible.
But beyond those technical constraints, and inefficiencies, there are other problems as well.
Forms of labour organisation had to be changed, to maximise, a crop.
Such as rice, which, is, i- in some regions a new crop to be grown.
There, there is many thoughts that rice, originated in, inland Niger_ uh, inland delta of the Niger.
Wild rice.
But, growing it, on these mass irrigated farms, with plots laid out.
And the need for, for credit to get fertilisers and, the con_ continuous cropping, required year in year out.
Totally alters the production.
But, the, the alterations it causes, go beyond just the production.
The health environment changes.
More water, more mosquitoes, more malaria.
Uh, with, with the water, there's Schistosomiasis, or bilharzia as it is also known, through the snails, in the water.
Um... But... What the valley lines were used for in the past_ they were_ the water, which came down, down these rivers, after the rains.
The flood that it caused, the traditional way of utilising that excess water.
Was, as the flood receded, they'd plant in the, in the banks, or the flood plain.
So as the water_ and the soil held the water.
Clay soils in the valley bottom.
And as the, the water retreats, the wa-, the soil holds the moisture.
And gradually, um, it dries out.
But, there's at least an opportunity to, to exploit that water over, over a period.
But those, areas are also, key areas for, for grazing.
But, the sudden di_ displacement brought on by these large scales in, in the_ along the Senegal River, and the Niger, have, have disenfranchised a lot of people.
People have come in, from outside, from the, from the cities.
From wealthy areas, and brought the land, and changed... The_ people's access to these resources.
The, people are now reliant on credit and the fertilisers.
Whole means of production, is changed.
To, to bring this discussion, to an end, perhaps, we should look beyond the simple, equation that, there's not enough food because there's not enough water.
Therefore, we need water.
And that we have to, consider, that, providing that resource, in such, a way, as irrigation.
Large scale irrigation, will bring a lot of, a lot of changes.
And that they, really need to be thought through a lot more, before, before being implemented.
And then, question, the wisdom of actually, going for such large scales.
I mean, if you, accounted for everything, is there a positive balance, brought about by this money.
That's an important question."
"I'm going to try to describe to you, what my research actually entails.
I'm working for a department of archaeology.
And as you know, whenever archaeologists excavate things, a common item that they find is bone.
Um, bone survives, uh, diagenesis which are processes the occur after death.
Much better than any other body tissues.
Therefore, it's a material which quite a lot of research is carried out on.
Currently, if you look at a piece of bone, and you analyse its chemicals, you can find out whether people were vegetarians or carnivores.
Whether herbivores, or grazers or browsers.
You can determine whether people ate C-3 or C-4 plants.
Which means you can tell when people moved from a wheat to a maize agriculture.
And it's, astonishing the number of different, uh, uses thi- this can be put to.
I'm going to analysing nitrogen carbon and hydrogen in the bones.
Specifically in bone collagen.
Which is the protein which holds, bone together.
The other part of bone is, uh, maybe carbonaceous material.
Um, that's all the calcium, and the mineral part, which provides the strength.
We dissolve the mineral away.
And take the collagen.
And then it gets sprung on an instrument called a mass spectrometer.
And this burns the protein into it's_ individual atoms and we can analyze the atoms that we collect.
Each atom has a different number of isotopes.
Which means, um, that it will have different numbers of protons or neutrons in its nucleus.
Which means that it has a different number of neutrons in its nucleus which, give it a slightly different weight.
Because the atom has a different weight.
It will react differently in biochemical reactions.
So, something like evaporation or the lighter isotopes would evaporate preferentially to the heavier isotopes.
This enables us to look at the ratios of the different isotopes.
And from that we can deduce what the original atoms actually came from.
This is how we can tell, whether, somebody ate plants, or animals.
Because plants and animals have a different basic ratio to themselves.
One thing that we can't tell is when somebody ate freshwater fish.
Now because water has a lot of old carbon in it.
From things like rock, on the beds of rivers, which dissolves into the water.
It's very, very difficult to use radio carbon dating, to get an accurate date for the bones of the burial.
By analysing, the isotopic ratios of hydrogen in the bone collagen.
We are hoping to be able to tell when somebody had a diet which included freshwater fish.
If possible, we want to find out how much of their diet, was made up of freshwater fish.
And therefore, we can have some idea of how many extra years may have been put on the radio carbon date.
At the moment the research is in very initial stages.
We're currently trying to collect samples from a whole range of animals.
And we'll be analysing the bone collagen of the animal bones to, see whether there's any effect across trophic levels.
I.
E.
If one animal eats another animal, how does the ratio change, up into the animal that consumed the meat.
All of the animals we analyse have generally been killed on the roads by traffic.
Or sometimes some of them have been poisoned in fields by rat bait or something like that.
And museums act as quite a good store for animals like this, fo-, that we can collect.
Um, many people take in animals that they find, to museums if they have taxidermy sections.
And what the taxidermist doesn't want, people like myself collect to analyse.
We're comparing, two different ecosysteMs  we're comparing the terrestrial ecosystem.
We're we using things like mice and voles.
Right up to birds of prey, and foxes and other higher carnivores.
And we're go_ compare the data that we get from those, with, organisms from a fresh water ecosystem.
And there we'll be analysing types of fish.
And birds which eat fish.
Such as herons.
Um, it's a lot more difficult to get, a good food work in the aquatic side.
Whereas terrestrial mammals are very commonly studied and there are therefore very many groups which already have collections of animals.
Which can provide us with bones without having to, have to search too hard.
In the carbon and nitrogen we can tell when marine foods were eaten.
Uh, marine fish gives a very definite signal.
The carbon isotope ratios.
But, unfortunately freshwater looks exactly the same as terrestrial food.
So, carbon and nitrogen are not actually being measured, for the strict purpose of this research.
Only the hydrogen will be of any use to us.
If indeed, it does tell us anything.    "
"I would like to, now explore some of the issues in, livestock production in dry land Africa.
Now firstly, why i_ are the dry lands of Africa, particularly good for livestock production.
Well... One, one issue, that's very important, is that, though the production is not,in terms of g- grass, and and, and foliage is not as high, as it is in the more tropical, forest regions.
The actual... Possibility for_ for, um, livestock to live there, is better.
Because, of the lack of disease generally.
Tsetse fly in particular, is abundant in, in the more southern regions.
So, that's one of the, the main limits to why, livestock are found in, in the northern dry regions.
Now in these regions, which are typically savannah lands, you have a mixture, of trees, and grasses.
An important element which determines particularly the, the amount of grass available, is_ are the rains.
Now these have a, a temporal and spatial dynamic.
They_ there's a def_ in the West African Sahel there's a defined, um, rainy season.
Generally between, um, June and, mid-September, when the rains come.
Or, normally come.
But, not always.
And where_ it's incredible how, the rain will fall, in one region, and, in the village next door, there will be no rain at all.
Now the advantage of livestock production is such rain, and region.
Is that you can actually_ they move.
You can move the animals around, to find this, um, these resources.
Now, apart from grazing.
The actual_ what they eat.
There's also a req- a requirement to water the animals.
So, uh, knowledge of where, seasonal pools are, or wells, where th- the animals can be watered... Is essential.
So the m- the basic components of, of the systems are, a requirement for fod_ food, and water.
And, m- a mobility element as well, is important.
Now traditionally, there have been, certain groups of people, who have specialised, more so, in livestock production.
And particularly in, in West Africa.
The, the Filani and the, the Twarec, stand out, as, um, particularly pastoral groups.
Have expertise in this.
There's a slight difference between, th- them.
Th- the Twarec poten_ uh, generally tend to, be more, into producing camels.
Which a- again are a hardier animal than, than cattle.
So they can, um, stay in, in the dry regions for_ throughout the year.
But some of the Filani have, have certain types of cattle, which can't actually eat dry grass.
I mean as soon as the rains are finished, the grass becomes very parched and straw-like.
And th- the nutritional value is very limited.
And then for cattle_ there're some types of cat- cattle that is, um, that is not good for them.
And they actually had to be taken south.
They retreat, with the rains, to the south.
Um... Whereas others_ um, other types of cattle.
And particularly small stock, like sheep and goats, can, survive, on dry grass.
And also leaves, of trees and shrubs.
I think it's very unusual, in the w_ in the uh, temperate realm, to see, um, uh, sheep and goats eating leaves off trees.
But this is how they survive in, in the Sahel, throu- through the, through the dry period.
Now... The way, the people, survive, through livestock production, is probably a myth that they've ever survived entirely on it.
They exchange their products from livestock production, with the farming community.
And there's an interesting relationship between the two.
The, agricultural population, will, exchange grains, for, for, milk and meat and hides.
And th- there's also, a benefit seen by the um, by the agricultural population for, for ma- for manure, from the animals, as an important input into the_ maintaining the soil fertility.
Now, there's cl_ there's problems with the relationship.
Um, a field of meat_ uh, a field of, sorry, a field of millet, would be, um, very, very good for a, ha ha, for a cow to eat, ha ha.
But that's obviously not desirable.
So... There's issues involved in, in where, cattle can be taken.
And animals can be taken, during the rains.
Often they move far up north, which is away from the, the areas, of_ where agriculture is actually_ rain-fed agriculture is possible.
But, then... When, when the stubble_ when the field tha_ gets harvested, and there's stubble left there.
That is actually a valuable grazing resource for the animals.
So the animal herds will tend to move south, after the, um, the millet has been harvested.
And they'll stay around the re_ the villages in the, in the dry season.
Grazing on the stubble in the fields.
And sometimes farmers will actually encourage people.
The, the, um, the nomadic groups, to settle on their land, and corral their animals there.
Because that then, builds, up the manure available for them to use in their fields.
Now over the years, the terms of, of the relationship_ which is some ways, in the past was seen as compliment- c- complementary.
The exchange between the, the, um, livestock producers and the, and the farmers.
That has changed the nature of the balance.
Um, so_ and in terms, terms of power, the agricultural population are more powerful.
And th_ and their development, has perhaps been better.
The, um, the livestock sector, which is arguably perhaps where, these dry regions have their economic advantage, has been neglected somewhat.
Or subject to management which, has been imported from other areas.
Particularly f_ the western model of range_ um, of range management from_ particularly from the States.
The idea of fixing, um, grazing areas, and delimiting it.
And saying, 'okay, animals can graze here for this number of days.
And then move to this paddock, and so on.
' Such a model does not work in, in the, dry regions.
But it has been tried, and, the results have often been disastrous.
Um, rapid, um, changes in animal numbers.
And, a lot of deaths to_ of animals, um, during, during the famine years.
Have altered, altered the_ their, their ability to, to recon- reconstitute the herds after the droughts.
And they've often come back, to, the activity on different terMs  um, sometimes they've been_ they've come back and they're now looking after the animals of the agricultural population.
But the relationship between the two ha- has changed.
And access to resources.
The watering ho_ the water holes, which they, traditionally relied on, to water their holes, are now seen, in many areas, as attractive agricultural resources.
So, the agricultural population will, take control of these areas, and plant round them.
And when the herds come to water there, they cause inevitable crop damage.
And there's disputes.
And, sometimes these are of a very violent nature.
But, there's always_ probably always been conflict between, the relationships between the two groups.
But, whether this is heightened now, by greater, greater media coverage is not, is not clear.
But certainly the relationship has changed, and the_ certainly the access to resources, and, how people_ how_ the freedom to move around, uh, which is an essential one, for success in livestock production.
That is an, an_ clearly one that has changed.
To conclude about, livestock production in dry land Africa.
An essential point to realise, is that, livestock production, is, an efficient way of dealing with the, uh, temporal and spatial variab_ rainfall variability.
And that, accepting this mobility is the key to, to, furthering what is, perhaps, many of these regions, their, only future, in terms of, exports.
And that_ but, that, to understand mobility requires very different logics, um, to, the very sedentary kind of thinking that dominates a lot of, um, western thought, and which, unfortunately, has been transposed, onto, development planning in dry land Africa."
"Well what i am talking_ what i'm going to talk about now is quite difficult to talk about it, because, um, i'm, in a phase_ well like most teenagers and young adults.
Uh, um, where you_ when you think a lot about life.
About people, about who you are and, you're looking for your identity.
And, i think i'm really English now.
And sometimes it's quite hard because, yeah, you're looking for truth.
You're looking, for self-knowledge.
It's all, an app- (xx) about yourself and other people.
And personally i want to be, as assertive, as i can.
And it's quite difficult.
But, why people who can would sometimes_ they just seem to be.
And, in actual fact they- they are not so assertive.
It's just a_ a cover.
And inside they are very_ quite conscious and not very, yeah.
Not, not confident.
And it's also that intuition.
So, for this, um, i think i'm quite lucky to be, maybe more intuitive than, than most people.
I don't know actually, but_ um, it's a bit as if i had just star_ started to know other people.
And comparing myself with others.
So, i might say it's now, but maybe later, you know, i'll change my mind.
But actual_ actually now, i'm looking for somebody more like me.
More intuitive.
And i think it's quite hard.
Because, although we are_ we_ i mean when, when i say we, it's all, young people you know.
Maybe, ah- maybe older people are at forty they are also looking for their identity.
I am sure so.
But i mean, if you start looking for, for yourself, it's- ah- in your late teens.
And, yes, as i was saying it is really difficult to find somebody beca_ somebody like me are looking_ well, we are all looking for, uh, our identity.
To know ourselves better.
But, we don't, show it really.
Maybe, maybe, i do.
Depends with whom of course.
But, most people i think are, just, is_ is trying to escape it or... Um, or showing that they are adul_ adult when they are not at all.
I mean you can be adult when you are... Well, whenever of course.
But, um, most people are not adult before a long time, i think.
Before they're fifty, even- even sometimes.
And, i mean it is not bad.
And there's nothing ba_ against that.
It's absolutely normal.
I would even like people to- to acknowledge it.
And, that mi_ might make it easier, for people to, get to know themselves better.
Because if they go on escaping themselves.
They want help really, to discover who they really are.
And... So, i'm hoping to, to find somebody or, my aunt is a bit like that.
Uh, so she's fifty, and a bit and a few years.
Uh, fifty, fifty-ish.
If you know that.
And, we go on together quite well.
And, i mean, she- she's a real friend for me.
Although sometimes, she might, behave like a mother to me.
But, now i think she's understood, and we are more like friends.
But i would like somebody of my age.
To- to be like that with me.
And, (xx xx) change it with me.
Um, it's quite difficult, i think."
"Lutheranism and Calvinism, in sixteenth, early seventeenth century Europe.
It is usually_ it is usual to see the Lutheran, uh, movement as dominant, in the Reformation, down to fifteen fifty, against, a degenerate medieval church.
Which was not putting up much resistance.
Which is almost crumbling before it like rotten wood.
Then from fifteen fifty, to sixteen sixty, or sixteen hundred, I should say.
Calvinism, takes over as the dominant Protestant wave.
As a mirror image, to find a regenerate, and reviving, Roman Catholic Church.
A Roman Catholic Church, starting to be regenerated by the reforms of the Council of Trent, and the whole, movement we call the Counter-Reformation.
Now, Lutheranism and Calvinism then, a- differ from each other.
And the difference, does a, as I have just hinted, a lot, to the different circumstances, in which, they find themselves.
Um, that tells us a lot about the character of the two, Protestant waves.
Um, with Luther, one, pivotal, aspect, of Lutheranism's engagement with life of earth.
The earthly world if you like.
The unregenerate world, of politics, etcetera, is his downgrading of the visible Church.
Luther, in reaction to the great claims of the Roman Catholics, said the visible Church, the Church as an institution.
The Church is, if you like, equivalent to a princely government, or, as we might say today, to I-C-I, um, or Honda or something, is not essential to salvation.
Uh, what is essential is a direct personal relationship with God, or Christ.
Um... But only slightly indirectly, this means much more power and wealth for the German princes.
Because Luther also says as, you have to have he conceded reluctantly some sort of visible organised Church, but is just a worldly institution.
An earthly institution, rather like a chancellory.
Or you might say today, rather like, the Department of Health.
Um, and the people to run things on Earth are the princes.
But, in practice, that means that power and wealth go to the princes.
The princes take over the monasteries.
The monastic wealth.
They take over the way the visible Church is governed.
And, ten years later, the English king, Henry VIII, imitates German princes, like the Elector of Saxony in this.
Even though he's not a Lutheran.
Um, now... The prince's support was, vital, in any case, for Luther.
Without the support of the Elector Frederick of Saxony in the early days, um, Luther would not have survived personally.
So, the princes and Luther, um, prop each other up.
And that's the way the Lutheran movement spreads.
But as it gets mixed with worldly streams it becomes a far cry from the original, um, profound thoughts on, salvation.
The other-worldly aspect of Lutheranism.
Um, but this theory of princely absolutism.
It is said with some justice, that Luther, delivered, men's souls from the tyranny of the Pope to hand them over to the tyranny of the princes.
This theory of princely absolutism, did not go down so well outside the Germanic lands.
There was almost as_ an assumption the Lutheran political thought, that the prince would approve, of, the new religion.
Or, if he didn't, you shouldn't resist him.
The problem is, that when you get outside Germany and Scandinavia.
Scandinavia being very influenced by, um, Germany.
Um, when you get to France, the Hapsburg lands, like the Netherlands, Sco_ and Spain.
Scotland, Mary in England, um, this doesn't work.
The local monarch, does not, approve of, and indeed vigourously opposes Lutheranism.
The circumstances of fifteen twenties, fifteen thirties Germany don't apply.
Um, as a result, from fifteen fifty-five after the Peace of Augsberg, Lutheranism stagnates.
Um, it doesn't really know where to go.
And in fact, Lutherans start a quarrel ideologically among themselves in Germany.
Now, Calvinism fills this void.
It's far more aggressive, and if it has to choose between the faith, and the monarch.
It's no respecter, of established monarchies.
As Mary Queen of Scots found out, fatally.
Philip of Spain found out to his inconvenience, the Dutch Calvinists throw off their allegiance to him, and various French monarchs, of the late, sixteenth century, the last of the Valoir, have to fight the Calvinist Rebels.
The French Calvinists, by the way, are called Huguenot.
You probably want to know why they are called Huguenot.
You tell me if you can, no one really knows.
Ha ha.
There are various ingenious explanations but French Calvinists are called Huguenot.
Um, back to the main stream.
Calvinism has a highly organised visible church.
Equivalent to the Roman Catholic Church.
But of course different.
They're organised in different directions.
For example, where the Roman Catholics say you have to have beauty of holiness images, crucifixes.
Calvinism says that's sinful and idolatrous.
Where the Roman Catholics say you have to have apostolic bishops, they're the successors of St.
Peter and the Apostles.
Calvinists tend to say, no, you should have a slightly more democratic, Presbyterian form of Government.
But they have definite views.
While with Luther, it didn't matter.
You could have bishops or not have bishops.
You could have images, or not have images.
He called those adiaphora in Greek.
That is 'things indifferent'.
Queen Elizabeth, followed Luther there, Queen Elizabeth of England.
But... The Calvinists, then, because of Calvin's immense stress on earthly organisation were able to fight fire with fire.
Um, I must emphasise that Calvinists were not revolutionaries.
They didn't have to be.
In Bohemia for example, the Catholic Hapsburg ruler had to tolerate them.
In Elizabethan England, the local versions of the Calvinists, the Puritans, um, although the queen found them a bit of a nuisance, they were within an establishment.
They were a ginger group within her church, and they had powerful friends at Court.
Leicester, who immediately became Elizabeth's boyfriend, Bedford, um, Warwick, Leicester's brother Sir Francis Walsingham etcetera.
The English_ the Elizabethan period was not revolutionary, although they were a bit radical.
In the Palatine, um, the German elector of the Palatine changes from Lutherism to Calvinism in fifteen seventy-nine, and institutes Calvinism from the top.
But they would be revolutionary if they had to be.
Now Calvin's clarity of writing, and his internationalism, helps to spread Calvinism around.
As theologians go, Calvin is not too difficult to understand.
His body of, teachings is still fell_ is fairly coherent as early as fifteen thirty-six, his institutes, when he was a young man.
He expands it for the next thirty years of his life, but doesn't essentially change it.
While, Luther, the spread of Lutheranism suffers from Luther's later German-ness.
Luther's later writings get mixed up with the political situation in Germany, and, um, Luther_ Luther's writings are often somewhat obscure, referring to contemporary German political events and personalities of the fifteen twenties.
Which if you are, say, an Italian in the fifteen nineties, you would find very difficult to understand.
Um, uh, Luther is even xenophobic, hating foreigners, particularly Spanish and Italians at times.
Which, of course, if you're a Spanish or Italian will put you off converting.
But Calvin doesn't have that.
He's clear in thought and more systematic.
In a way he's standing on Luther's shoulders of course.
But of course, all this depends on taste.
Some people prefer a conservative continuity, a moderate reform.
In which case go for Lutheranism.
Queen Elizabeth of England certainly thought that.
She hated, Calvinism.
Especially the Scotsman John Knox, who really got up her nose.
It's often overlooked, that in say, sixteen forty-eight, there were more Lutherans than Calvinists in Europe.
Because although Luther had stagnated_ Lutheranism had stagnated it had most of Germany, and it had Scandanavia.
Um, while official Calvinist states, were few, small even tiny.
Scotland the United Provinces, and Geneva itself, bits of Switzerland.
Um, Calvinism had a reputation as being stark, and often violent.
Um, let's examine a few cliches.
One cliche is, Calvinism is a_ was a religion of the urban middle class.
This is an over-simplification.
Um, in fact, as the counter_ Catholic Counter Reformation advanced.
It often took over the towns, say, in France.
And Calvinism in the seventeenth century hangs on better, in the less-peaceable countryside.
While Eastern Europe where there were quite a lot of Calvinists, who flourished because of the weak, um, central government, and frantic confusion.
Scotland_ were under-urbanised even by seventeenth century standards.
Rather I would say the Calvinists appealed to certain members of a broad middle band of society.
From what might be called the upper peasantry or working class.
Through anything that can be called a working_ a middle class, into the lower upper class.
People who'd got somewhere in life, but wanted to get further: aspirance.
It didn't necessarily appeal to the people at the top.
Um, because, they didn't have to aspire.
And, they could enjoy, you know, courtiers, and kings could enjoy a rather luxurious life.
Um, it could be, sexuality, or it could be, cultivated taste in fine arts.
Like Charles I, who was a Cal_ of England, who was a Calvinist nightmare.
Who patronised, although not a C- Roman Catholic, patronised Catholic artists, and sculptors.
And as for the poor, um, Calvinism pre_ precume_ presumes literacy, and, it also presumes a ra_ because you have to do, Bible study.
It also presumes, a rather strict lifestyle.
But if you were a poor subsistence peasant, booze and sex were almost your only outlets, in those days.
Look at the pictures of Bruegel.
So you don't want the few opportunities for pleasure that you do have, being stamped on, saying, 'no you've got to be severe all the time.
' Why should you be.
Um, so Calvinism doesn't necessarily appeal to the poor.
Although many fel- peasants in Scotland and southern France, are forcibly Calvanised and I'll say do stick to it, once they've got there.
And, uh ... Um... The radical and revolutionary supporters, the lower-class supporters of Calvinism are useful in the early revolutionary phase.
But then the Calvinists tend to control them and the middle and upper classes take over.
What about Protestantism as being the ideology of capitalism.
Well, that's is another gross over-simplification.
Capitalism took centuries to evolve.
Lutheran Calvin's contribution is markedly indirect.
And, they disapproved of the great financiers and moneylenders like the Fuggers or the Welsers of their own day."
"I think one of the... Definitely most interesting books_ I think it's very intriguing is a book called, uh, Sphere by Michael Crichton.
Uh, it's about_ it's basically_ it's very_ it's like intellectually advanced.
It has a lot of scientific theory, in it.
It's like_ it's_ but it's inherent into the story.
So you don't need to understand it, to really understand the book.
And it's about these scientists in present day, like nineteen ninety-eight or something like that.
And they discover this humongous space ship beneath the sea, in the pacific ocean.
And_ but what puzzles them, the most about the space ship is that... It, it's must have crashed into the ocean.
But it's completely intact.
There's not a scratch on the plane at all, the entire space ship.
Plus its dimension, it's about half a mile long, which is just, enormous.
It's ri- it's it's huge.
So they bring out this team, of scientists, because, they figure scientists will_ because they figure it's going to be an alien life form.
And they figure they'll definitely need the brains of the people as opposed to like sending military people onto it, to, you know, understand and figure out what is going on.
So they send this team down.
And they are_ they can judge by the sea life around it, that it's been there for three hundred years.
It's been there for three hundred years.
And so this is, completely puzzling to them.
And they open it up, and they go inside and it turns out that it's an American space craft.
That's been there for three hundred years.
First of all America hasn't even been around for three hundred years.
So this is very puzzling to the scientists, and they're trying to figure out what's going on.
And, basically through the flight recorder that they find on the aeroplane, on the spaceship, sorry.
They found out that it's a spacecraft, that's flown through a black hole.
Now scientifically it's theoretically possible if you fly into a black hole, the space-time continuum around it, kind of tears apart, and it's possible to time travel back in the past.
Through something called, uh, wormholes.
It doesn't matter_ it isn't significant to the story_ that's the whole idea.
So basically it was a spaceship that was sent into the future_ that was sent in_ was sent from the future, fifty years from the now.
So it'll be like two thousand and forty eight.
Sent into the future through a back hole, and it ended up three hundred years in the past, crashed into the ocean.
No actually, it, it appeared under the ocean.
That's how it_ it just appeared there.
That's why there is no damage to it.
And... So this team of scientists is living in, uh, a habitat beneath the ocean.
And so they're, ""okay we've discovered all of this, this_ we should get out here because some of the people on the team're getting a little scared, a little disconcerted that they shouldn't be down here anyway.""   like, ""okay we've done our job, there's no alien life-form here, let's get out of here."" unfortunately, there's a, a horrible tro-... Uh, I think it's a tropical storm above them on the surface.
So they can't be pulled out of there for, six days.
So while they're down there they discover another object.
It's a thirty foot diameter sphere, perfect in every way.
It's completely smooth and everything.
But there's a door, but they they can't figure out how to open it.
So one of the_ so they, they try and try, and they give up.
But then one of_ the mathematical genius of the group, opens it up, somehow, they don't know how.
He opens it up, and he goes inside, and when they find him he has_ he had already come out of it.
He's very disorientated.
But when he comes out of it_ as soon as he comes out of it, everything starts to go haywire.
Weird things start to happen, huge squids start appearing out of nowhere.
Uh, all of sudden there's no life around there, but now there's tons of fauna and there's fish and, everything is going on.
And basically from that point on, it's about figuring out what's going on.
And they know this sphere is connected.
And then there's_ the three main characters of the book, the ones that aren't killed off by the monsters that start appearing, actually.
They start talking to an alien through a computer.
This alien who says his name is Jerry.
Which is kind of strange for a name, for an alien.
But they like it anyway.
And... So,it's_ it really comes down to being a battle of wills and intellect, within the three characters.
Because eventually all three characters go inside this sphere.
And so, they are all on an even keel in some way.
And it turns out, through the power of the sphere, that once you've been inside it, the power of your thoughts come true.
As in like, if you had a nightmare about... A big squid coming to eat you.
Then a big squid will appear and it starts attacking the habitat.
And so the habitat gets_ that's exactly what happens in the story.
And everything's getting damaged, they, and they are still like four days away from being rescued.
And they don't_ they haven't figured out in the story, yet, that they are causing it.
And even when they do figure it out.
And it's, it's very interesting, because it's about the characters, trying to figure out who they can trust, and can they even trust themselves.
And what are they are going to do to just like to survive.
And in the end, they, uh, they come across the idea that they just_ this is like completely beyond them.
That this sphere_ they_ so, they try to figure out the purpose of why this sphere would be there.
And they say, ""well this is just, this is beyond, what we should have done with it.
We should never have even ever like opened it up at all.
Cuz it's just not, good.
And we are not doing very well with it and we are killing ourselves here.
So in the end they used their power to forget the power that they had.
Which is a kind of a paradox.
But... It's a book and it worked.
And, uh, in the end the three characters ended up, the only survivors of about a twelve man team that went down there.
And since they've forgot the power,they forgot everything that happened.
And, in the end, you almost feel sorry for the characters, just cuz they don't have, any memory of what happened.
And as far as they know they just appeared there, with no no recent memory of the past events.
And it leaves_ it's a kind of eerie ending.
But definitely, definitely a book worth reading."
"The first country in the world to industrialize was England.
And, um... E- England, uh, pursued a, a, a model of industrialization that was very much, uh, hands off and laissez faire.
[French term] um, but, i- in social science, um... As a late comer, um, the rules_ you find that the rules are changed_ uh, the rules of the game and so, um, the same, the same model that,that the United Kingdom pursued, uh, f- uh, for_ to industrialize itself, um, couldn't necessarily be replicated, uh, in other parts of the world.
And so... We find that there is, uh, another wave of industrializers [industrialization].
Germany, France, and, um, the United States which industrialized towards_ in the, um, last, uh, third of the nineteenth century.
And, and then, um... We come to Japan.
Um, Japan is,began its industrialization, uh, sometime at the end of the nineteenth century.
But pretty much industrialized in the twentieth century.
And, right now as we stand, um, those countries are all part of the, the first world.
Um, they, they made it so to speak, you know, to the league of industrialized countries.
Um, it's only, after the, um, the second world war that we, we, have_ we speak of the first and the second and the third worlds.
And the reason for that is, um, that industrialization, um, has become a very hard thing to do for countries.
Uh, especially in the second half of the twentieth century for countries, uh, in the third world.
Because of a number of things, colonization, imperialism, um, the cold war.
And so for, for, for a poor agrarian society to industrialize, uh, and, and catch up to the, the first world um,has become an extremely difficult thing to, to accomplish.
Nevertheless, um_ and in the third world, you know, we have to include Latin America, Africa, uh, and Asia_ and parts of Asia.
And maybe nowadays after the end of the cold war, you know, some countries of the, of the old, uh, old communist bloc_um, nevertheless, um, some countries in East Asia have been remarkably successful (sniff) at industrialization in extremely adverse, circumstances in the last, uh, five decades.
Um, the record is more mixed, uh, um, elsewhere from, um, from a very poor and almost nonexistent uh,track of, you know, economic development and industrialization in Africa.
To a somewhat mixed one in Latin America with, you know, some setbacks and, some advances.
Um, but n- North East Asia in particular Korea and Taiwan, uh, have become examples of, of um, um ex-_ of poor agrarian societies that, have almost made it to the league of industrialized countries.
Um, and, eh, the way they went about this, um, is, is somewhat similar to the way Japan industrialized.
But the circumstances were so different that, uh, they, they initiated at a_ um, an industrialization, or a political economic paradigm or_ all of there own, essentially.
Um, and their, their success, uh, has been, uh, imitated elsewhere, but not with the same effects.
And I think it is because, uh, um,th- the circumstances under which they did this were very unique, and were very particular to their situation.
It is no accident then that both Korea and Taiwan are divided, societies very much at the center of, of the cold war.
Um, um it is no accident that both, uh, have had very similar historical trajectories.
Both were, uh, Japanese colonies, uh, for about the same period of time.
Um,it is no accident also that, uh, uh, their populations are a very, very much homogeneous.
Taiwan has a, um, a minority of, of, um, mainlanders from China.
But other than that, um, you know, the native Taiwanese population which makes up the majority is, uh, essentially very homogeneous.
Um... And, um, their, their, their historical cycles are extremely, uh, um, the- their correlation is, is, is, is amazing, you know, to say the least.
Um, and, um, well like, uh, as I said before, um, Taiwan and, and South Korea, um, had a start at industrialization during the, the Japanese occupation.
And they, they, they, um, copied many of the methods that Japan used, for its own industrialization.
Um.
And what I'm speaking here of is, uh,essentially a state that is very, very intrusive down to, to the last, um, um, you know, and down to the last, um, cranny of society,um, a state that, atte- that, that is very much engaged in the social engineering or social architecture, um, if y- if, you know, that's_ if there is such a phrase, um, if such a phrase exists.
Um, um, so this is a, this is a state that... Is not only very, uh, powerful but also very capable.
Uh, at undertaking uh, actions to a structure, uh, society in general ways, but also in very specific ways.
Um, and, uh, it is, it is it's something very hard to replicate in other countries.
Because, um, there is_ there are specific historical circumstances which provided for this.
Which are absent or impossible to replicate in, other parts of the third world."
"In ninety-ninety-two, one of the largest campaign issues in the, uh, United States of America's presidential campaign, was the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Touted by, the right wing and mainly corporate interests, as essentially being a great boon or a great possibility for the expansion of American jobs.
The fundamental issues with regard to the Free Trade Agreement were these.
American corporations would, for all intents and purposes be allowed to move, their plant and capital, and largely, to export labor, um, overseas.
And particularly over free trade zo- free trade zone between the Can- Canada, the United States and Mexico.
The results, were, as many, uh, pundits both within the middle of the road in terms, iof politics and those, especially of the Left Wing, was very simply explained.
Corporations wanted an environment where they could have low wages, low regulation, in terms of, corporate liability, in terms of their ability to pay taxes to governments and also, um, environmental regulations.
What has happened since the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement over the, over the outcries of the American people.
And over the outcries of the vast majority, um, of, of commentators.
Who are particularly interested in the economic aspects both from the right wing and the left wing, has been as many had predicted.
Despite the attempts at obfuscation or the attempts at muddying the waters, done largely by the American press.
Very simply this, manufacturing jobs that had largely employed the lower middle classes in the United States have moved south of the border to, regions within Guadalajara, and Northern Mexico referred to as maquiladoras.
maquiladoras are free, ent- enterprise zones established by the Mexican government that allow, American business to operate freely, without worry of, native environmental protections, um, that allow them to establish a wages as low as they would like.
Essentially to create a large_ a labor_ a very fluid labor market, which of course prevents unionization which also, um, prevents companies_ and the largely American companies from having to pay, um, benefits and also observe worker, uh, occupational health and safety regulations and not worry about workers' rights.
Uh, the result has largely been a massive loss of jobs, um, some estimates, uh, some estimate given by the U-S Department of Labor as high as into the tens of millions of jobs that have been lost, um, to export of jobs.
Uh, usually largely semiskilled and unskilled labor positions, um, down into Mexico.
Um, the savings, uh, given to these American corporations have resulted in, um, massive promotions and also massive, uh, wage increases on the part of those members of American corporate, community in the executive suite.
We've watched C-E-O salaries and salaries of those that sit in the executive suite in American companies, uh, fly through the roof.
While the amount of_ the average amount of discretionary income, within the United States has actually fallen.
Uh, the first fall, um, I do believe since the end of the Second World War.
Instead, instead of paying the American minimal wage of about five dollars to five dollars and twenty five cents an hour.
These companies have been able to pay Mexican workers on average about seventy cents a day, to do the equivalent job.
Such massive cuts in the pr_ uh, price of labor have allowed them to meet, uh, their profit targets, um, largely in industries that involved light manufacturing like clothing, uh, textiles, um, shoes, um, in largely lower technology manufacturing positions.
Um, to some extent, um, the Americans have also been able to export light manufacturing, such as the manufacturing of auto parts.
Uh,these have been successful on two fronts.
First they have been successful in breaking, um, the strength of trade unions within the United States.
And therefore in so doing in destroying unionization within the United States pushing, um, left politics or largely new left politics further to the margins, as they watch their largely, uh, labor, uh, foundations being withered away by these, these attempts by American corporations to, uh, export them or marginalize them.
Um, they have also destroyed a lot of the efforts on the_ on the parts of Greens within the United States to, really go after corporations who violate, uh, environmental production regulations.
Those, um, companies that find i- it too onerous to abide by basic, uh, laws governing what can and cannot be polluted.
Um, simply pick up shop, and move across the border, uh, to Mexico wherein there are no emissions, um, or dumping regulations with regard to toxic chemicals and pollution of water and pollution of air.
None of these are a concern of the Mexican government, um, as long as they play their part in the NAFTA regulations.
Which is to provide a very large and very fluid, um, and unorganized, um, unskilled and semiskilled labor force.
Um, a lot of opposition to NAFTA has only, has risen only lately as more and more mainstream Americans,or shall we say middle income white Americans, who are the large percentage of the, voting population in the United States have realized that there are negative externalities or shall we say, um, negative aspects of the economy, that are directly related to the market that build up when you actually export jobs.
As you lose your whole market, um, to to ov__ to_ by sending your jobs overseas you lose your home market.
That means people have less money to spend on the goods that are produced.
Because your average Mexican who is making seventy cents on, on the day, or manufacturing your sneaker cannot afford that sneaker.
Whereas the American, who is making five dollars and twenty five cents an hour making that sneaker can.
Um, the drying up of the home market has pushed, more and more American corporations and NAFTA is probably the largest influence, have pushed more and more corporations to try and do_ finance their profits, through financial speculation.
Therefore we have seen the actual bloating of the American stock market.
The over capitalization of the American stock market.
And the overvaluation of stocks.
These are an attempt, um, by corporations of instead of remedying the problem, of dropping discretionary income and dropping wages in the United States.
By trying to make money through the stock market through the means of gambling what little assets they do have, raising, the values of their stock ridiculously high when they have no assets to back those stocks.
And putting the entire American economy in danger.
In the end attempts at short-term profit motive in the attempt to break, uh, labor in the United States, have engineered the very, very beginnings of a very traumatic financial crisis, in the United States all in the name of short-term gain."
"On the eve of the Reformation, religious life in England, fourteen fifty, fifteen thirty.
England was still, of course, a Catholic country.
In, a way, i, don't like to use the word Roman Catholic, because that, belongs, I think, to the post-Reformation period.
The Roman Catholic Church versus the Protestants i_ belongs to a hundred years later.
I prefer to say it was part of the Universal Latin Church of Western Europe, of the middle ages.
The first thing to notice about this church, as, in England, as elsewhere, was its great wealth, and power.
Not peculiar to England, but we are focusing on England.
Far wealthier and more powerful than the churches today.
It also had a monopoly.
You couldn't pick and choose your churches, officially.
Um, and, a far higher proportion, of the population than today, were professionally connected with it.
In fact, the church, forms an alternative, or complementary, stratified society to lay society.
The higher clergy, were the equivalent of the nobles and gentry.
Say, the two archbishops equivalent of dukes, bishops equivalent of barons, cannons and deans equivalent of gentry, and so on.
Um, the main thing to notice about the higher clergy, is they spent, most of their time, most of them, not doing clerical things at all.
But being civil servants and ministers to the king.
A good example of that in the fourteenth century, a bit earlier, is, William of Wyecombe.
Who was Edward III's lord chancellor, and founded New College.
Then his imitator, in exactly our period, William of Waynflete, his namesake.
They were both Bishop of Winchester, who founded Magdalen College [pronounced 'Maudlin'] whose tower you can still see, um, as you enter Oxford.
Very beautiful tower.
Um, that tower was organised, the finance for it was organised by a young fellow Magdalenian, called Thomas Wolsey in the fourteen nineties.
And he was the last of these great cardinal ministers.
He was then just the bursar, of Magdalen, a less_ to be a don in those days was not as good as it is today.
But then he went to London, and ended up as King Henry VIII's chief minister, by the fifteen tens.
That's another story.
But, I've said enough, realise that a lot of the bishops, were really maybe honest, and hard-working men, but really civil servants, who were in orders, and were, rewarded by being given a bishopry.
But, they left the actual work_ most of them, not all, left the actual work of being diocesan bishops, to their vicar generals.
So there wasn't full leadership at the top.
When you get to the parish clergy.
And remember England was an overwhelmingly rural country.
You get a big jump.
Or a big drop.
They were humble.
Socially and educationally, not, um, much above the peasants, whom they served.
And they were usually of peasant origin.
They hadn't been to university like the high clergy, but had learnt a bit of Latin, and a little scripture, on the spot, from another priest.
Just as a craftsman wou_ who made saddles, or other leather goods, would be apprenticed to a master.
Um, however, the parish clergy were quite prosperous.
Even educated, by the standards of the peasantry themselves.
And if they were moral men they were probably better as, um, pastoral, workers and priests, than a highly-educated, university-trained cleric would be.
Um, the really poor, were those without livings at all, who had to go around working for other priests, saying mass, you know, um, for money, fro_ uh, now and again.
That sort of thing.
There were also a large number of hangers on, often disreputable in the church.
Whom Chaucer, the fith_ fourteen century poet satirises, were in minor orders, not priests at all.
Sextons, and vergers, doorkeepers, the summoners, to the archdeacon's court.
The fact that I mention the archdeacon's court, shows the power of the church.
If you blasphemed, or did immoral things like, um, sex before marriage, in those days.
And, if you fathered, or had an illegitimate child, depending on your gender, you'd be up  before the archdeacon.
And, certainly for heresy.
But just for ordinary crime_ or ordinary, um, imm- immorality, or dissolute lifestyle, and he'd fine you, or even imprison you.
Um, then, of course, we come to the regular clergy.
The monks, and nuns.
They were rich, at this time.
Their monasteries had usually been there, by now for five hundred years, maybe longer.
Since Anglo Saxon times.
They'd collected a lot of land, and, buildings, and money.
And they'd usually neglected, their simple austere rule.
Which said that they should, work, and, have a rather uncomfortable time, physically, but pray.
Chaucer, takes this off in the thirteen eighties, with his monk who's really a prior, who, is really a country gentleman, who happens to be a monk.
Not a bad man, but not our idea of a monk.
The prior likes, um, hunting, stuffing himself with goose, wearing fine clothes, etcetera.
Um, so, the monks and nuns of this time are usually not fervent.
Um, in contrast to what Henry VIII said, however, or had his lackeys to say in the fifteen thirties, they were not usually debauched either.
Henry VIII, um, has a very spicy view of them painted, in order to, dissolve the monasteries.
But, they'd lost much of their raison d'etre, to use a French phrase.
What were they for anymore, around fifteen hundred.
In this framework, the laity, pursued their devotional life.
Let me say it seems conventional enough.
There's little evidence of heresy, uh, and, or even of anticlericalism.
Heresy that's non-Catholic beliefs.
Which seems odd when the Reformation is just about th- 'round the corner.
But we'll deal with that another time.
Anti_ anticlericalism is simple general criticism of the shortcomings of the clergy.
And, we know it existed.
But if you look at wills and other documents left by the elite, you don't see it in those.
Anticlericalism, by the way is not heresy.
You can be a perfectly good Catholic and still anticlerical.
Um, the rich laity endowed religious institutions, especially the parish churches.
They weren't so fond of the monasteries.
And this was linked to commemorative masses.
They wanted priests to pay for their souls.
Intercessory prayers, with God.
This was very sensible really, according to the Catholic teaching.
People believed that after their death they'd spend an awful lot of time in purgatory, and that they might get, very brutally punished there, by God, for their sins.
Um, a very hard-headed man thought that.
The first Tudor, Henry VIII, who left the equivalent of about a million pounds in our currency to pay for ten thousand, masses for his soul.
Because he knew that he done a lot of, morally disreputable things as a_ as a king in order to get and keep his throne.
And although he seems a very hard-headed earthly figure, he was obviously very frightened on his death bed.
And tried to buy his way into heaven.
Typical Henry, he takes out his cheque book or_ they didn't quite have cheque books, but if he had had one, that's what he'd have done.
Uh hum.
So, um, the church benefited a great deal from this belief in purgatory.
Which caused people to endow, um, uh, the, the clergy and churches on a huge scale.
The process is a worldly element.
If you, give money to your parish church, of course you're perpetuating your glory, after your death and the glory of your family.
But nevertheless a belief in purgatory, must have real, otherwise why not raise monuments to your glory in a more secular way.
Um, many laity, especially poor ones who couldn't pay for prayers on their own, joined confraternities.
Sort of religious organisations.
Often connected with trade guilds.
Um, um, these confraternities would themselves pay for, um, prayers, and requiem masses, and intercessory masses, after your death.
The role of towns, was very important, in religious life at this time.
As I said in the country, the parish clergy, tended to be, not particularly well-educated.
Rather peasant like themselves.
So, wealthier and more educated people, could find, a much more cultivated clergy, in their_ in the towns.
The religious practice of the elite, as you might expect, was more educated, more bookish.
Books of devotion, especially after printing came in in the fourteen seventies, were produced in English, in rather large numbers.
Indeed a Venetian observer, talks about the English in London all poring over their books of devotion.
But there wee limits to this, the, um, elite shared a lot of superstitions, collecting relics with the ordinary peasantry.
They went on pilgrimage as well.
And the core belief was of course_ remained the same.
We might just glance at various movements around fifteen hundred.
There's the humanist movement, associated with the Dutchman Erasmus.
And in England with his friend Thomas Moore, Bishop Fisher, both of whom died as martyrs for the Roman Church in_ under Henry VIII.
They wanted, uh, they d- they wanted, a deeper and more profound, understanding of Catholic teaching, and they wanted to clean up church abuses.
They also, wanted people to read the New Testament.
Whether in New Testament Greek, which was now being studied again, or in a good translation.
They were not Protestants or heretics.
But they were overtaken by the Protestant movement.
Then there was anticlericalism.
The humanists were often anticlerical.
But anticlericalism as such, was, a general thing.
It's a game, all of the family can play.
If you have ever_ you don't need much more equipment than a mouth.
You can be intellectual, sophisticated, or you can just be generally critical.
If you've ever seen the film made of Thomas Moore in the sixties, A Man for All Seasons.
In_ at the opening when Wolsey sends a messenger to Moore's house.
Moore is holding a party, and there's some guy leaning against the mantelpiece, who's a bit drunk.
And he says, 'ha, ha, ha, they say half the bastards in England are fathered by a priest.
' That is just the sort of anticlerical remark, you can make very easily.
But there was a lot of criticism of this sort.
It didn't mean that people were not good Catholics.
But they disliked the shortcomings of the church.
It's wealth and pride of the clergy.
There was the native English heresy of Lollardy, which dated from the fourteenth century, which anticipated some of Protestantism.
But, Lollardy was confined to, the poor by now.
The elite's adherence had been, discouraged in the early fifteenth century.
And mainly wandering poor, craftsman, peddlers, etcetera, evangelised certain areas, London.
There were Lollers in London, Lon_ Lollers in the Chiltons in East Anglia.
The average, sort of fixed subsistence peasant, ploughing arable land with his oxen, was not usually a Lollard.
But Lollardy existed, and came to be absorbed into the Protestant bloodstream, later in the sixteenth century.
Then from the fifteen twenties Lutheranism, creeps in.
Lutheranism, is not, a suppressed native heresy.
It's not even a set of debating points in Latin.
By the end of the fifteen twenties it's an organised rival church in Germany.
And it interests various sorts of, um, English people, including sailors.
We don't usually associate sailors going to Germany, to Hamburg, with being particularly religious, today.
But, apparently they were then.
Merchants trade into Germany, and there were German merchants in England.
The Hanseatic merchants.
Um, intellectuals in Cambridge, the young Thomas Cranmer, and, the undergraduate who was to be Elizabeth's first archbishop, Matthew Parker, 'Nosy Parker', were all just discussing Lutherism.
Nevertheless, its influence belongs to after fifteen thirty, even after fifteen forty-seven.
It interested people, but it hadn't really reached, um, the masses, by fifteen thirty.
You need the opening of the break with Rome, before Protestantism really seeps in.
So, a fairly conventional late medieval Catholicism with grumbles then.
How England, by fifteen ninety transforms into an overwhelmingly Protestant country, is quite puzzling, but is another story."
"Protestantism in England, fifteen sixty, sixteen forty.
The Church of England and its critics.
Finally, an officially established, after around thirty years of vicissitudes in fifteen fifty-nine, by Queen Elizabeth.
The Church of England lasted, in the phase, until its contemporary collapse in the sixteen forties, in the days of the Civil War, and Charles I.
So let us look at some definitions, religious definitions in this period.
One.
'Papist' or 'recusant'.
These are, slightly abusive, or one might say, rather abusive, Elizabethan terms, for Roman Catholics.
A Roman Catholic, all contemporaries were clear what a Roman Catholic was.
He was a Catholic loyal to the international, um, spiritual monarchy of the Pope, just as today.
And, they, are not the subject of this talk.
Two.
'Arminian Laudian'.
Or, a more modern term might be 'Anglo-Catholic' or 'High Churchman'.
Um, this, um, sect, rose to prominence, and indeed, briefly to dominance within the Church of England, in the sixteen twenties and thirties.
Their modern descendants are Anglo-Catholics.
Um, they, were, largely a priestly party, who wanted to emphasise the Catholic remnants in the Church of England, and re-Catholicise the Church of England, in, theology largely, ritual, beauty of holiness, that is internal Church declaration etcetera.
But it was Catholicism without the Pope.
They certainly, did not want to go back to the_ acknowledging the Papacy.
In other words they were not, Roman Catholics.
Their leader, was, Archbishop Laud, Charles I's Archbishop, Archbishop of Canterbury sixteen thirty-three, into the sixteen forties, when Parliament arrested him.
So, that's why they're often called 'Laudian'.
Why they're called 'Arminian', because, they took a lot of their ideas from a breakaway member of the Dutch-Calvanist Church who flourished in the late sixteenth century, who, um, revived the ideas of free will, to the horror of his Calvinist colleagues.
Becau_ the Laudians then, or the Arminians believe_ revive the, uh, notion associated with the Catholic Church, of free will, for getting to heaven.
Three, 'Puritan'.
The term 'Puritan', is one of these words which have band_ which is bandied around rather vaguely and generally.
Um, like, um, fascist, communist, racist, or left-wing today.
The problem with it, it's a very imprecise portmanteau term.
Who counts as a left-winger today.
Much depends on your own prejudices and standpoint.
Um, and a lot of ink has been spilt, trying to define, what a Puritan is, or was.
Um, basically, English Puritans, well it's the term confined to England, or i_ the English tradition, derived from, John Calvin.
Or the teachings of John Calvin, some sort of variant.
Um, they tended to believe in predestination, in, a rather severe and simple church service.
An emphasis on the Bible, Bible study, an emphasis on Christ.
Certainly not on the Virgin Mary.
Um, emphasis on singing psalMs  uh, so, that is the common denominators.
But, once you've, um, said that, the Puritan movement is, very wide-ranging.
And, at it's borders, you can argue whether someone was a Puritan or not.
Um, in, England, in this period, we can discern three principle factions.
One, is, what might be called, Episcopalian Puritans.
Puritans who accept, the, the structure, the government of the Church of England, that is bishops and the monarch as supreme governor.
They're not against bishops.
But they want a service purged of Catholic remnants, and much more like the Genevan model of Calvin.
So a simpler, severer service and a stern whitewashed church.
Y- no candles on the alter.
In fact a communion table in the middle of the church.
That sort of thing.
But basically, they don't want to rock the boat too much.
Elizabeth's problem was that most keen Protestants were a bit like this, in her reign, whether the clergy or the gentry.
Two, Presbyterians.
Very similar, but they wanted to get rid of bishops, as well.
Um, they wanted a church, like the then Scottish Church or the Genevan Church, which was governed by, sort of committees of elders, and guess what, clergymen.
But without, a superior sort of clergyman, the bishop, over them.
They were essentially a clerical movement.
Um, many, gentry who were Puritan in the first sense, wouldn't support Presbyterianism, because they thought it gave too much power to the clergy.
Under the settlement as it was, the, local gentry often appointed the parish clergyman.
Under Presbyterianism, the clergyman might make a come back.
Three, separatists, more extreme Puritans.
The ancestors of the Civil War sects of the sixteen forties.
Who didn't want a state church of any sort.
Unlike, one and two, who believed in state church, the separatists, later called independents, believed that every congregation should be self-governing.
Um, that of course, none of the elite could put up with.
From the queen downwards.
Because, religion was the main transmitter of the ideas of those in control, to the masses.
And a separatist self-government church does not just mean a private, religious affair, as it does now.
It means that, you're almost claiming self-government for yourself in most areas of life, and, obliquely, whatever you said in public, you were saying, 'we won't bother to obey the queen, or the local squire,' ha ha, etcetera.
So, separatists were, quite, viciously persecuted, in the fifteen nineties.
One, example of a separatist is Martin Marprelate.
No one knows who he really was, there are theories.
But he wrote pamphlets, advocating separatism, in London, in fifteen eighty-nine.
But they were an extreme fringe, a radical low middle class fringe.
The Pilgrim Fathers were separatists, and um, significantly, they were in exile in Amsterdam before they sailed to America.
They came back to Plymouth to, equip themselves out.
But in sixteen twenty, before they went to, what became New England, they were in_ in exile in Amsterdam.
The Dutch were more tolerant.
Um, besides, um, these factions, within Protestantism, you might say, 'what about pure Anglicanism.
' Well, for a long time, Elizabeth's time until the Laudians arose, um, the juxtaposition which you find rather clumsily in many history books, and in the popular mind of people who know a little history, but not very much.
That there were Puritans over here and Anglicans over there, is, um, total misreading.
Most, moderate, Puritans were Anglicans, and most moderate Anglicans were Puritans.
It's only after sixteen sixty you get that sort of division.
Um, a greater, thing, problem, which, um, all sincere Christians of all, denominations or persuasions had to deal with, is popular superstition.
A lot of the ordinary people, were, um, not properly Christian at all.
But_ in any mode, but, um, exhibited a hodge-podge of regrettable tray, um, incomprehension, poor understanding of Christianity, um, pre-Christian superstitions, drunkenness, debauchery, and sinning.
Well, some of the elite could be sinners as well.
And, um, religious activists of all sorts, wanted to try and get rid of this, um, th- the_ this, behaviour.
The Puritans, very unfairly called it 'Popish survival'.
But in fact, if you look at contemporary Roman Catholic clergy, on the continent or underground in England, they also deplored it.
Um, now then, let us focus on the Puritans for a while, who are always considered a critic_ critical of the church settlement of Elizabeth.
And, even more so of that of the early Stuarts.
In Elizabeth's time, the Puritans were not yet, in any sense a revolutionary civil war people of the sixteen forties.
Um, they were, a minority ginger group, within the church establishment.
Um, they annoyed the queen, because they ran counter to her wish for comprehension.
Elizabeth's church someone wittily said, was not concerned, so much with the peace of the Kingdom of God, as the peace of the Kingdom of England.
Elizabeth wanted to make it as wide as possible, um, crudely speaking, Protestant doctrine, but a lot of Catholic ritual.
So Catholic-minded people who weren't attached to the Pope, could feel comfortable in it.
She'd got_ you know, she didn't want to drive Catholic-minded people into the arms of Rome, by imposing a severely Calvinist church.
Um, also, Elizabeth, was a rather conservative Protestant, and certainly a pre-Calvinist one.
She, had conformed during her sister's Ma- Mary's reign, the Catholic Reaction, and had never been in exile in Geneva.
Her religious views were probably a mixture of her own father, Henry VIII's Catholicism without the Pope, mixed with Cramner's teachings.
The bishop, the archbishop of her father and her brother Edward.
Mixed with some influence from Lutherans of [Ingli] but definitely pre-Calvinist.
The only problem is, for her, that, the Calvinists were the most enthusiastic group of, Protestants.
Particularly the ones who had been in Maryan exile.
The most obnoxious to her of all was the Scotsman, John Knox.
Whom she sent packing back to Scotland, and he was a Protestant Ayatollah figure.
Within a few years, he'd overthrown Mary's Catholic Papist cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, and set up a sort of theocracy in Scotland.
However, there were factors for modification, in conflict between the queen and the Puritans.
The queen needed them for support against, the Catholic threat, internal or external, from Spain.
And they needed the queen for the same reason.
She was a guarantor of any Catholic church_ of any Protestant, sorry, church at all.
There's no alternative.
It's not a question of either having Elizabeth's halfway house, or, a fully-fledged Calvinist church, it was a question of having Elizabeth's, they thought, imperfectly reformed church, or having a Catholic comeback.
So, they and the queen, had to prop each other up.
Um, they also had powerful, moderate friends at court.
There was a whole group of moderate Puritans around Elizabeth.
For_ the Earl of Leicester, who, a peculiar character in some ways, his lifestyle was anything but Puritan.
I won't go into the details, you can imagine, lots of girlfriends.
Including, briefly, the queen herself.
At least he wanted to marry her.
Um, but nevertheless, he seems to have been sincerely Puritan in a religious way.
His brother Warwick, the Earl of Bedford, the Russell Earl, that is.
Sir Francis Walsingham, head of Elizabeth's secret service.
All very strongly Puritan sympathizers at court.
Um, even Whitgift, who in the political sense, the archbishop who oppresses the Puritans in the fifteen nineties.
His theology isn't very far apart, he believes in predestination, of some sort.
The fifteen nineties does seem_ see a hardening of th- the line of Elizabeth and Whitgift against the Puritans.
Or at least Puritans who won't conform, because, they're no longer needed against the Spanish threat which is, that we're at_ England was at war with Spain, but the Spanish threat is fading.
Um, the separatists get particularly badly treated, and some of them are executed.
As for moderate mainstream middle and upper class Puritans, they decide, to conform more or less.
After all, conformity, was not very rigourous.
Um, you, you just had to read the present formaries.
You didn't really have to decorate the church in an elaborate Anglo-Catholic way, that hadn't been revived.
So, it's probable out in the shires, the squire and parson had a semi-Calvinist service anyway.
Well, James I, now, the Scottish monarch, Elizabeth's cousin, succeeds in sixteen oh three, dies in sixteen twenty-five.
He is very anti-Puritan in theory.
Paradoxically, presumed brought up by the church that many English Puritan's thought was ideal, the Scottish Kerk.
James didn't like it because, they brought him up.
Um, he was brought up in it.
Uh, they were always tactfully on about his wicked Popish whoring mother, whom he didn't know.
Um, his tutor was a severe Scottish Calvinist clergyman called Buchanan.
Learned in Renaissance learning, who, used to beat him badly.
Uh, the Calvinists, although they tolerated monarchy had no great respect for it necessarily.
Buchanan used to boast that he had tanned the_ tanned the arse of the Lord's annointed.
When James was sixteen, sitting in St.
Giles's Cathedral at Edinburgh, um, he'd done_ he was just beginning to, flap his wings as an adolescent king.
The_ the, preacher, referred to him, from the pulpit, as 'God's silly vassal'.
No English preacher, preaching to an English monarch in the sixteenth century ever did that.
So James loved the Anglican elements of the English Church, and he assimilated the English Puritans, to the Scottish Calvinists.
And he was determined to, put them down.
At, the Hampton Court Conference in sixteen oh three, he said, 'conform, or I'll harry you out of the land.
' In spite of all this though, um, James didn't in fact oppress the moderate Puritan element, in the Church of England.
He promoted, churchmen of various shades of opinion, including the young high churchman, William Lord, got a bishopric.
But only the bishopric of St.
David's.
And the archbishop of sixteen oh nine, um, into the sixteen twenties, Archbishop Abbott, was_ had Puritan sympathies.
Now the Puritans, had, long had a pr- program for remedying, the problems of the church.
Pluralism, lack of an educated preaching clergy in some areas.
And, that's one reason why they got a lot of support.
They were a_ a positive group who wanted to_ besides their specific theology, they wanted to right the shortcomings of the church.
Um, now however, in the sixteen twenties, they were rivalled by the Arminians, the high churchmen.
Who also had this sort of program.
And their leader was William Lord, sixteen seventy-three_ fifteen seventy-three, sixteen forty-five.
In sixteen twenty-five James died, his young son Charles, the ill-fated Charles I comes to the throne.
Whereas James had balanced religious factions within the church in his promotions, Charles gives the Arminians their head.
Um, sixteen twenty-eight, Lord is Archbishop of London.
Sixteen thirty-three he's Archbishop of Canterbury, and in fact, he runs the church as Archbishop of London, because, Archbishop Abbott is too ill.
And, in the sixteen thirties, you get an active re-Catholicising program, of the Church of England.
Spearheaded by Lord, backed by the king.
Um, it's in fact, you get a sort of extremism from above.
A sort of revolution from above.
Um, and this, forces the vast mass of moderate Puritans, in the country, uh, both clerical and lay, into opposition.
Um, they are probably the largest element in the Church of England.
A sort of moderate Puritanism.
Moderate Puritanism, you might even say is the established religion of the country.
It's not anti-Episcopalian, it is not anti-royalist.
However, um, because of the Laudians' counter offensive, the vast mass, p'raps, of English people are forced into_ certainly the English ruling elite, and uh, public opinion, middle class, forced into opposition to the bishops in the sixteen thirties.
And eventually, into opposition to the monarchy itself.
Um, in sixteen forty, forty-two, at the time of the long Parliament.
It's the Laudian counter-offensive, the re-Catholicising of the Church of England, seems to attack what is by now, traditional English Protestantism, after three generations, and it's one of the major, p'raps the major cause of the English Civil War of the sixteen forties, in which both Lord and Charles lose their heads, famously."
"I came to Oxford two years ago now.
And, um, i, i came here because, basically, because, uh, i was interest- i, i was interested_ th_ there were, the supervisor_ there was a person, who is now my supervisor, who was interested in the field i am working in.
So, i didn't came to Oxford in the beginning.
Just because, i like Oxford, or because i liked England.
I came for very definite purpose.
And, uh, beginning i applied, i also applied to other universities.
There was Southampton, and, uh, uh, Royal Halloway.
And, uh, because there, there were also, people interested in, uh, old music subjects, early music subjects.
But then, i, i, got a place in Oxford.
And i choosed_ i choosed the_ here, because, um, because my supervi_ because i, i'm happy.
I was happy to work with my supervisor.
And my former tutor in Italy advised me to co_ to go here as well.
To come here.
And, my... My first experience as i came here... Was, uh, well was ve_ was very sort of being in a, in a sort of very strange place.
Perhaps because Oxford is a very strange university, on it's own.
With a college_ a college system.
Which i was completely unused to it.
And, uh, i think as most of the people who come from abroad are.
And, ev_ even for people who co_ for people that come from this country.
But, if you are not accustomed to this system.
Which is rather exceptional.
And, um, in fact i, i didn't_ th_ for the fact_ for the thing which astounded me, is that the system at this university is not at all clear.
How it works, and how it goes.
How it, how it goes on.
And yo_ until you ask, uh, you ask all the_ or uh, as, as, as many people as possible, you don't really get an idea of how, how to get things done.
How to get things made.
And that's s- s- s- that's very, that's very strange at the beginning.
Because, uh, well in a way it resembles how thing_ how things work in Italian university.
But, uh... Ha ha.
But, um, which i didn't expect to find here.
But, it's the sa_ exactly the same thing.
And, if not in a way_ if not in a way even more, uh, muddled.
Uh, i think that partly depends because, um, uh, because of the colleges.
And the faculties which are sort of independent republics.
Work on their own.
And each, each has it's own laws and, uh, and provisions.
And, uh... Sometimes at variance with each other.
Which, uh, is_ uh, with, with the faculty they have got their own timetables, their own, uh, uh, uh, deadlines for, for, for example for, for, giving in, uh, applicati_ applications to, to scholarships and, uh, and similar things.
So well its st_ it was a quite strange experience.
As for_ as for college, i don't really lead very much of a college life, because, um, uh, i've found th_ i found all the formal meetings, formal sessions very boring.
I was_ i didn't come here just to, to, to make, uh, to make myself known as a_ as a college dandy, actually.
I wasn't_ not interested in it, uh_ actually most of my friends which i've got now are from_ are in London arou_ as well, no_ not, not here.
So i just see the college as a place where_ i don't live in college any longer.
I used to live in college for two years.
But now i live in outside.
I live in a private accommodation.
And i just to college to, to read my email, and to_ if my pigeon hole mail that's all.
So, and to go to hall sometimes to_ for eating.
And, uh, as for my_ as for my faculty experiences.
My um, study experience, fortunately enough, i got a very good supervisor.
I mean he's very_ sometimes he's difficult to understand.
Um, because he's very_ he's got a very active and very quick mind.
And he had to follow him very very hardly.
But he, he's got very, very illuminating ideas.
And he's very helpful.
Although he never really says whether you are_ whether you should do_ should choose a certain direction or not.
Because he thinks it should be on your own, that you decide.
Because you should know what you like, or not.
He doesn't want to influence you.
And someti_ at the beginning i found myself very, at odds with this.
I found it very, awkward.
Because, um, [cough] i was very uncertain on, on, on the path i should take.
I'd already got one, but he did_ didn't quite agree with it.
So, i had to change it completely, and it took me one year to do this.
Also because, uh, in my first year i had to attend some courses.
Some master, master courses, even if i didn't get the master, actually, because i didn't_ i wasn't following a master course.
And, uh, this took me_ too_ took me to_ all my ti_ time for my research, and i could start just in the following year, basically.
Um, i don't see my supervisor on a, on a very regular basis.
I see him just when i've got, works_ some work do_ work done th_ that i want to show him.
And where i find it_ wh_ what i find relaxing is that he doesn't really press me.
I mean if i, if i don't see him for months he doesn't say anything.
And he_ and w- want to contact him.
I just write a note, and i just drop him an email, and then, uh, we arrange a meeting.
But it's, um, quite in a, in a reasonable amount of time.
No_ not very long t_ so this is very helpful.
I, i don't like to be pressed upon very much.
I like to be, to be working on my own.
Basically, all the works i'm doing is my own, so it doesn't really... As an art student  of course i didn't_ i don't work on a_ i don't work in a, on a, in a team or so.
So, i work at home, i t- tend to_ i tend to, um, um...As an art student, i sometimes feel working alone, um, i was elated because i work on my own all the time.
And even if i go to the library, i tend to borrow books, and, ta_ take them back home.
Because i feel more comfortable.
I mean, and i need my own space.
I need my own time ta_ ta_ to attend to_ to expand and, to, to, to, to, as_ as much time as i've got to expand on it very much.
And to spread on the time i've got very much.
And, uh, so, yeah i work on my own most of time.
And... But now i'm, i'm very comfortable now in this, in this situation.
I feel_ sometimes i feel more at home here than in my own country.
So, i don't know whether th_ this is being adaptive, or just because, uh, i like it.
I canno- i cannot say it now_ it just, um, i get_ i'm getting just used to it, and i'm_ i, i, i, can say i like it, basically, yeah."
"The Anglo Saxons, these were Germanic tribes, who came to Britain, from the early fifth century A-D, with the fall of the Roman Empire.
Now, the Victorian nineteenth-century image of them, is rather romantic.
For the Victorians, they were the archetype, the ancestor, of Victorian England.
Um, represented, as a slightly cruder version of the public school sports hero.
Blonde, brash, hearty, but essentially good-hearted, and moral, and good fighters.
Obvious_ but always fighters of a good cause of course.
Obviously, there are many ways, in which that was an over-simplification.
The most obvious way is that, early, Anglo Saxons were nothing like, or very little like, upper-middle, or upper-class nineteenth century English people.
Um, except insofar as, all human beings have a certain resemblance.
Um, one way, indeed, is a sheer mystery.
We know very little about the early Anglo Saxons.
From say about 440 to 7 A-D.
Um, we have to rely on hostile writings.
The writings of the Welsh.
Ha, I'm Welsh myself, and let's say the Welsh were more civilised at the time.
They had preserved Christianity, and Latin.
So, the Welsh in both Latin, and old Welsh, gave a hostile accounts of the Anglo Saxon invaders.
There was no Anglo Saxon writing, until the Wenerable Bede, the monk who wrote after 700 A-D.
And did a general_ very good history, of the conversion to Christianity of his English people.
But that's the first coherent writing, from an Anglo Saxon, himself.
And, even after that, for the next few hundred years, until 1066, there are, of course, Anglo Saxon, uh, documents.
Both in Anglo Saxon itself, and in Latin.
But, relatively fewer than you might expect.
Even after Anglo Saxon England becomes more civilized.
Um, but, what we do know about early Anglo Saxons, is that they were pagan.
They seemed to worship the horse.
P'raps that is a bit like upper class Victorians, and, um, they went in for human sacrifice quite possibly.
Certainly animal sacrifice which is not.
What about the Anglo Saxon language.
Well it's only one input into modern English.
We have to consider, the vast contribution of Latin, whether directly through Latin, or through French.
There have been certain waves of French input, for example, Norman French obviously.
Come to a later lecture.
Um, and from the seventeenth century.
Seventeenth and eighteenth century.
Um, in fact, Anglo Saxon is very much a different language from modern English.
You might say that's obvious, over fifteen hundred years, all languages change quite a lot.
But, let us consider the language of the Anglo Saxons' great rivals in Britain, the Welsh, or Romano-Britons.
The Welsh, spoken and written, written note, in 600 A-D, is much closer to modern Welsh, than Anglo-Saxon is to modern English.
In fact, it can be understood by a Welsh reader.
Um, you can say the same about the German of the period, and present day German.
Even older, classical Greek is much closer to modern Greek, than Anglo Saxon is to modern English.
Anglo Saxon, educated Anglo Saxon fell out of favour, when the French speaking Normans took over.
It's the same with blood, as far as we can tell.
There have been vast, previous, and subsequent infusions into England's bloodlines.
The Celtic and pre-Celtic populations, of what's now England, were not driven out, as the Victorians thought.
They were simply absorbed by the Anglo Saxon.
And then, um, later on in the Anglo Saxon period itself, the Vikings came, related but different, from Scandinavia.
Then you had the Normans themselves.
You have waves of the Flemings from the low countries.
Um, Dutch and Huguenot, of_ that's French, protestant refugees in the sixteenth, seventeenth century.
To say, um, immigrants in the nineteenth century, Irish and Jewish people, to say nothing of the more, better known, twentieth-century immigrations.
So we're not as the Victorians thought, overwhelmingly descended from Anglo Saxons.
To say nothing of internal immigration.
I find every Englishman today, has a Celtic grandmother, Scots, Irish, and Welsh.
Because England's richer than the Celtic countries.
Um, the ... Word Engle is used fairly early, but there's no mention of England, or Engleland until circa 971.
Um, so, the Anglo Saxons might have made England, but most of the time they had no overall concept of it.
Just as the Amer-Indians had no concept of North America.
As opposed to their own bit of it, as far as we can tell.
Um, overall, their, their heroic warrior-age culture, and their subsistence peasant economy is very remote from us.
But, also, we mustn't go in for Victorian romanticisations, but Anglo Saxon contributions are genuine.
Christianity, number one, took permanent root, in what is now England.
And there was a great flow-in of art.
And, particularly manuscript illumination, um, from it.
And even some Anglo Saxon architecture survives.
Not very much.
But, in Oxford you have the tower of St.
Michael the Northgate, for example.
Late Anglo Saxon, much restored.
Then there's, um, for the age, an excellent local government set up.
The shire system was set up.
All the counties.
Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, come from their Anglo Saxon names, Anglo Saxon construct.
Astonishingly, the Anglo Saxon counties lasted with little alteration, or shires, from King Edgar 959 to 1974, when a recent government changed them drastically.
Towns and villages were founded.
Oxford itself by Alfred the Great in the late ninth century, as a fortress town, and a new town, for example.
And, the, the place names are for_ all over the place on the map.
Anglo Saxon place names.
Bedford, Oxford, you name it.
Um, Abbingdon.
Uh, right.
Also, of course our names of the week.
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, are named for Anglo Saxons gods, a pagan survival.
The Kingdom of England itself, has continuous existence from the 10th Century to today.
And the Queen is a direct descendant of the King of Wessex, Alfred the Great, who died in 899.
And various institutions, i-e the Institution of the Sherifdom was simply taken over by the Normans in 1066.
I've said that um, the Anglo Saxon element and language, in our language, English language, is not the only one, but is the one we use most.
Even though it's been estimated that sixty percent of our language is from Latin, in one way or another, and only thirty percent from Anglo Saxon.
It's the one that we use most, for all sorts of everyday things.
Doghouse, man, woman, relative clauses, who, whom, my, me, you.
Um, it's also the one we use for all our deep feelings.
We say, I hope sincerely, 'i love you.
' That's pure Anglo Saxon.
If we said, 'you activate my amorous propensities,' pure Latin, it would sound totally ridiculous.
Um, so Latin tends to be used in educated discourse, of course, for specialist professional registers.
But, everyday, if you analyse what people are saying, it's more Anglo Saxon than Latin.
So, in short, I would say, the Anglo Saxons are perhaps the defining element in our culture.
But, English_ England is very much a stew, rather than one single, plain meal."
"The Boer War, eighteen ninety-nine, nineteen oh two.
It is now, a hundred years since.
The Dutch colony, on the Cape, of Good Hope, the first white settlement in Africa, was taken over by the Britons, or the British, for strategic reasons, in eighteen fifteen.
The Dutch had been perforce, Napoleon's allies, and therefore on the losing side, after Waterloo.
Um, the Brits, therefore, took over, a [Kahiran] community, of mainly Dutch Calvinist colonists.
The, um, Boers are not_ as they were known, Boers are farmers in Dutch.
They're not entirely Dutch by, by blood.
Um, because, they, were intermixed with, French and German Protestants.
Which is why, some Afrikaners have French names.
And, although they would hate to admit it, they probably have a certain infusion of black blood from earlier on.
Um, but Dutch, predominates.
Although the dialect had become rather different, and is now present-day Afrikaans, from classic_ from official Dutch.
And of course, the Dutch colonists naturally resented, being ruled by the British.
And the British, did not take to the Dutch particularly.
Who they regard as obscurantist, narrow-minded Calvinists, and relatively uneducated.
So, in eighteen thirty-eight you have the Great Trek of certain, um, Boers, or_ to the interior.
Um, northeast, the famous ox-wagon walk.
And, when, they get to a suitable place, on the Transvaal River, they found the two little republics of the Orange Free State, and the Transvaal.
And there for several decades, they're left much to themselves, until the eighteen eighties.
The British, have at that time, no great expansionist, ambitions, into the African interior.
The Cape of Good Hope is fine for them.
Beautiful Mediterranean climate etcetera, strategically important.
And, um, so on.
But, in the eighteen eighties, things change.
A, there's a great imperial expansion of all European powers.
Britain needed the Boer republics for strategic reasons.
If only to stop the Germans getting them.
Uh, or establishing a protectorate over them.
The Boers themselves, preferred the Germans.
Who they regarded as closer, racially, and religiously.
And, anyway the Germans were not British.
They preferred them to the British.
Um, you have the ambitions of Rhodes, the diamond millionaire who_ gold millionaire who's now the prime minister of Cape Colony.
The ambitions of the colonial secretary, Joe Chamberlain, etcetera.
Um, B, I mentioned diamonds.
Um, there is, there's sudden wealth in the Transvaal.
Diamond, um, mines are discovered.
This changes the Transvaal from bankrupt semi r- rusticity, um, into quite a rich little place.
It's the equivalent of finding oil in an impoverished desert Sheikhdom, seventy years later.
Uh, the Transvaal, and to a lesser extent, the Orange Free State, was now valuable.
So, um, the British start putting pressure on the two Boer republics.
Um, there're, several issues.
The Uitlander issue, the treatment of the Uitlanders.
The Uitlanders were, non-Boers, mainly British, but they needn't be British, who came there to run, and exploit the diamond minds.
But were treated by the Boers as s- uh, second_ not exactly even citizens.
Uh, deprived, they alleged, of civil rights, um, by the Boers.
Uh, they were not allowed to vote or anything, they were just allowed to work.
In fact, one can feel in hindsight, less sorry for the Uitlanders than, they, claimed to feel for themselves.
Um, because they were making a lot of money through being in the Transvaal.
They didn't have to be there, they hadn't been taken there as slaves.
As the Boer President Kruger said, 'this is my country, these are my laws, anyone who doesn't like my laws, can leave my country.
' But, the British, had great sympathy, as you might expect, for the Uitlanders.
Fanned by the press of the day.
The British claimed that the Boers had already accepted a light British protectorate.
In, eighteen seventy-nine, the Boers of the Transvaal had, felt menaced by the then powerful, Zulu Kingdom, Native Zulu Kingdom.
And had to_ sought British help, and the British had, um, exacted the price that they should place themselves, vaguely under the Br_ umbrella of the the British Empire.
But the Boers claimed that had only been a temporary agreement.
Anyway, um, negotiations on these two issues broke down.
Partially because the British wanted it to.
Chamberlain and Rhodes, um, as far as we can see, wanted war.
They wanted to settle the_ these cheeky, um, Dutch farmers once and for all.
And, at first, however, the Boers had considerable military success.
Because they went on the attack, first.
The British were caught by surprise.
Didn't have that many troops in South Africa.
Um, however, of course, at that time the British Empire was probably the greatest power in the world.
Troops from both India and Britain were sent out there.
And once reinforcements had arrived, the Boers, for what_ whatever their skill and their knowledge of the country might be, could not win conventionally.
Um, once you had U-K troops there in great numbers.
So by nineteen hundred, they'd been defeated conventionally, after bitter and impressive resistance.
And, the war, was declared over, by the British.
Unfortunately, the Boers hadn't read the textbook, and for, two years, the Boers impressed, with their heroic and skillful guerilla warfare on the veld.
Which of course they knew intimately, and the British knew not at all.
Um, they had certain other advantages, the other great powers, France, Germany, Russia, and America.
You name them, took the side of the Boers, and heartily disapproved of Britain's action.
Partly out of self-interest.
There was Britain aggrandising her empire even more.
Partly out of, genuine compassion.
Um, the whole thing looked very much like a classic David against Goliath.
International sympathy for the Boers, were increased when the, British instituted concentration camps.
Now then_ this was the first time the, name was used.
They're emphatically not meant to be like the concentration camps of the Nazis or of the Stalinists.
The big idea was to round up, the Boer woman and children from the farms, uh, on the veld.
So_ and, concentrate them in camps, so that, the womenfolk could stop supplying their mem_ menfolk with food and general comfort, when the menfolk were out fighting.
To cut off the, Boer fighters' source of reply_ supplies.
The problem was, once you'd herded the Boer people into the camps, everything was badly thought out.
Sanitary arrangements were primitive.
People who'd been used to leading a healthy life on the veld, caught diseases from each other very easily when they were, um, concentrated together in, numbers of, thousands.
All that sort of thing.
And many Boer woman and children, died.
Secondly, the British hadn't organised enough food.
So, there was also malnutrition, which hastened death.
And, um, so you_ photography was well-developed, of course, by the time.
So, the European public, including the British public, were treated, to pictures of white woman and children, looking very much like themselves, either looking, um, emaciated and half-starving, very ill, or indeed dead.
And this caused a great outcry.
In fact, it caused an outcry in Britain itself.
Many liberals, started to speak up for, and defend the Boers.
Including the leader of the Liberal Party, Campbell Bannerman, and an up and coming, young Liberal politician, the Welshman Lloyd George.
Lloyd George spoke, uh, for, ending the war, and for compromise with the Boers, in Joe Chamberlain's Birmingham.
As a result he nearly got lynched himself.
He had to go through the back door of the hall disguised as a policeman.
Um, the Boers were forced to give in in nineteen oh two.
And the peace terms the British, awarded them were rather generous.
Um, and, this led the way to the federation of the Cape Colony, Natal, and the Orange Free State, and Transvaal, into the Dominion of South Africa, within a few years.
The Boer guerilla leaders become responsible South African statesman, rather loyal to the Crown.
The, most obvious example of this is General Smuts.
Who was_ in old age, was Prime Minister of, um, South Africa, up to nineteen forty-eight, and receives, um, the king and queen, now Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.
I believe he also received the, present queen, which is young Princess Elizabeth.
Um, on the whole, however, um, the Boers were unreconciled to British Rule.
Or Afrikaaners, as the came to be known.
So what is the legacy of the Boer War.
It fuelled the historical myth of Afrikaanerdom.
Every society has a historical myth, needs one.
Which is different from actual objective eco_ uh, academic history.
It fuelled their self-image of heroic fighters.
There're other ingredients in it, the Great Trek itself, uh, the Calvinism, and everything.
And, for a time, the Boers in fact won, in their modern Afrikaner nomination.
The Nationalist Party comes to power in nineteen forty-eight.
And, you have ,what is the Boer republic, really.
Um, until, it crumbles in nineteen ninety-four, just a few years ago.
But now in many ways, the Boer War is passing into historical irrelevance.
Which is rather different, from just passing into a remote historical past.
Which is a rather different thing.
Um, because, uh, the people who were neglected, even taken for granted, by both sides in the Boer War, are now the dominant people in South Africa.
And, are the people who, dominate the government.
That is the Black African Community, who are, three quarters of, the, um, South African populationthe Boers are, or Afrikaners as we must now call them.
I believe the word Boer's recently been outlawed, ironically, by a Black Government as racist.
Ha ha.
The Boers are a very interesting, um, uh, group.
Rather like the Quebecois.
Um, they, had been in, uh, Africa so long.
They might almost be considered white natives, white Africans.
And it's ironical that the Great War of_ major war of this high imperial time for the British, was not against non-white indigenes, or against another, great colonial European power.
But against this strange group, of long established, non-British white settlers."
"I recently picked up a book and read, um, The Celestine Prophecy.
I'm not sure who the author was.
I think his name was Arthur Redding or, something like that, but it's not important.
Um, I guess it's considered, um_ sorry I guess it's considered a, new age type book, where the ideas in it are something that people, of this generation and the last generation are just starting to, um, really talk about.
It dealt with, um_ it dealt with a manuscript found in ancient, ancient Peru, which described how... At_ toward the end of the millennium,which is coming up on us, you know, you, um, people would change, people, humans would change their, their evolution.
Things would happen to em where we would have a higher understanding of life and why we're supposed to be here.
And this book created such an interest in me.
I ju- it sparked me.
And, I can_ it's a work of fiction.
But I can only hope that this is the way it's gonna be.
Um, basically it said that, nothing at all happens by coincidence for no reason.
Everything that happens in our life, ev- every llittle, every little thing, every little person we meet, there's a deeper meaning for it.
And, what's going to happen.
There were nine stages of, um_ there were nine insights basically.
And, the first one dealt with... A lot of_ uh,  a critical mass, it was called, a lot of people realizing at once, well, starting to realize, that this change is coming.
Um, the second one dealt with history, the history of, um, human evolution basically.
And that, if you_ it stated that if you look at humans... If you look at the, the human race as a history.
As a whole, not as different times, but as a whole, you can see how we've been evolving right from the beginning toward, toward what we are now.
And, um, the next one's, they're, they were pretty... Pretty deep, pretty, um, pretty out there actually.
Uh, it dealt with... It dealt with the universe as a matter of energy.
And everything in the universe was an extension of its energy.
And we as people, are, are energy from the universe.
And so far as that, we could even interact with people and share other people's energy.
And when people, when people talk to each other they're, they are sharing their energy and they are becoming stronger.
When people have a fight with someone, they are trying to take their energy away from them.
And, um, the book even dealt with people, able to see this energy.
And, I mean it got_ it was, it was_ it struck me so much that I actually tried to, look at people and see energy.
And, I thought that was a bit wacky.
But, um, yeah it was um_ so that that basically was it.
It was, it was a story it was a fiction.
It was an adventure of a man who went down to Peru to actually investigate for himself, what the manuscript, had said.
And, um, through the book he was being chased by, um, government officials in Peru because they didn't want ,the manuscript, the manuscript to get out because they thought it would create a revolt against the church.
When in fact, the manuscript was able to, give real meaning to what the church was.
Like not just the church of, um_ not just like the Catholic Church, but all religions, basically are saying the same thing that, you know, we are all here for deeper meaning and this is it.
But it takes a_ um... It takes, it takes a lot like, to get into something like this because you have to, be willing to dis- you have to have like suspension of disbelief, or at least acceptance of far fetched ideas.
Or ideas that might seem far fetched to you.
Um, basically it came, it came down to it.
And, um, the guy got hold of all the insights and he, he realized that, um, his whole mission everything that was happening, like I said there were no coincidences.
Everything that was happening was geared for him to teach other people of the manuscript, and to, uh, pass the word on and, um, that's what wound up happening.
And, uh, since I've read the book it, it inspired me.
And I'm trying to get as many of my friends to read it as possible because I feel like... It's my job to, uh, to get people to realize this.
Because if people could realize_ I mean if_ even if this wasn't true, if people thought of each other as, just energy, it, it would reduce fighting.
It would reduce conflict.
And, um, it might bring about some positive changes toward human culture, as it said in the book.
So I'm hoping that more people will read that, and more people will react the same way as I did."
"The state is_ is a... Rather a hard, um, thing to define in political science.
In, in part because, um, there are so many contesting approaches to, uh, to what the state is.
And, um, many ways to define it.
Um, many people, uh, talk about its origins.
Other people use, um, use the state, uh, as a_ in a very instrumental functional way.
Other people talk about its nature, its supposed functions.
Um... And the reason why it is such a complex, term to define is because, um, since, uh, the French Revolution, we, we have seen the State growing, qualitatively and quantitat- quantitatively in terms of the things it does, and, and the things people expect the state to do.
Um, as we stand right now, um, i... (Can safe) that, um, the state used to be a very simple thing, um, in the Medieval Ages.
Um, it was a rather divine concept (sniff) um, personified by, by a king or an emperor.
Or s- s- some kind of individual who had the right to rule the rest of the population.
Um, and , uh, as, as capitalism, uh, evolved in democracy, um, the state has gone on to take, uh, a, a, number of, uh, of roles that would have been very hard for, uh, philosophers of the state a few centuries back to conceive.
Um, I guess, um, what we have in mind when we talk about the state,  uh, first and foremost is um, is, is a pact of domination.
Um, that is, um, the, the state is a set of organizations, um, that has the authority, to make, uh, binding decisions, uh, for people and groups, uh, located in a particular territory.
And in that sense a state is a reflection of, um, you know, social classes, and social groups in a society.
Um, but that, that is not all.
I mean if, if the state were just, uh, pacts of domination.
Then we could simply, uh, reduce it as an outgrowth of a, of a particular society.
Um, the state, in modern times has, also become a corporate, a corporate actor.
Uh, in other words, er, it has the power, the, the, the capacity and the ability, uh, independently of other social groups and organizations, to, um, to take its own actions, to, to set its own course.
Uh, it speaks for itself.
That's what we mean by corporate actor.
It is not always bound to the desires of, particular groups or, or individuals in societies.
It has its own interests.
Um but_ and, so related to this and, the_ to the fact that it is a corporate actor.
Um, it is also an arena of social conflict.
I mean, it is the most important corporate actor within a particular country.
So it is a last recourse that groups and, and individuals have, um, when, when they have, uh, conflicts that they, they cannot resolve by themselves.
Um, and finally because of, because it is an arena of social conflict, it is the guardian of the universal interests of society.
So, in these four different roles, um... An instrument, instrument of domination, um, a corporate actor, um, an arena of social conflict, and a guardian of the int- universal interests of society, we see a number of, uh, uh, conflicting um... A number of conflicting uh,traits about the state.
Um, it is, uh, it is, a set of organizations that has its own interests.
But it, it, in, in, in_ and it's supposed to mediate between itself_ among itself in other interests but it, it also has to be on the lookout for the overall interests of, of the whole society.
It can't just become, uh, a particularistic, um, uh, machine, uh, to sort out claiMs  um, it, it should also, um, take actions that are compatible with the interests of everybody, as one.
And, um, that's why i- it, its position is very ambiguous.
And it is very_ um, at times very difficult to discern, um.
And, uh, nowadays the state, the state activities range from everything from, uh, setting, uh, air quality standards to, uh, um, to, uh, to providing for a national defense to, uh, um education.
I mean it's, it, it is_ state activities are a spread uh, among all possible realms of social life.
Uh, social and individual life.
Uh, and um, that is why... The state as a concept its, its a, it's a very difficult one to tackle, in my opinion."
"Probably the_ another subject that has involved philosophers for quite a long time.
And it has probably fostered a lot of interaction between the scientific community, and the philosophical community.
Is the question of the brain, and how the brain works.
And, probably the most interesting things of all, have been the models that have come forth, uh, through the century, as to how the brain actually behaves.
What is actually going on in your mind, when you actually perceive, um, a given object, or have a given idea.
Probably the most, um, interesting model that has come about especially, uh, in the mid to late, uh, twentieth century with regard to the brain.
And this goes a long way from the, the eighteenth and seventeenth century ideas, of the homunculus in the mind.
As we, as we, um, had many philosophers honestly believe that they were men.
Or, or shall we say, a, uh, cognizant men that existed within the brain.
That were responsible for the emotions and for the rational, functions of the mind.
And the homunculi were responsible for individual thoughts and e- emotions and, uh, preferences, opinions and beliefs etc.
Um, the Reductio ad absurdum [Latin term] was that each homunculus therefore had a smaller homunculus in its own brain that... Altered its emotions and altered its, um, rational states etc.
And this, um, Reductio ad absurdum didn't sit very well.
Um.
As the enlightenment passed over the Western tradition.
And led us into believing, um, that, and especially with Lemaitre and others who believed in the mechanization of the human body and the human mind.
Um, such, such great, uh, discoveries, um and adding machines, such as Blaise Pascal’s adding machine and Leibniz's um, computer_ well shall we say primitive computer.
As well as the work of Allan Turing led many to start to think of the brain in terms of, uh, computation.
That is start to think of the brain as being a computer.
And psychology as merely being the software that is the, the, the pattern by which the computer determines what it should compute, um, and what its output actually is.
And this philosophy was regard_ was called the functionalism or referred to as functionalism.
And found its late twentieth century, uh, proponents in the persons of Hilary Putnam, and John Searle.
And both of whom now in the waning stages of the twentieth century have seen_ um, have referred to functionalism as metaphysical realism.
Or as metaphysical nonsense so to speak.
That the brain can be, uh, described as just a set of, uh, individual adding machines isn't acceptable, um, within the view of emotivism and the, the revolutions that have come about in linguistics and cognitive psychology.
The Turing machine model, or shall we say the functionalist model.
Um, sought, um, interactions between individual Turing machines that churned out questions to logical, uh, propositions, impinged upon the brain, um, by the environment.
Given to the brain by the environment.
The Turing machines, um, had_ were able to give the human brain complex emotions because they in- uh, interacted, um, dependently upon each other.
That is they interacted cooperatively.
But the view that a Turing machine can, give rise to grammars, or shall we say give rise to, um, patterns of logic, um, that do not adhere to se_ given semantic requirements.
That is emotions for example.
How can one possibly generate a grammar or generate, a scheme of logic that expresses something that isn't in_ of, in and of itself, irreducible to the tenets of logic.
Um, obviously put the functionalists, um, on the defensive.
Further advances in actually understanding the structure of the brain, um, by such biological researchers as Romonica Hull and Camino Golgi and the re_ um works, among important linguistics, uh, experts.
Um, such as Chomsky.
Um,and such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Saul Kripke have given, um, further evidence that the structure of the brain, and ideas with regard to the construction of grammars.
Make it much more complicated than merely the idea of a computer, set to zero.
And then given some very basal set of instructions.
Um, and then allowed to interact with neighboring, um, computers, um, or neighboring Turing machines to produce emotion.
And ha- has come about, um, in a fashion that has weeded, weeded out a lot of the weak points of the brain computer, um, continuum.
And brought into the idea, of innate structures within the brain.
Um, these, these coming from, um, Chomsky whose ideas of an innate grammar, that children for example learn language because there are structures within the brain that preexist or predate, um, experience with, um, with vocalization.
Um, a- and have been proven or have been shown, um, with, with great_ with, of_ with very little doubt on the point of cognitive scientist, neuroscientists and, and cognitive psychologists.
Um, so the belief now becom_ has resided in not necessarily a, a brain that is composed of interacting Turing machines.
But a dynamic brain.
A brain that is shifting.
Um, the Nobel prize winner, Gerald Edelman, came up with the idea of Neural Darwinism.
The idea that instead_ individual nuclei, that is collections of cells within the brain compete with one another whenever a new stimulus is introduced into the brain.
And, and this this view has been taken up by, um, Paul and Patricia Churchland.
And, um, also by the other Nobel prize winner, Frances Crick.
The idea that whenever a new experience enters the brain, um, those nuclei that are best adept at handling it , are the ones that fire_ that interact with one another.
And that in that firing they generate an environment that, that behooves their existence.
And that those, um, neurons within the brain that are not so a- adept at handling the new information.
Or are not, um, continuously in process of generating, um, internal functions.
That is thoughts, recollections or thoughts, memories etc, or involved in motor processes, or involved in emotional processes wither away.
And that is the survival of the fittest among collections of cells within the brain_ so that the brain is shaped by, uh, the continual uses of emotion, um, habits.
Um, constantly, um, or new signals from the environment that repeatedly stimulate, um, preexisting nuclei that are predisposed, um, to the sequence of events that comes with a certain experience.
And that the brain is therefore shaped, um, first of all by th- the tendency of given sections, uh, sets of cells to be predisposed a priori [Latin term] that is innately predisposed, to receiving a certain experience.
Um, and that, if that experience then comes about, in the, the subject's lifetime then those ce_ collection of cells or those nuclei are re-enforced.
And, that the- therefore they shape the architecture of the brain by already, having the code within them so to speak, the computer code already within them.
All they need is for the environment to press the metaphorical button.
This view of the brain, um, has been challenged on some other superficial levels, um, just on the basis of biologists unable to see, um, distinctive changes in neural architecture over the life_ of the lifetimes of, of, um, given patients of which they have studied.
Um, but this is yet to offer a very substantive, um, obstacle in the further development of ideas of the brain."
"The dissolution of the monasteries.
Um, fifteen thirty-five, fifteen forty.
This was carried out, by the second Tudor king.
The dynamic, and as the saying goes, controversial Henry VIII, after his break with Rome.
Ably assisted by his minister, Thomas Cromwell.
Not by the way, to be confused with his more famous, um, collateral descendent, Oliver Cromwell, who flourished over a hundred years later.
Um, the, dissolution of the monasteries, meant a drastic, brutal break, with nearly a thousand years, of, British history.
They were dissolved in both England and Wales.
There had been monasteries in England, since, about six hundred A-D.
Uh, monasteries in Wales for longer than that.
Um, so monasteries had been around, long before there ever was a Kingdom of England.
But Henry VIII, um, gets rid of them.
Gets rid of them, dissolves them, winds them all up, in four years.
Um, first of all we must ask, 'Why.
' Well, the official reasons, are a load of rubbish really.
Um, in fifteen thirty-five, Henry sends 'round corrupt, investigators, commissioners, to, investigate the morals, and general standards of behaviour of the monasteries.
And they come back, with a really sensational picture which makes ripping reading.
The sort of thing that people today like to r- read on Sundays...Raisin [modern-day British detective novel series].
That, um, that monks and nuns were up to all sorts of tricks.
Heterosexual and homosexual debauchery, drinking all the time, totally idle, um, and sometimes very corrupt.
Now, there were a few, cases like this.
Um, which you might expect.
Many monks and nuns took their vows of celibacy before they knew what they were doing.
Particularly as puberty was later, in those days.
And then they found that they'd given up the chance of a romantic or sex life, and they reneged on it.
Um, but, this wasn't that common.
Even homosexuality, when you get people of the same gender together, rather enclosed, you're liable to get some of that.
But in fact, it wasn't that common.
Um, drinking, well, everyone did quite a bit of drinking in those days.
So_ after all, beer and wine were healthier to drink than the water, very often.
Um, there were also cases of criminality, agreed.
Um, for example, at the time of the_ the commissioners were going around, the abbot of Whitland Abbey in Carmarthenshire, in Wales, was wanted for highway robbery in Oxfordshire.
And, another monk of Whitland was in, um, jail in Carmarthen, because he'd been forging coins in his, official cell, his monastic cell in Whitland.
But, again, this wasn't so usual.
Um, monks and nuns had probably lost their fervour, they weren't sticking to, um, their austere, regime, which most of their orders had laid down, of manual labour.
They weren't, um, praying, for their own souls, and for the souls of the laity enough.
One of their, main functions, that of producing illuminated manuscripts, one of the great glories or the English Middle A_ the Middle Ages, European Middle Ages, I'm sorry.
Had been taken away by the advent of printing.
So, although they were there, um, what, in a way, were they good for.
They were probably, um, the elite.
The abbots and priors and prioresses, were drawn from the country gentry and seemed to be woven very naturally into local, gentry society.
They um, dined, uh, in the manor houses.
Entertained their lay, equivalents who were often their relatives anyway.
They employed country gentry as stewards.
They, were involved in the endless law c- suits of the period.
Over_ over land and woods, which was, over the property of the monastery.
Um, so they were much the same of their social equivalents.
And ordinary monks and nuns were probably much the same, as, ordinary country people, in their outlook and morals.
But that's not good enough.
The whole point about monks and nuns is they should be better than, according to Catholic teaching, than ordinary people, sort of, spiritual Olympic athletes if you like.
The monasteries, uh, many of them_ there were poor houses, particularly the nun- nunneries.
But the main monasteries, were very wealthy.
They'd accumulated wealth over, hundreds of years.
So you could say, that you had a, a semi-useless body of people, um, not using the vast resources which they had.
That's a rather twentieth-century term.
Um, but that's not the way_ that's not really the way that Henry depicted them.
He needed much better excuses, there.
So, the sensational picture of debauchery was believed for hundreds of years, because Protestants wanted to believe it, but it's not true.
But Henry's real motive, I've already hinted at.
He wanted their wealth.
He was in debt, and he wanted, the wealth of the monasteries, which might have come to, almost a third of the total wealth of England.
Um, Henry, although he broke with Rome was not really a Protestant.
He was his own sort of Catholic.
He believed in the Catholic Church with himself as Pope, really.
His, um, chief minister, the man who did all the hard work, of taking over the monasteries, T- Thomas Cromwell.
However, although he had to tread carefully, served the king's, notion of grabbing the wealth of the monasteries.
But, Cromwell was also a secret Lutheran.
So with Thomas Cromwell, there was an ideological motive, for dissolution.
Because according to Lutheran teaching, you didn't need monasteries.
Luther himself was an ex-monk who gave up being a monk.
There was no purgatory, the Protestants taught, and monasteries prayed for the souls of people in purgatory.
Um, the archbishop, Thomas Cranmer, was also half Lutheran.
So, there were powerful Protestant forces 'round Henry.
Anyway, the monasteries were dissolved, in two bites.
In fifteen thirty-six, all the smaller monasteries.
Those, who, uh, were under, an income two hundred a year, on the grounds that they were the most immoral.
Whereas, the biggest monasteries thank_ in the bigger monasteries thanks be to God, true religion, is right well kept, and observed.
Rather odd that it's observed if you've got more than two hundred pounds a year, not otherwise.
In fact, it's because the king, A.
Couldn't absorb all the monasteries at once.
It was too much of an administrative task.
B.
Um, he didn't know, how attached people were to the monastic ideal, and, he wanted, to give people hope it was going on, if some monasteries remained.
Um, because, uh, he didn't want a general revolt on his hands.
In fact, he got one anyway.
The Pilgrimage of Grace, forty percent of England, um, the North, from the Scottish border down to Lincolnshire, revolted against the dissolution, among other grievances.
And, it was very dangerous in fifteen thirty-six, it could have toppled the monarchy, but Henry and his, um, ministers got on top of it, and that was the great revulsion against Henry's dissolution.
It's often been discounted, this dissolution, by historians, because they_ most British historians since have had a subtle, or unsubtle Protestant bias.
Be it happens up North, and um, most British historians tended to be_ had a southern, a London, or southern rath_ view of things, and what happens in Northern England is not terribly important.
That is a bias which has needed to be corrected.
But anyway, um, Henry got over that, and, he went slow on dissolving the rest.
But he dissolved them nevertheless in fifteen thirty_ d- in fifteen forty.
The last monastery to be dissolved was Christchurch Canterbury, uh, attached to the Cathedral in fifteen forty.
What were the results.
Well, first of all, immense spoils for the king, in land, treasure, and sheer money, coins.
Um, this had a trickle down effect.
Some of it was deliberately sold or granted, to bind people of Catholic persuasion, to the new settlement.
The Duke of Norfolk, who put down the Pilgrimage of Grace, was nevertheless a good Catholic.
But to make sure he didn't, revert to being a Roman Catholic, he was endowed with monastic lands.
A nobleman of Protestant inclination, where as well, like the ancestor of the great Russell family.
John Russell, First Earl of Bedford, not Earl of Bedford yet, was given monastic lands.
Woburn Abbey, which his family still have in Bedfordshire.
And monastic lands in the West Country.
But, many monastic lands were sold, and anyone who had money could do_ could buy them.
This led to a certain social rise, um, yeomen and merchants with money could become gentry, if they doubled their acreage.
Um, small gentry could become bigger gentry.
Bigger gentry could qualify for peerage status.
People around the king, not just the obvious courtiers, but the king's cook, and the king's barber, bought a lot of lands at favourable rates and set up as gentry.
So, there was a big, uh, rise like that.
It's probably from this time that we, date the rise of the gentry as the identifiable class, which lasts into the early twentieth century.
The squire, ceases to be dependent on the local great earl, and, becomes a rather independent little king of the local countryside.
Um, the marketed land, in fact, remains volatile, and there's plenty of land to buy, until about 1660, for various reasons.
If the monarchy had held onto all this land, it would probably been semi-absolute.
Um, not just in terms of wealth, but in terms of patronage.
Um, if it had held onto monastic estates, the gentry as previously would have to have been it's employees as stewards.
As they'd been employees, of, the abbots.
But, as it happens they were allowed to buy the estates which they previously managed.
A management buyout you might say.
As it happened, writing their own rules in the Soviets_ Soviet lands more recently.
Um, also patronage of livings, the, um, monasteries nominated priests to various parish livings.
Um, this often passed when land was sold by the king, to the local gentry.
So the king, although officially he had great control of the Church, in fact, at parish pump level passed it often to the local squire, which was short sighted.
But, anyway, um, it was partly because Cromwell fell.
The king executed him, not being very grateful, in 1540.
And then the king had to dissipate his lands.
On the cultural level, the um, dissolution was a disaster.
Um, the, buildings were left to decay.
Let's look at three great abbeys in the Thames Valley.
Reading, Abingdon, Oseney.
Go to Reading, you will see a f- few stones.
Go to Oseney near Oxford Rail Station, you will just about see a barn, which survives from those days.
Abingdon slightly more is surviving.
But nothing like the seven acres of buildings which were there, originally.
Um, so it was an architectural disaster.
Most of the buildings decayed.
The abbeys were gutted and sold off.
So, crucifixes, all sorts of works of art went, cart wood.
Um, even worse, medieval illuminated manuscripts rather sold for a song.
Or, recycled to be used for putting your washing bill on, or your local accounts on.
Um, some of them were recovered, but a lot of the- this_ these libraries of the middle ages, gone forever.
Um, it meant the Church much smaller.
A whole great limb of the Church was just cut off, and has never been there since.
Um, it was all done on the Lutheran Model in Saxony of ten years earlier.
And it was a powerfully negative blow in the Protestant direction, as Cromwell recognised.
The King didn't claim_ proclaim it as a Protestant policy.
But monasticism is associated with the Catholic Church.
And now monasticism has gone.
The Church becomes smaller.
Shown at the elite level, in the fact that the, bishops and mitred abbots, are equivalent to bishops, were a majority in the House of Lords, until the dissolution.
Now there were only the s- twenty-six bishops left, and they became an ever smaller minority, as the number of lay peers grew.
Um, it's... Something, which, has never been reversed.
Uh, the pilgrims of the North were defeated.
Queen Mary, had no time, in the Catholic Reaction in the fifteen fifties, to found the monasteries.
Since the eighteen fifties, the Roman Catholics have been allowed to have monasteries in this country.
And even the Anglicans, ha- have sometimes high Anglicans have sometimes imitated them.
But, it's not really the same thing, it's a marginal interest.    "
"Duties of M-Ps.
These are many and various.
Even ordinary backbenchers, that is, M-Ps without shadow, or real ministerial responsibilities, may work a fourteen-hour day.
Um, the duties, can be divided up into, var- various compartments.
Which is a useful working tool, as long as you remember it's also slightly artificial.
Because a given duty, is likely to overlap these departments.
Um, here i shall, confine myself, on this talk, to an M-Ps duty to his party.
Now M-Ps, are very much bound to their party.
Only one M-P today is an independent.
Martin Bell.
And, that is, in wholly exceptional circumstances.
He was elected.
All the other M-Ps are, party-bound, even if only to a minor party.
Say one of the Celtic nationalist parties.
And it's a relationship of mutual help.
M-P's party provides literature, clear policies, the help of all sorts of activists and enthusiasts, to get him elected, advice on policy, etcetera.
But in return they expect the loyalty of the M-P.
The stability, of, British government depends on the party system.
Uh, contrast the U-S-A, where the president is an elected monarch.
His party can't get rid of him, during the four years of his term.
And, he himself, on the other hand can distance himself from his party.
This also means that the U-S Congress, the broad equivalent of our, Parliament, is party, um, is not exactly parties-free.
But the role of disciplined parties is less there because it does not have to support an executive in power.
So congressmen can behave more independently, than our M-Ps.
Um, in Britain, individual M-Ps, um, follow the party line.
And, loyalty, involves, voting along the party line as the whips tell you to, on, um, divisions in the House of Commons.
Um, but, it involves more than that.
You must support the party in general, if you're an M-P, in times of crisis.
For example when the opposing party really attacks yours, you must rally to your party, even if you're normally considered to be a rebel.
Um, complimentarily, attacking the other party, is another way of uniting your party.
Especially if you're in opposition.
We saw this over the Westland Affair in nineteen eighty-six, which nearly toppled Mrs Thatcher.
Personal loyalty, is considered important also.
Especially by the leaders of the party.
Because it means loyalty to them.
Um, but, um, it's professed, by more junior members or backbenchers, if they want promotion or knighthood.
However, simple personal loyalty to the leadership, is not coterminous with loyalty to the party.
Though the party leaders naturally say it is.
In fact the two can clash.
Um, in November nineteen ninety, various people who said they were keen supporters of Mrs Thatcher, the prime minister, nevertheless, urged her to go, to resign.
As they said, unless she didn't, she would lose the next election, general election, and she would probably lose the lead_ next round of the leadership election.
She had been challenged by Mr  Heseltine for the leadership to the party.
And, they were successful.
Mrs Thatcher went.
Um, in nineteen eighty-three, the Labour leader Michael Foot had just lost an election disastrously.
Is the most disastrous feat_ defeat for a party of recent times, until the defeat of the Tory governing party in nineteen ninety-seven.
And he went very quickly.
I'd like to mention the role of the Nineteen Twenty-two Committee in the Tory Party.
That's a committee of all Conservative backbenchers.
Um, both prime ministers, and ministers, can be called to account, by the, Nineteen Twenty-two Committee, if the backbenchers don't like the way, um, Tory policy is going, or, at least they don't like the way, it's being carried out.
Um, and this happens quite often, if the party is not doing well in the polls.
The next display of loyalty has to be at general elections and by-elections.
M-Ps, have to swing behind their leaders then.
Otherwise they stand little chance of winning.
Voters spurn an obviously quarrelling party.
Excellent examples are the Labour Party in nineteen eighty-three, went down to disastrous defeat.
The Conservatives in nineteen ninety-seven, went down to, even more disastrous defeat, especially as they started off being the governing party.
And was redu_ were reduced to the smallest number of seats, a hundred and sixty four.
They'd held, um, for about ninety years.
Um, candidates in general need all the help they can get.
And they won't get it, if they're at odds with the party line.
Um, also, the voters will not vote for them if they think, the party's just quarrelling_ is not presenting a united front.
What about, um, eh, party duties in the constituency.
Um, all our M-Ps are constituency-linked.
They're personally elected for a certain geographical area.
Oxford East, where I am now, for example.
And M-Ps must promote the party interests in the constituency.
And, this involves various things.
They must explain policy to their local party committee.
And get um, worried local party members to, um, understand why the government, or, if it's the opposition party, is actually carrying out this policy.
But, they even support local politicians of their persuasion against the local opposition.
You can see here the attacks, good example of the two, then Conservative M-Ps for Oxford, on, the Labour Oxford City Council in the nineteen eighties.
Against the trend, Labour swept to power in Oxford in the early nineteen eighties, and indeed is still in power today.
Although it is no longer against the trend.
But the two M-Ps for the city, nineteen eighty-three, eighty-seven, were Conservative.
Patton and Norris.
And, they, conceived it as their duty to help support, the demoralised ramp, of the Oxford Conservative city counsellors, who'd been in control up to then, and couldn't understand why they'd lost, in an era of general, um, Conservative victory, in the national picture.
That begs the question, should august Westminster M-Ps concern themselves, in battles at the local level.
Uh, which is not their remit, and which are parish pump battles.
Aren't they just meddling.
But local counsellors and other actives, are going to be the most enthusiastic workers, to get an M-P, um, re-elected.
And they'll work best if the M-P helps them, in their hour of need.
So the relationship between, constituency local counsellors and other, party members and the M-P, is symbiotic.
Or if that word's too grand, it's the proverb, 'you scratch my back, and i'll scratch yours.'"
"The duties of M-Ps.
This is the second talk, in this theme.
Um, the duties, as I said, are divided, somewhat artificially into various compartments.
And this talk, will centre on constituency duties of M-Ps.
Um, there's a natural lead in from my previous talk about duty to party, because, I ended up talking about, the duty to party in constituencies in that talk.
So, you can see how much an overlap, there is.
Nevertheless, um, constituency duties of M-Ps, has it's own centre of gravity.
Um, I'll focus, on Oxfordshire largely.
For no better reason that I live here.
Or live there.
Oxfordshire is not typical of the country as a whole.
But nowhere is.
Whatever you take_ there isn't such a thing, as an absolutely typical bit of England.
And even that wouldn't be typical of Wales, or Scotland.
But, at least Oxfordshire is not untypical of the southern counties of England.
Um, its M-Ps are still mainly Tory, or Conservative, four out of six.
It's a largely rural constituency, with some suburbia.
It's got a display of, light industry and some high tech industry.
It hasn't got, mines and steel works, or shipyards.
Probably ex-mines and steelworks of the old industrial areas.
Now there are two, non-Tory M-Ps in Oxford itself.
A Labour man and a Liberal Democrat.
Um, what is untypical is that Oxford the county towns is a famous factor.
It's, far better known world-wide than Leicester, the county town of Leicestershire, because of Oxford's university.
It's also got, uh, at least one famous M-P in Mis_ in Mr Heseltine of Henley, the, former Tory deputy prime minister.
And who famously managed to, get Thatcher defeated, in nineteen ninety, in the premiership, uh, in the elections for leadership of the party.
Although, he didn't win himself in the end.
Um, while Andrew Smith, of Oxford East, where I'm sitting now, is less famous, but is now a junior cabinet minister, in Mr Blair's Labour government.
But, however well-known M-Ps are, even the most august M-P, must nurse their constituency.
Um, this applies to Mr Heseltine, and to Mr Herd, the former foreign secretary.
When he was up to nineteen ninety-seven M-P for Whitney in West Oxfordshire.
So, even Mr Herd, I've_ i, i, I've studied of them, hold constituency surgeries, where all constituents can come and pour out their troubles.
The metaphor is very much fro- from medicine, of course.
And if your troubles are within the scope of politics, the M-P will help you, say he will.
If you go to him and say, 'oh, I'm sorry, my girlfriend's left me and I'm lovelorn.
Um, what do you think I ought to do about it.
' He might well say, 'well, it happens to us all, it's not a political matter.
' Ha ha.
Um, nursing also involves, general, taking an interest, in local events.
Going to an opening, flower shows, agricultural shows, exhibitions of all sorts.
The more marginal, or electorally vulnerable you are, the better a constituency M-P you have to be.
Again, remember that co-operation with local activists, especially the councillors, um, shows the teamwork of local and national politics.
They both need each other.
All this, the nursing the constituency, is often convined, and I personally find this fascinating.
We're showing M-Ps as warm, human beings.
Fascinating, because it shows what is perceived to be, in the way M-Ps put their propaganda out, the ideal lifestyle of that time.
Whether it's the nineteen fifties, nineteen eighties, nineteen nineties.
As warm human beings then, sharing the lifetime and pleasures of the average person.
You have photos and films of them, casually dressed and relaxed with their happy families.
They will have their spouse there at least, and children if possible.
Although not all M-Ps have children and spouses.
Edward Heath, a bachelor, who was years ago, Tory prime minister, and before that party leader.
As a bachelor, he had, neither of those.
And, so he used to be photographed having picnics with other people's families.
Saying they were close friends of his.
Well, one Oxford M-P in the nineteen eighties, Steve Norris, um, did other things.
He went on a sponsored slimming, and a local charity benefited.
This shows, you know, what a regular guy he was.
He was worried about his weight, like lots of people.
And, um, later, however, Mr Norris was exposed as a womaniser of quite some energy.
He'd left Oxford by then.
And, to be exposed as a womaniser or, irregular habits, this is a minus mark.
Um, it was always thought that M-Ps should be human, but seemingly, at least, respectable.
Nevertheless, this may be less of a problem now, than it was, as late as, fourteen, fifteen years ago, say nineteen eighty-four.
Mr Norris is currently quite likely, to be the Conservative mayoral candidate for London.
And his disgraced predecessor in that role, very recently disgraced, Lord Archer, was selected in spite of his well-founded reputation as a rogue.
Um, if you look at Kensington and Chelsea, Alan Clark, the M-P who recently died, was famous for being a womaniser, and also seem to have broken the government's own rules for a Minister, about ten years ago, on arms exports.
Um, the new M-P for, Kensington and Chelsea, is Michael Portilo, who has confessed to a rather long period of homosexual activity in his youth.
But that hasn't ha- stopped him getting back into Parliament.
Um, while, in Portilo's former constituency Enfield, he was defeated, in, nineteen ninety-seven, by a man Steven Twig, who was always openly and invalidly homosexual.
Steven Twig is a Labour, member.
Um, now, the point about that, is that, in my own experience, um, well, well let's rephrase that.
From my own observation, ha ha, um, homosexuality would have_ be, a death mark, I think as late as the early nineteen eighties.
If an M-P came out, or a candidate came out, and said he was homosexual.
Both of the Labour, and, Tory parties, he might still be the candidate, but he'd have been defeated.
Um, overt womanising, probably also, until very recently.
But now it doesn't seem to matter.
So, perhaps what constitutes a warm and respectable human being, has changed, even over the past, fourteen, fifteen years.
Um, the local papers, T-V and radio, all the media, will publicise, news about M-Ps, usually, blandly and favourably.
Um, they can't afford to offend anyone in their limited readership pool.
While a national newspaper may be, stridently Tory, Labour, or Lib-Dem, well I don't know any, stridently Lib-Dems, but in principle.
Um, a local paper can't be, because it's only got a certain number of readers.
It doesn't want to offend, say thirty or forty percent of them, who are Tories, by being aggressively Labour, or vice versa.
So they just like, to write up anyone, who's moderately locally famous.
And M-Ps are obviously like that.
Um, they don't usually pose, awkward questions, um, to Tor_ for instance, Tory MPs may praise local state schools.
But usually, Tory M-Ps, don't send their own children to state schools, but in the independent sector.
The local reporter's not going to come along and say, 'Well, if Stanford Primary School is so good, why isn't your daughter who is aged eight there.
' Although John Patton, later Tory education minister, in fact did send his young daughter in the eighties to a local primary school.
Um, we must also, look at special interests in the constituency.
Um, special interests are not the specific concern_ personal concern of any individual.
But, they are, general things, usually economic interests.
If a particular type of agriculture or industry predominates in a constituency, M-Ps must speak up for that.
Some M-Ps have been speaking up, for farmers, in the beef re_ present beef crisis.
But in the nineteen eighties Andrew Smith, not then a cabinet minister of course, a young opposition M-P, was fighting for the Cowley car workers in Oxford East.
When it was thought the car works, which had been reduced in size, might be, closed entirely by their new owners, Nissan.
They haven't been, so he claims a success.
That is a special interest.
A constituency's personal problems_ constituent's personal problems not a special interest.
Neither are roads, houses, or hospitals, because, they're the same everywhere, you need them all over the country.
A hospital is a special interest in_ from the point of view of it's employe_ employees.
You know, Headington in Oxford East is, many people are employed in the hospital system.
It's not a special interest from the point of view of the constituents.
Um, of course, there's an element of humbug, in displayed M-Ps, as the man or woman in the street.
Um, practically all M-Ps, are richer, better educated, more ruthless, more energetic, and more ambitious, um, than, their average constituent.
Um, and, at one time, this was often built up.
M-Ps or ministers were supposed to be rather, um, remote, maybe, elitist figures.
Um, this would have been, the posture in their different ways of Mr  Gladstone and Churchill.
Two rather different people.
But now this deference factor has gone.
M-Ps, even the prime minister, Tony Blair, have to be, or appear, what, um, the Americans would call a regular guy, or a regular gal.
I.
E.
Terribly normal.
Um, and that's the way, um, modern day electors, seem to like it.
It's, um, aligns with the fact that, the old social class structure or the deference structure, has, broken down.
But, in fact, um, don't be fooled.
There are still_ M-Ps are still very ambitious, and they're usually, in fact, um, much richer, than the rest of us."
"The duties of M-Ps.
The third in my talks on this, will concentrate on M-P's duty to the nation as a whole.
Um, an M-P, for instance, may think his party line, is short-sighted, looked at in the broader national interests, and may want to disagree with his party line, or with his constituents, for that reason.
Um, so, duty to the nation can clash, with what is usually considered the overriding duty to party.
Now duty to nation, sounds noble.
Um, but, the reality is muddier.
Um, party, um, party constituent and personal interest, are often presented, as if they were a duty to the nation.
Um, presented in those terMs  for instance the redundancies of workers in heavy industry, in the nineteen eighties.
Labour said, it was a national scandal, that it was happening.
The Tories said, that industrial workers who were put out of work, were a necessary sacrifice, because you had to modernise old rust-belt industries.
They both claimed a higher purpose in their stance, the contradictory ones.
Um, I don't think we need go as far, however, as Dr Johnson, the eighteenth century, literary figure, who said, 'patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
' Ha ha.
That's too harsh.
Another example of duty to nation, or, as an M-P might honestly see it, um, could be in the revolts against the party line.
This is particularly interesting when government backbenchers do it.
You might say that opposition backbenchers, um, have more freedom, and indeed almost a duty to be revolting.
At least in the first part of the Parliament.
While they're trying to sort out_ their party's trying to sort out, how they can, um, best present themselves to the electorates.
It's usually an internal debate.
And anyway their party leaders don't have the authority of prime minister.
After all, the party leader of the opposition, has either, just lost, or hasn't yet won an election.
The party leader of, the Tory Party, at the moment, young Mr Hague, hasn't won an election.
Um, now revolts, by government backbenchers were very common under the Tories, from nineteen seventy-nine to ninety-seven.
And even under Blair, Labour backbenchers, revolted against, measures to cut Social Security to single mothers.
And so force them out to work.
Sometimes, in the eighties, and quite often in the nineties, the Tory governments were defeated in the house, by revolts of their own backbenchers.
Or to be more precise, a certain number of backbenchers, either voted with the opposition or abstaining.
There's no other way the conservatives could be, um, defeated, until at least ninety-two.
Because, if all their backbenchers voted for them, their majorities easily outnumbered all the opposition parties combined.
Such a defeat hasn't happened yet, under Labour, since May ninety-seven.
But who knows.
So backbench revolts can be effective.
Sometimes they revolt on principle.
Sometimes for more direct electoral reasons, if they think that government policy is going to cause them to lose their seats.
Um, Conservative revolts against the famous Poll Tax, or, Community Charge in nineteen ninety is a good example of that.
They thought their government was pressing ahead with a measure, which would just, cause the Conservative Party to be defeated in the next election.
Um, in nineteen ninety then, Tory M-Ps took the side of their local Tory-controlled councils against the Poll Tax, um, in opposition to the prime minister, Mrs Thatcher.
When there is a big majority for the government.
E.
G.
The Conservatives ninety eighty-three, ninety-two, and Labour from May ninety-seven to the present.
Affective opposition, it is paradoxically argued, can only come from the ranks of its own backbenchers.
The government will listen to them, because they dep_ the government depends on them for their majority.
Um, and the backbenchers will defend at least the interests of the people, who vote for the government party, and so have put it in power.
And whose support, must be retained at the next general election.
The official opposition, by contrast, is usually a, a demoralised rump, even a rabble.
Um, you could say Labour was like that, between, nineteen seventy-nine, until some point, at least nineteen eighty-six, a lot of the time.
And the Tories are, very much like that now.
And, the hardcore vo- voters of the opposition parties, which is what a badly defeated opposition is left with, are people who wo- wouldn't vote for the governing party anyway.
So why should the governing party listen to the opposition.
Interestingly though, smaller opposition parties, are sometimes listened to more than the official opposition.
Because, they are sometimes conceived as sort of direct rivals, um, to the conserv_ uh, to the governing party.
The alliance, in the mid nineteen eighties, for example, was, feared by the con_ then Conservative government, more than the Labour opposition was.
But anyway, the votes of all opposition M-Ps combined, cannot bring down a government with a big majority.
But if some government rebels combine with the opposition, the government can be defeated.
Um, in fact, this can also be done if government M-Ps simply abstain.
As a result, the government often makes quiet, unpublicised, policy concessions, to its own backbenchers.
Um, another duty to the nation, which is also unpublicised, a lot of M-Ps' work in Parliament can often be co-operative, and essentially non-party.
Um, M-Ps, can often agree on certain measures.
I.
E.
To better protect the countryside.
Um, and M-Ps also, have to help Parliament do its job, by simply playing the game, and taking part in debates, and obeying the rules of debate.
These activities, per se, are not publicised much, because the media likes bloody, and hysterical, and noisy clashes.
You know, it makes for exciting reading or television.
A look, finally, at the national interest in relation to the, constituency interest.
If there's a clash, M-Ps can side either, um, with or against, their constituents, or their party leadership, via co- conviction or career hopes.
Um, from their leader they could get patronage, jobs.
Also, however, an M-P is a representative, not a delegate, as the eighteenth century thinker Burke said.
That means he's not just a ventriloquist dummy, for what his constituents think.
Indeed Burke said that, and M-P is a professional politician, therefore, you're electing him to use his judgement.
Just as you might, um_ uh, as shareholders might elect a managing director to use his judgement in business.
Or you go to, a doctor, or a lawyer.
It's a bit like that.
Um, s- nor is an M-P a glorified local councillor, he should really spend more time dealing with national than local issues.
Although in practice there has to be a compromise.
Um, nevertheless, M-Ps, are selected, and may be deselected, by their local party committees.
An M-P who offends his local party too much, is likely to be deselected.
So, there is a, um, balance to be maintained there."
"In the fourth of these, talks on duties of M-Ps, I'd like to look at, duty to self.
The whiff of independence, um, in duty to nation, perhaps leads onto this.
M-Ps, must have some time, for this.
Otherwise why elect a territorially bound M-P at all.
An actual person elected for Oxford East, say.
Rather than just a faceless nominee from a party list, jobbed in on a national basis, on vote percentage.
There has always been this ancient link with a particular piece of territory.
So an M-P represents_ a particular M-P represents particular people.
Now private member's bills, are the most obvious way to promote a private interest.
Private member's bills, um, are bills introduced by the M-Ps themselves.
It's a fairly self-explanatory title, not backed by the governing party.
Um, there're bills against hunting, um, fox hunting in this country, or hare hunting.
Cutting down abortion rights.
In, um, the nineteen, uh, sixties, some rather important things were done, by private member's bills, or they paved the way.
Sidney Silverman, introduced a private member's bill to abolish the death penalty.
Um, it didn't get through, but there was sufficient support for the then home secretary to take note and introduce a government bill.
So the pri_ to do the same thing.
So private member's bill was, a pathfinder.
Similarly, um, a private member's bill, which did get through, was, um, introduced by the young Liberal M-P, David Steele, later, leader of the Liberal Party, to legalise abortion, in certain circumstances.
The governing party didn't want to touch this, because it thought it might offend antiabortionists.
But it didn't oppose it either, and it got through.
Backbenchers, um, may also take an interest in, foreign policy.
Which is usually, totally unconnected for their constituency work, unless it's a trade dimension.
Again in the nineteen eighties, Steven Norris visited the Palestinian liberation front.
He went from exotic East Oxford to the Middle East.
I can't think that it had much to do with his constituency work.
Um, Norris, was also against fox hunting.
Which i_ um, not a usual Tory stance.
Most Shire Tories as we call them, either tend to be for fox hunting, or can't speak out against it, because the chairman of the local hunt, and the chairman of the local constituency party, has a nasty habit of being the same person.
Nowadays, Ann Widdecombe, the remarkable Ann Widdecombe, is against fox hunting, and is a Tory front bencher.
Um, perhaps, the Tory Party's changing, um, or perhaps, it's quite possible, they're just being personally sincere.
Um, against the, um, sporting interests of rather a lot of Tories.
Um, if by the way, a Labour member says he's against fox hunting, he might be quite sincere, but he might not be at all.
Because it's official party policy or, generally approved of to be against fox hunting.
Um, there is however, another less idealistic side, of duty to self.
Um, in, recent years, far too many M-Ps have become consultants for financial interests of all sorts.
Not in itself necessarily corrupt.
But it has led to great corruption and sleaze.
There were so many scandals in the Tory years to nineteen ninety-seven.
Um, of which, the most notorious was Neil Hamilton.
Who took bribes from the owner of Harrods, um, Al Fayed to try and get him ci- British citizenship.
Al Fayed is looked upon as a dubious character, and neither the Tory_ former Tory government or the present Labour government would give him citizenship.
So, he used to bribe Neil Hamilton to try and get him, the citizenship.
Now, consultancies and the business interests of M-Ps, can be honest and registered.
Um, um, uh, sometimes M-Ps, have businesses or farms or estates before they come into Parliament.
Um, or, or M-Ps of course have to have a job before they're in Parliament.
So, they could be, a practising lawyer, say, before they get in, and continue to practice law when_ once they're in.
Or, they could be journalists.
So, it isn't bad in itself, and there's also very respectable argument, that M-Ps shouldn't be a, a sort of ivory tower lot, like academics, who have no experience, of the world of work, or of ordinary life.
So that they're not meant to be total specialists.
Total professional politicians.
That they should be a body of men and women who are drawn from various walks of life for the workaday world.
Um, yes, all those are respectable arguments.
But there's a difference between, always working in the family firm say, and, um, taking up a consultancy for, an interest like that tobacco industry, you've never had any concern with before.
P'raps you're a non-smoker, as soon as you become an M-P, because the tobacco industry wants a tie to you.
And, even regulation, and the registration, of interest doesn't ensure honesty.
The fact that someone knows that you're a consultant for the tobacco industry, doesn't necessarily mean that, the way you do your consultancy's going to be honest.
Um, and there's a more subtle danger.
The danger that M-Ps, will cease, to represent the voters interests, in any of the above senses, and become glorified lobbil_ lobbyists.
There can be corruption of spirit and motive, which the law can't legislate f- from.
Um, even when M-Ps are staying in the letter of the law, such spiritual corruption can be subtle.
Um, but this can counteracted, by more active voting public.
Politics is in the end, too important to be left to M-Ps.
Voters who do are lazy and complacent, and that's most of us.
Um, and, we may in a way deserve corrupt or at least self-seeking M-Ps.
It's my job, and your job to put pressure on them, and to keep them up to the mark."
"The early Tudor elite.
The nobility and gentry, fourteen fifty, fifteen thirty.
Perhaps I should explain, that the Tudors, were the society that ruled England, Wales, and Ireland, from fourteen eighty-five to sixteen oh three.
They're of Welsh origin.
The most famous Tudors, are Henry VIII, with his six wives, and his break with Rome.
And, his daughter Queen Elizabeth, the last Tudor.
But I'm not going to talk about the monarchs as such.
I'm going to talk about, the people immediately under them.
The elite, the nobility and gentry.
Nowadays, people are either embarrassed to talk about the traditional landed hierarchy.
Feeling they will be accused of snobbery.
Or they're frivolous about it.
Whether in the debunking way, making fun of, the aristocracy.
Or, in a sort of, snobbishly, social climbing sense.
They name drop.
We name drop, that we, know the Earl of So-and-So.
Um, but, the landowning class is not taken that seriously.
Even though it's richer than it pretends to be.
However, for most of history, it was basically, a very important reality.
A fact of life.
The landowners were the most powerful people in England.
In fact, I would say, sweepingly, they're the most powerful people over most of Europe and Asia, in their various guises.
To take a society totally remote from ours, what about the Samurai of Japan, in old Japan.
Um, so, but I can't talk about the whole world, or half the world.
So, I will focus, much more narrowly on the, elite of early Tudor England.
Well, it was a stratiford_ stratified society.
There was none of the, sometimes slightly, um, hypocritical moves to, verbal equality, social equality we have nowadays.
In fact, it was considered society should be the absolute opposite.
A triangle, with a very broad base and a very narrow apex.
With the king at the very apex.
And the nobles and gentry and higher clergy just underneath.
This fact was illustrated by the Sumptuary Laws.
Which were usually broken anyway.
But, which laid down that, each category of, um, uh, each social category should wear, certain sorts of clothes.
Very rich and elaborate for the nobles, and gradually getting soberer and soberer.
But people didn't obey these laws.
Nevertheless, these laws were there.
Can you imagine people laying that down today.
Um, let's look at the subdivisions of the elite.
The Baronage, or what we would call the Peers, were an elite of elites.
Even so, um, they had their own divisions, from dukes to ordinary barons.
In fact, one baron, Lord Clifford, accused his son of behaving like a duke's son, rather than a poor baron's son.
It's rather odd for a baron to think of himself as humble.
But I suppose compared with a duke or king, he was.
They_ they were around sixty families.
Remaining re- remarkably constant in number through the period.
Although different families.
Obviously, some died out, and were replaced.
They had many privileges.
Um, they had their own house of Parliament, which they retained until a, week or so ago, at the time I'm speaking.
In fact, when Mr  Blair's just abolished the right of hereditary peers.
Even so, not all of them.
They also have the dubious privilege, which they're probably glad is gone, of being beheaded, rather than hung or burned, if they were accused of treason.
They could only be tried for a crime by their peers.
They had great social respect.
Um... And, of course, in the pract_ theory at least, they had great wealth.
Then there were the gentry.
They were themselves divided into knights, who were called 'Sir'.
Although they didn't inherit it.
'Esquire', which came after your name, just below the knights.
Um, both these, um, categories had coats of arms, which were often forged by the heralds.
You bribed the herald to, forge you a court of arms_ coat of arms, which claimed_ whereby you claimed you came over with William the Norman five hundred years before.
Even though, you were a new knight, and your grandfather had made all the money.
Then there were the plain gentry.
There was_ unlike in France, there was no legal definition of plain gentry.
You were a gentleman, if, people accepted you as a gentleman.
It was rather circular.
It depended on maintaining a gentle way of life.
Being more elaborate and extravagant than the yeoman or a merchant, who is just underneath.
That brings us to lifestyle.
A gentleman, was supposed to have superfluous servants.
Unlike, uh, a middle class man, a yeoman or a merchant, who would only employ the servants he needed.
Um, gentleman had servants hanging around, who were often not doing very much.
But, they were in his uniform or livery.
And he had to live in a house, which was recognisably a manor house.
Rather than simply, a large farm house.
Although the distinction was a bit vague.
And, he had to keep open house and hospitality, and to entertain a lot of hangers on.
And was supposed to entertain the poor.
Which partially explains, this need to keep up the lifestyle, partly explains why, earls, the top of the elite, who, had incomes of between three and four thousand a year.
Which is equivalent of an income of a million a year now, or more, were often, in debt, were often bankrupt.
Haha, they were forced to spend money, or said they were.
Um, specific aspects of this lifestyle, diet and clothes.
Meat, especially game, and wine, were the keynotes, of, um, elite consumption.
Um, meat, they went round hunting it for themselves.
It was part of another part of being noble, or gentle.
You hunted the boar and the deer.
They also had extraordinary variety of things.
Swans, for example.
Um, as for the wine, until very recently wine in England has been a keynote of riches, or distinction, because it's very difficult to produce it here.
So they imported and drank a lot of wine from France, Claret.
It wasn't a very healthy diet.
It led to gout and obesity.
Especially as you not only had to eat these things.
But you were supposed to eat them in great quantity.
Feasting, an idea, inherited from Anglo Saxon times, from very early times.
You held elaborate feasts in your hall, and stuffed yourself.
You can see that best with the portrait Henry VIII, after all, the king was only in the way the biggest noble, how fat he got.
Henry VIII had a slim suit of armour in fifteen thirteen, when he was young.
By fifteen forty-three, his suit of armour was huge, and you can see that in the Armoury Museum in the Tower of London.
Um, vegetables and fruit were not enough in evidence, and milk products were despised as peasant fare.
So it was rather unhealthy.
Clothes were rich, and imported fabrics.
See the sumptuary laws, silk, slashed, gorgeous ruffs, everything.
Livery and maintenance now, good lordship.
What does that mean.
Private armies, and clientage really.
Um, all these superfluous servants were not just there for show.
In the disturbed conditions, civil wars of fifteenth century England.
The Wars of the Roses, they formed private armies.
Um, they were all_ this was called 'bastard feudalism' paying people to, back you up.
So many nobles were sort of aristocratic gangsters.
Like the Duke of Norfolk of the fourteen seventies.
Who went round with a gang of thugs, frightening people.
There were other forms of clientage, of course.
Judges were often bought, and juries.
So they'd bring in verdicts, according to their, um, patron's wishes.
Rather like in, uh, a western, of the American west.
There were some similarities.
Priests often easily forgave sins, if they were in the lord's service.
The lord confessed to them, and they gave them an easy penance, and so on.
Lawyers would find forms of words, whereby their lord had the incontrovertible right to a piece of land, rather than a rival, or a poorer person.
This brings us to sources of income.
Land, especially, in various forms of rents.
Also the profits of plunder of war.
Very common up to fifteen thirty.
At first at home, and then after the Tudors established internal peace, abroad.
Extortion indeed, until the Tudors, a stronger monarchy started to deal with it.
Extorting money out of more defenceless people.
Then, pensions from the Royal Court.
You tried to get a pension or an office from the Royal Court.
Where you hoped for a minimum of work, and a maximum of income.
And, perhaps payments for genuine services.
Uh, minor gentry often worked for the earls as stewards, or administrators, or lawyers.
Not all gentry relied on their land.
Um, now some of the above, are a degeneration, corruption, of two quite legitimate activities.
The military activity, leading the king's armies, which was the gentry, or the nobles, were supposed to do.
Or officers in them, if they were gentry.
And the landholding.
The trouble was, in the fifteenth century, in the Wars of the Roses, nobles often commanded armies against the king of the day.
The Tudors, however, put a firm stop to that.
And, they also tried to make landholding landowners obey the law, rather than going for extortion.
Leisure, we've dealt with that a bit.
Hunting and hawking, jousting, which was a ritualised form of the nobles' military function.
Feasting, and minstrels, people singing to you.
You've probably all seen them, in idealised films of the court of King Arthur.
Which has nothing to do with King Arthur.
Who would have existed at all around five hundred A-D, but, is a high medieval view of how a king should behave.
Education.
The nobles, uh, especially the, the, the, um, boys, got a reasonable basic education.
They'd be taught some French and Latin, simple arithmetic, and history, a bit of law.
Um, at the age of twelve, they often went away to be pages, in the house of another great noble.
Or, if their father was a gentry, uh, a simple gentleman, he'd try and get them accepted as pages, into the house of a local great earl.
This died out by the fifteen eighties, which was going strong in our period.
So, pages, you've probably seen in romantic views of the middle ages, actually existed.
Universities up to fifteen thirty, um, not many nobles, uh, went to university.
And relatively few gentry.
They were still regarded as for, pe_ men of humble origin wanting to make their way through the church.
But some gentry wanted to go into the church, had to go to university.
Younger sons, and nobles.
Um, also some went to the Inns of Court.
Which were sort of a third university in England, and picked up some law.
Also had a lot of fun, and, um, picked up some social graces.
So, gentry and nobles would need to know some law.
Um, so all together, um, it was a good life if you could get it.
Which is_ um, explains why people tried to get into the gentry.
How were they recruited.
Well plain gentry, sometimes from younger sons of gentry themselves, who, um, made enough money as merchants to buy an estate.
Sometimes, from merchants and yeomen, that's wealthy farmers, who got_ or lawyers, who got enough money to climb into the gentry.
The aristocracy, the titled people, were recruited from the gentry.
To jump up, from say, being a middle class merchant, to being a baron, let alone an earl, was unheard of that period.
But, although the theory was that people didn't rise and fall on the social scale.
Of course they did.
And everyone, as now, was trying to scrabble up to get a bit higher in the social scale.
And, a measure of success was if, you ceased to be regarded as a merchant or yeoman, and, were regarded as a gentleman.
Then the sky was the limit.
Maybe in two ge_ two generations' time, you'd become an earl.
A very good example of that is the Spencer families, from whom the ill-fated Princess_ Diana Princess of Wales comes.
Who around fifteen hundred were wealthy sheep farmers, and were earls after sixteen hundred, and gentry in the meantime."
"The outbreak, of, the Civil War in Britain, sixteen thirty-eight, sixteen forty-two.
In sixteen twenty-nine, young King Charles I, decided to rule without parliament, which in his first four years, had caused him a lot of probleMs  he just couldn't get on with them.
So you get the eleven years of Charles's personal rule.
Which gradually broke down.
One after another the three kingdoms, Scotland, England, Ireland go into revolt.
Why.
Um, the Whigs.
The Whig Theory of Sc_ School of History, in the nineteenth century, used to call, these eleven p_ years' personal rule, the 'eleven years' tyranny'.
Which one might say is a loaded, um, way of describing it.
In fact, was it so tyrannical.
Largely no.
You could argue that, Charles I, in the sixteen thirties, was, far and away less blood-thirsty and tyrannical, than Henry VIII, in the fifteen thirties.
It was also the case, however, that a more sophisticated, and literate ruling elite, um, were less ready to put up, um, with, not being consulted.
Having no parliament to speak through, than their great-grandfathers had been in the time of Henry VIII.
So it's not so much the quality, or, terrible quality of Charles's rule.
But, the way, it was perceived.
The changing values of the time.
After all, kings had ruled without parliament, for long periods before.
Um, in the reign of the_ Charles's father, James I, between sixteen ten and sixteen twenty-one, there's only one parliament.
The Addled Parliament of sixteen fourteen, and as it's name implies, or it's nickname implies, that was rather abortive, and spent three weeks doing not very much before the exasperated king dissolved it.
Um, ruling without parliament was not unconstitutional.
There was nothing, in the English constitution  said the king, had to call parliament.
Um, he called it if wanted to.
Um, also, it's_ ruling without parliament is purely negative.
It's not necessarily a positive program.
But some historians have seen a rather feeble, and halt in progress to absolutism.
Continental-style absolutism, in the sixteen thirties.
Um, but feeble and halting, because Charles should have built up a standing army if he wanted to be a real absolutist monarch.
And a civil service.
Um, professional civil service.
Perhaps he would have done if he'd had time.
Um, but things collapsed, before he could get round to it.
We don't know.
What he did try and build up with the famous ship money.
The tax taken without parliamentary, authorisation, was a navy.
Which of course, it's not much use, to have land-based royal absolutism.
Um, so then, the factors which led to this great revolt, from fifteen thirty-eight, are many and various.
Scotland, was the first to go.
And here religion, is, very much the factor.
Um, Charles, and Lord, with supreme statesmanship intact, decide to introduce the Anglican Church, into Scotland.
Decide to make the official Scottish Calvinist Kerk, um, Anglican, if you like, and high Anglican at that.
It's a national revulsion, ensues.
Which is the stuff of Scottish folklore, which I won't go into now.
Jenny Geddes, the kalewife, hurling a stool at the, um, in St.
Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, at the head of the officiating, pro-Anglican dean.
Anyway, the Scottish nobles and gentry signed the covenant.
Which says that they were not part, before Charles caves in, and restores_ recognises their own Calvinist Kerk, and they invade England.
That in itself, forces Charles, eventually, to call parliament.
The short parliament, sixteen forty, to get money to fight the Scots.
But the_ Pym and Saye and Sele, who dominate the short parliament, are in league with the Scots, and say they will not vote Charles any money before he, dismembers his personal rule regime.
Um, the English are annoyed about religion, the nor_ the Lordian innovations.
They're annoyed about arbitrary taxation like ship money.
And, above all, they want a parliament.
They want representative institutions.
So they, the English nobility and gentry can share power with the, um, king.
What about the Irish Revolt of sixteen forty-one.
If you want the cause of the Irish Revolt, um, to do them properly, I'll be here for a very long time.
So I'll cut them.
Just about every issue conceivable in Ireland.
Ireland is the only one of the three kingdoms which is under colonial rule.
A foreign English, and to some degree Scottish elite, is imposing an alien culture, an alien language, and an alien religion, on the native Irish.
Remember, at this time, the Irish are overwhelmingly Gaelic-speaking.
They have their own language, and they're overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.
Um, also the ratio population of Ireland, to England, is much higher than today.
Uh, Ireland has about sixty percent of the population of England.
These days I would say it's got, um, more like eight percent the population.
So, a load of revolting Irish on your doorstep, is very alarming.
Particularly as they're Catholic, and there's a mutual racist hatred between the English, and the Irish.
Which let us hope, is not true today.
The fulcrum, however, of the whole Civil War explosion is usually England.
The revolts in the two Celtic countries, gave the English their chance.
The king had to recall Parliament, to get tax, to pay for the Scottish Revolt.
And, by the way, he did not get this tax.
Then in sixteen forty-one, the Irish Revolt of alien papists, from the English point of view, weakened him still further.
And also alarmed Parliament.
Um, though, a mixture of the, fear of the Irish Revolt, and the king's wish to exploit the situation, destroyed the constitutional compromise, which Parliament had forced on the king in sixteen forty-one.
If that had held, there might not have been a Civil War.
The result is well-known.
The Civil War, and eventual execution of the king, in sixteen forty-nine.
The monarchy was restored in sixteen sixty in the shape of Charles II, son of Charles I.
But was never the same again.
Um, absolutism, could never be seriously on the cards again.
The brief threatening of it in the sixteen eighties was more apparent than real, as a revolution_ revolution of sixteen eighty-eight showed.
What general explanations, then, can we give for the Civil War.
I'd say you have to avoid general explanations in one way.
And go into a lot of detail, which we can't do here.
But some which have been advanced, religion, and constitutional issues, those are the nineteenth century Whig School of History.
There's a lot in that.
Three, the Marxist idea, a bourgeois revolution against, what they awkwardly name, the feudal-absolutist monarchy.
I think that's more outdated.
That's an idea of the nineteen thirties to fifties.
Personally I think it's a more outdated organising principle, than the nineteenth century Whig theory.
And how, the_ the very awkwardness, of, that Charles's Monarchy was feudal-absolutist, um, shows that the theory is a bit cumbersome.
Three, um, one which is more recent, is that the Civil War, was a split in the elite.
A split in the nobility and gentry.
After all, um, the parliamentary side, contains, some real, real raving left-wing radicals, like the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Manchester, the Earl of Pembroke.
Uh, the Earl of Bedford, and even the Earl of Salisbury.
The son of the minister of Elizabeth and James.
It's very hard to make out that, uh, the parliamentarians were the underdogs, while the royalists were the possessors.
It's a split in the elite.
Who_ wha- really want to restore, what they imagined was the constitutional balance of the time of Elizabeth.
In fact, um, what they want to restore is not the constitutional balance of the time of Elizabeth.
But, they think it is.
Um, and_ but once the elite is split, of course, as the years go on_ the sixteen forties go on, far more radical forces, emerge.
Cromwell, and his Ironsides, are one example.
But then, by sixteen forty-seven, you get the levellers and the diggers, who are too radical for Cromwell.
And the various lunatic, half-political, half-religious sects of the late sixteen forties.
So, as Shakespeare said, 'take but degree away; untune that string.
And lo.
What discord follows.
' Or to put it more crudely, if you open the box, you don't know what's going to fly out."
"The growth and special role of London, fifteen hundred, to seventeen hundred.
Um, London, in those days, um, towered over, any other British city, more than it does today.
Although of course, it's still pretty impressive.
Uh, we think of the Scottish poet Barbour [he means Dunbar], and Scotland had, um, n- no such great city to speak of.
Even Edinburgh was tiny, the capital, in those days.
Say, write a poem where he says, 'London, thou art the flour of Cities all.
' And there's something to be said for that.
Although things weren't always so fragrant, if you went to a London street in fifteen hundred.
You'd probably find it more smelly than fragrant.
But anyway, all through this period, there was great economic and population expansion.
London spills far beyond the boundaries of the city.
There's always a stream of poor immigrants from the country.
Um, I would say, that in fifteen hundred, London already had seventy thousand people.
Which wasn't_ uh, doesn't sound much by our standards, but it was huge by the standards of England.
Remember that England probably had at most, three hundred_ three and a half million people, in the whole of England.
Um, London, as it was, the only major urban centre, also had, um, certain, inflexes, um, uh, ways of behaving, which, just didn't occur.
You could almost say just couldn't occur, um, in any other part of England or Wales or, Scotland come to that.
The poor for example, there were poor everywhere.
But there were tens and thousands of poor in London.
They formed a mob.
In a way which could hardly be replicated in Norwich, the next biggest city, which only had twenty thousand people, rich or poor.
And the poor where their bad conditions in London.
Helped make London notorious for popular unrest in the sixteenth century, and for for political radicalism in the, seventeenth.
The economy.
Industry moves to the suburbs in London, away from the city, of London, the city of Westminster, where it could be regulated by the guilds.
Um, cloth working, printing, later on, all sorts of things.
Um, labour was cheaper because, um, in the suburbs, uh, labour wasn't s- subject to the wage rates of the city of London.
So, uh, the economy then helps the ci_ London to grow_ to grow more suburbs.
Um, commerce and finance is an element of this.
In the sixteenth century, you get the joint stock companies, from fifteen fifty to explore, and finance trading to remote parts of the world.
You get the, East India Company, in some ways the culmination of sixteen hundred.
And, the seventeenth century is, the time, of immense expansion of, English overseas trade.
Far beyond, the usual cloth trade with northern Europe.
And, this lays the foundation of the wealth of England and indeed the later British Empire.
By the sixteen nineties, from sixteen ninety-four, you've got the Bank of England in the city of London.
Which has been there ever since.
Um, so London, from the sixteen seventies I would say, is a great national and finance and trade centre.
Even an international centre, by, the end of the seventeenth century.
Um, and it has never ceased to be an international centre for finance and trade.
Um, the old magistrates of the city, in terms of government, were however losing control of this new expansion.
And there was, little authority in the suburbs, of any sort.
They were nominally part of the county of Middlesex.
Um, in the Civil War period, um, to turn to politics.
Sixteen forty, sixteen sixty, the city was forced to loan money to Parliament.
And this might have been_ certainly was I think, a factor in, the reason why Parliament won over the king.
The king left London in early sixteen forty-two, over which he had lost all control.
Because the mobs, were sided with Parliament.
And, uh, therefore he, could no longer tap into the resources, when the war came, uh, to fight, of the city of London.
The city merchants, lent to Parliament.
Partly by ideological conviction, partly it was, by prudence.
They couldn't do anything else, Parliament was in control.
And the, city of London merchants were the greatest concentration of financial wealth, by far, anywhere in the kingdom.
Um, this extortion, however, by the government, continued post sixteen sixty, under the restored monarchy.
They'd learnt a few things.
Radical politics.
Only London, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was big enough to foster radicalism.
Which was more than the sort of, spasmodic discontent to Saturday Night Riot which was put down.
Um, you have, first of all, London's internal politics.
I've said, that the great merchants and financiers were powerful.
But in the government of the city of London, they were often opposed by smaller merchants and tradesmen.
Then, perhaps more interesting, in general, national politics.
In sixteen forty, forty-two, you have the beginning of the Civil War.
The London crowds support Parliament and intimidate the king, Charles I, to the extent that he leaves, London.
Which was a great mistake.
He's driven out.
Because then, you see, the king looks like a rebel.
London is the capital.
He looks like a rebel trying to recapture_ trying to capture the capital.
And that's a weakness of his, all through the years of the Civil War.
And they keep him out as well.
In, um, sixteen forty-three, Charles comes closest to capturing London_ recapturing London in sixteen forty-three, but, the London Trained Bands, a sort of home guard, defeat his forces at Turnham Green in Middlesex, just outside London.
In sixteen seventy-eight, eighty-one, the Londoners support Shaftsbury, and Monmouth in the Popish Plot, a sort of anti-Catholic move, to have Monmouth, Charles IIs illegitimate son accepted as the next king, inst_ in place of Charles's Catholic brother, James Duke of York.
Physical expansion.
This is continuous.
As b- indeed was continuous after nineteen forty [sixteen forty].
The East End, to the east of the city, contained a large poor, even destitate [destitute] popu- population.
Post sixteen sixty, the West End was developed.
Splendid mansions and squares.
So, you have a national social capital for the upper classes, partly replacing the Royal Court.
In the smaller London_ much smaller London, before sixteen forty, it was already a centre for the nation's elite.
But they had to gravitate around the court in Whitehall.
Now you get the West End.
In fact West End, East End contrast, by seventeen hundred, you've already got something like the ancestor of the, division and layout today.
Both the layout, and the division between rich and poor parts.
Although it's more complex today, of course.
Religion.
This was always radical in London.
Pre-reformation, up to fifteen thirty, the London crowds were very anticlerical, uh, against the established Latin church.
You can see that, fifteen fifteen, a London merchant Han was, imprisoned, by the bishop of London, in his prisons there, for failing to pay some sort of Church tax, and he died in the prison cell.
And the Londoners, thought that the Bishop's agents had, had Han murdered, and there were, ferocious riots, against the um, bishop's servants, and indeed, against the bishop himself.
In the reformation period, fifteen thirties, fifteen sixties, Protestantism spreads more quickly in London than elsewhere.
From the fifteen eighties to sixteen forties Puritanism grows, encouraged by wealthy merchants.
This links with anti-royalism in the Civil War.
In the late sixteen forties, with the monarchy in ruins, and the Parliamentarian side quarrelling among themselves, you then get extreme Puritanism, left-wing, populace Puritan sects.
Um, like the Ranters, or Quakers who were considered wild men then.
Um, it_ and interestingly enough, you get for the first time, a secular, lower-class political party, the Levellers.
Um, who, don't depend on religion so much, but they get great support in London.
Education.
Um, London in this period, naturally had a very important role in education.
There were enough wealthy people there.
In the early sixteenth century, many grammar schools were founded.
Teaching the classics.
Latin_ revived Latin and Greek learning, which was, a big feature of the Renaissance.
Um, this Renaissance led by St.
Paul's, School, um, which, uh, then followed by Westminster School.
Um, the Inns of Court, they'd been there since the middle ages, um, where you studied law.
They were called the third university of England.
Taught law to the gentry.
Um, the amount of law the gentry learnt, was variable.
Some became professional barristers, others just had a jolly good time at the Inns of Court.
Um, but picked up enough law maybe to, apply it or misapply it when they became justices of the peace back at home, in their shires.
Um, if you read Henry V, sorry Henry IV, Shakespeare's Henry IV, which is set in the fourteen hundreds.
Notice that Falstaff, Falstaff um, young prince Hal's disreputable, ageing fat friend, makes London too hot for him who's bankrupt.
So goes to stay with a cousin of his, um, Justice Shallow.
A country gentleman in Gloucestershire, and idyllic surroundings.
Shallow has nice apple orchards, and he also is a bit of a cattle dealer, deals in bullocks.
But he_ whereas, Falstaff finds, um, Gloucestershire restful, Falstaff, the Londoner, and he gets jolly good food there.
Falstaff's very greedy.
Um, Shallow, is rather bored with this rustic idyll, and is very anxious to, talk about London, is glad to receive, uh, someone with cosmopolitan, manners, and just come from London.
And Shallow also reminisces ad nauseum about, what a lad he was.
What a hell of a lad he was, when he was a student at the il- ils- at the Inns of Court, forty years previously, and all the things he got up to.
And now, um, this is set in the fourteen hundreds.
But Shakespeare was probably thinking of the country gentry of his own day, from the fifteen sixties, fifteen nineties, to model Shallow on.
And indeed, more country gentry, were going to the Inns of Court, even though they were Medieval, in the sixteenth century, than had gone in Medieval times.
The gentry were getting better educated.
But in fact, even if you take Shallow at his period value_ face value of the early fourteen hundreds, nearly two hundred years, before Shakespeare is actually writing, there's no reason why, an early, fifteenth century squire, as opposed to a late sixteenth century one, shouldn't have gone to the Inns_ Inns of Court.
You also had Gresham's College.
A seventeenth century foundation.
Not a school or a university.
But, gave lectures on the new scientific knowledge, to the public in general.
Well, after sixteen sixty, London's educational role declines, as Renaissance-fuelled education, rather loses its, um, uh, dynamism, and becomes somewhat formulaic.
And most grammar schools stagnate, except the rich and fashionable.
E.
G.
St.
Paul's and Westminster.
A lot of the rich send their children outside London, to school, by now.
To Eton, Harrow, and Winchester.
Because, they're considered healthier than, you know, to be in London you'll likely get the plague.
Also, rich adolescent young men were more likely to be drawn into, wicked ways and temptation in London.
Whereas, Eaton at that time, was, you know, very rural.
Ha ha.
Right out in the sticks.
Hm...Well, above all, London becomes, in the seventeenth century, a centre for conspicuous consumption for the upper classes.
A role it's never lost, except you can expand it beyond the upper classes, to, I suppose anyone with money in general.
British or foreign now.
Look at Oxford Street on a busy day.
And by the early eighteenth century, London was very much the seat of the national oligarchy, both social and political_ and hell, well, rich people still do, spend part time in London.
You have to be very rich though, given the price of houses in West End_ part of the of time in the country.
Now, London's predominance, easy predominance over any other city in Britain, goes on, I think, past eighteen hundred.
That's one reason_ that's what Dr Johnson meant when he said, 'he who tires of London is tired of life.
' Because in his time, the eighteenth century, no other city approached London in terms of size, sophistication, complexity, diversity of interests, you could carry on there.
No other city in Britain, of course, not on the continent.
Um, after nineteen hundred, I don't say, London's predominance fell, but at least it could be challenged after_ sorry, after eighteen hundred, by the new industrial cities like Manchester, um, Glasgow, Birmingham.
Um, Manchester, indeed, at one point, at the height of its prosperity over cotton, tried to regard itself as, a different sort of place to London.
Down-to-earth, dynamic, liberal, um, economically efficient, more realistic, etcetera.
And, formed it's own school of economists.
So London could be challenged at least for do_ dominance within Britain, after eighteen hundred, in a way, which would be unthinkable, in our period."
"The Huguenot.
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
The Huguenot, Calvinists, were the complement in Catholic France, to the recusants in Protestant England and Wales.
Both interesting as minorities.
But unlike the British recusants, they enjoyed official toleration, for much of this period.
Um, the whole, Calvinist movement started, in France with missionaries from Geneva.
Um, Calvin was a Frenchman from northern France himself.
He settled in Geneva, because it wasn't too healthy for him to stay in France.
And he_ you could say in a way, he Frenchified Protestantism.
Lutheranism had been perhaps too German, for most French taste.
Calvin, hammers out his own theology, ins_ owing a lot to Luther, but with obviously his, clear, and somewhat extreme twist, predestination.
But he makes it more acceptable to many French people.
And, from the fifteen fifties, Calvinism spreads out, largely from Geneva into southern France, as you might expect.
Uh, well this culminates, from the early fifteen sixties, into the early fifteen nineties, in very bloody wars of religion in France.
Which nearly brings France to her knees.
I won't go into details about this, if I did I'd still be talking in six hours' time.
But, uh, it manages to get settled.
Things manage to get settled in the fifteen nineties.
Um, to cut a long story short, the Protestant leader, the Protestant prince, the first Bourbon king, Henry of Nevarre.
Um, succeeds to the throne as Henry IV of France.
Um, he has to, convert to Catholicism, to be, um, king of the whole of France.
Um, he famously says, 'Paris is worth a Mass.
' Which everyone thinks is terribly cynical.
But, it was the only way he could possibly rule France.
And the Catholics acc_ then accept him as king with relief.
But to use the old Cockney phrase, it was obvious that he was going to see his, Protestant comrades-in-arms all right.
See them right.
And the result was the Edict of Nantes, of fifteen ninety-eight, which was very favourable to the Protestants.
Um, they were allowed, to hold fortified towns, and other strong points, and run them.
The Protestants got a state within a state.
They had crystallised out at about one million, ten percent of the population.
Spreading pockets, large and small, over the remote mountainous South.
Dauphine Provence, and Languedoc.
Not everywhere, evenly spread, but there.
Um, radiating out from Geneva, it's common sense if you look at the map.
Um, the connection to Geneva is obvious.
There're also quite a lot of Protestants in Normandy.
A latter day Norman Protestant was the famous French writer Andre Gide.
Who, did most un-Protestant things in his personal life.
Which I won't go into now.
But because he had a Protestant upbringing felt very guilty about doing so.
He died in eighteen_ he died in nineteen fifty-one.
Um, the, the Norman Huguenots, were if you like, part of the North Sea Protestant wave.
Um, tapping into England and, the Netherlands.
[Throat clear] there were of course, pockets of Huguenot, elsewhere in France.
Um, some Huguenot remained very powerful.
The comrade-in-arms of Henry IV, in Dauphine.
Um, that, he made Duc de Lesdiguieres, he governed Dauphine, from Grenoble.
He rebuilt Grenoble, built palaces and castles, for himself, and became constable of France.
Which is equivalent to Earl Marshall, in England.
So even though the king had become a Catholic, his Protestant comrades did very well.
His chief minister the Duc de Sillis, was a Protestant.
But, in the seventeenth century, um, King Henry IV was assassinated in, sixteen ten.
The Protestants' position slowly worsened.
But only slowly.
So sixteen seventy-nine, sorry_ so sixteen twenty-nine, Protestant revolts might still occur, when they were annoyed.
But Richelieu, the minister of Henry's son, Louis XIII, defeated them finally, in sixteen twenty-nine.
And imposed the Grace of Allez.
Notice, not a treaty, a grace.
The privileges they retained were, uh, a, concession officially, from the kindness of the king's heart.
That was a compromise.
It took away their state within a state, their fortified towns.
But still allowed them freedom of conscience, to practice religion, with a limited number of churches.
The second seventeenth century phase, is sixteen thirty, sixteen sixty.
The height of the seventeenth century rapprochement.
Um, France was practically a Protestant power in foreign affairs.
It had Protestant allies in the Thirty Years' War, and it needed its own Protestants, or else could not afford to antagonise them.
The Protestants were very loyal and patriotic.
There was no conflict between patriotism, and religion, vis-a-vis, fighting the wicked Spaniards.
Who were, Catholics, who were historic enemies of France.
Um, Mazarin, a Catholic Cardinal, Italian in fact, not French, who ruled France's prime ministers from sixteen forty-two to sixteen sixty-one.
Said about the Huguenots, 'the little flock may pasture on weeds,' that's false doctrine, 'but at least they do not stray.
'Then you get the the third phase, sixteen sixty, sixteen seventy-nine.
The Thirty Years' War has very much been won, by France.
France is now top power in Europe.
Mazarin has died, and young King, Louis the XIV, is ruling personally, now the great minister's dead.
And there's increasing pressure on Protestants.
Remember they'd been losing ground, literally, all through the seventeenth century.
And especially after and through the Grace of Allez.
Um, Capuchin and other missionaries had tried to, get Protestants to volunary_ voluntarily renounce their religion.
Jesuit Schools, and Ursuline Schools, opened up in Protestant strongholds, to try and get the children of the elite to turn Catholic, and so on.
Now the pressure was intensified.
Not just missions, from Catholics, but discrimination.
Various employments were denied to Huguenot.
Um, for example, a, Huguenot, lords of the manor, could not appoint, Protestant justices, or judges to judge, the local court cases.
But, um, except in isolated incidences, pressure was not yet intolerable, and France had to please, um, Protestant allies like Sweden, in the sixteen seventies when she, got into new wars.
And you couldn't do that if you were bloodily repressing your own Protestants.
But, in sixteen seventy-nine, with the Treaty of Nijmegen, France emerges obviously the superpower of Europe.
And Louis felt he could do what he liked.
So you get the fourth phase.
The savagely repressive prelude, sixteen eighty, eighty-five to the Revocation.
Um, all sorts of employments were denied to the Huguenot.
In sixteen eighty-four their churches, known as temples, were bulldozed.
At least they would've been bulldozed, if they'd had bulldozers in fifteen eighty-four.
They had to adopt, different methods of destruction.
But destroyed they were.
Um, finally, um, in, October the eighteenth, sixteen eighty-five, Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes, Edict of Fontainebleau, um, Protestantism could no longer be practised in France, officially.
Protestants themselves were, grudgingly allowed freedom conscience, but they couldn't practice their religion, either in their churches, which had been razed anyway, or even at home.
Um, as a result hundreds of thousands of Protestants, left the country.
Louis thought he was completing a perfect Catholic land.
This didn't work, because even many Catholics were horrified at his deed.
Um, France's loss was the gain of many other countries.
Um, the Netherlands, Brandenburg, and other German States, and England.
Um, Huguenots went there.
Were useful, both in the, armies, fighting against France.
And also, as craftsmen, and financiers.
The Bank of England was founded in sixteen ninety-four, by a Huguenot called Houblon, among others, for example, fighting against his own country.
And for King William, the ruler of the Netherlands, and of England.
Um, even to this day, many people in England, and even more in northern Germany, can trace part of their descent back to Huguenot ancestors.
It's interesting because, the Revocation, we compare it, because it's almost a prolepsis, of the Nazi and Soviet persecutions of, living memory.
And indeed, persecutions are going on in more minor dictatorships today.
If we had time, we'd compare the, differences and similarities between, Louis's state terrorism, and the state terrorism of, the twentieth century.
But we haven't got time.
Lastly, why were the French Calvinist called Huguenot.
I don't know, you tell me.
There've been many ingenious explanations, why they got this nickname, but none of them are particularly convincing."
"Well I think, that the, impeachment, trial should come, to an end, soon.
Because, for one reason there is no chance of, nailing, President Clinton, with_ a sense, with a, uh... A guilty verdict from the, United States Senate.
Um, I feel that he should be made to pay some money, and do, some kind of, work.
To um show that he is paying a price for his, weakness.
Um, this week_ this week there is a cover of the New Yorker magazine, of a woman who has, the exact coloring and shape of Mona Lisa.
Except that her face is the face of Monica Lewinski.
And that's so funny.
The, con- congruence between Mona Lisa and Monica.
I think, people, are laughing at us, it is not paranoid.
It's funny in a way.
It's really scary that the, um, media have no, compunctions any more t- about things like this with respect to, uh, people like_ public people, like the president.
So... But, um, I'm glad my T-V went out last week.
I'm not... Spending time with that instead of reading something nice.
Which has nothing to do with this, scandal.
But it's nice to see_ I believe that he will not be_ not have to lose his job.
It's, it's true that he has... Hm, you would say committed sins.
But, because the country needs him, and he has so many good qualities.
He should be made to pay some kind of thing to_ to us, to make himself feel, that he has done the right thing.
For the country to let go, and go onto the next thing.
Which largely I think is just_ the next thing is arguing with the Republicans.
Who don't seem to have the right idea, they wanna nail him in the most humiliating way possible.
But he has a very strong, attitude I think, given his, state of the union speech a few weeks ago.
He didn't allude one moment to the fact that he had been impeached by the House of Representatives.
In a way though, he's a sleazy character, who's perhaps_ he's_ he's lacking in character in some respects.
I dunno what his wife thinks.
I'll bet the marriage doesn't last after he leaves office."
"We are currently, um, going through, a very, sad time in our country.
And, um, I think it's_ in a way it's- it is sad.
But in another way, I believe it shows the strength of the United States.
And what I am referring to, is the impeachment of our president, uh, Bill Clinton.
This is_ uh  it's sad because, of his action and what he did.
Um, in doing something that was, less than moral.
And that was dishonest as far as his relationship with his wife, and with his, uh, child, with his daughter.
So that to me is what's sad about it.
And of course all the media play, and attention that's been focused on something that in my opinion is very personal, and should not have gotten this far at, at all.
But the fact that it has, um, and that it is dragging on and on.
Is, um, is also very discouraging and disheartening to me.
But on the positive side of it, I think it's is is interesting that our country, although very very young.
Uh, admittedly, uh, has a system of government that allows for a process to work its way through.
Uh, we don't have something that is_ we don't have people rioting in the streets.
And, we don't have bread lines, and people concerned about, a police state or anything like that.
So in that regard I find what is happening very uplifting.
Because, when you look, globally there's so much unrest, and, um, political fear sometimes.
That, um, others find in in countries that don't have a democracy, or a particular system of government.
So from that regard I find it, um, uplifting.
But all in all I think, I have felt sorriest for the family.
Um, I cannot imagine, uh, Chelsea, the daughter, how she must feel.
Uh, being a young woman, and knowing her father did, uh, these things with, uh, someone who is very close to her age.
I can't imagine how, Hilary, his wife, feels.
Um, the embarrassment and the hurt, that she feels.
And, unfortunately because of the media, um... Focus on this event, you don't have the sense that, as a family they've had the, opportunity to even heal within the unit of the family.
When every day there is a new, um, something else coming out in the newspaper or on the television, about what is going on.
Um, either in Congress or with the attorneys or with the, Office of Independent Council.
So it's_ um, I wish there would have been some time, uh, perhaps left where we would have been, uh, told you cannot discuss this situ- publicly in the media, because we are going to give the family time to heal.
And to work things through.
But if that had been mandated that wouldn't be part of our system of government either.
Would it?"
"The International Monetary Fund, was established after the deregulation of capital markets during the Nixon administration.
Immediately after the United States withdrew from the gold standard it opened capital markets, to worldwide corporations.
It was also found that the_ using the international monetary fund a newly created organization as the lender for last resort, for many developing, and underdeveloped countries, has actually stood to the benefit of American, many American corporations.
The International Monetary Fund philosophy is merely this.
Those governments that are subjected to needing, vast amounts of money from the Fund are required to follow its strictures.
Often what have been followed are prescriptions regard- regarded as neo-liberal.
These ideas are essentially perversions of post-enlightenment capitalist theory, popularized particularly during the nineteen-eighties under the American President Ronald Reagan, and the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.
These concepts are very simple.
These countries that received billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund must first, open their capital markets, they must also, have very tight budget restrictions.
That is they spend less and less money on social spending programs for the benefit of driving an export led economy.
The inten- the intention of this of course is to open their markets for, foreign investment number one as a means of providing further capital, for their, purportedly sagging economies.
To drive exports is a means of generating capital, such that they can pay back their debt to the International Monetary Fund pool, and at the same time liberize_ liberalize or that is make more free the labor market, such that foreign investment that comes in finds cheap national resources.
An example of this includes the I-M-F bail out of Mozambique, particularly in the late nineteen-seventies when the Mozambican economy collapsed after years of civil war with withdrawal of the Portuguese colonial forces.
Mozambique, has borrowed a very small sum, three billion dollars, from the International Monetary Fund.
But Mozambique is natur- nat- is poor in natural resources and is not a highly industrialized society.
It has nevertheless used whlat funds it does have, for the benefit of the I- International Monetary Fund.
A fully twi- twenty-five percent of all of its exports are, given to the International Monetary Fund in debt service.
These amounts of money are incredibly small.
So small in fact that, Mozambique can not hope to pay off its debt, its mere three billion dollar debt to the International Monetary Fund, for another two hundred years.
In the process the twenty-five percent of money that they are giving um from their exports is not going to education and healthcare.
Which is probably the worst in all of sub-Saharan African with the exception of the central states of Burundi or Rwanda.
What is more the tentacles of the International Monetary Fund have begun to stretch into other parts of the world, particularly Latin America as it has been used as the lender of last resort for a crumbling Mexican Peso.
And also in East Asia, particularly in the cases of Indonesia and, South Korea, wherein, large amounts of International Monetary Fund money have gone in, um, in hand-in-hand with policy suggestions that have caused a further contraction of alread- economies already suffering from a credit crisis.
What has happened to these economies instead, has watched and_ th- their economies contract as labor, as labor prices have collapsed.
Their cu- currencies have also collapsed making their good so cheap in fact, cheap for the benefit of the countries that sponsor the International Monetary Fund.
But so cheap, that they cannot generate the income that is actually necessary to put the economy back on its own independent feet.
These sorts of practices advocated widely mainly by the Western, uh, participants in the International Monetary Fund have actually caused massive crises and a cycle of dependence, on the part of Third World nations.
Particularly in under developed portions of the world, um, particularly in Central America, South America, Africa, South East Asia.
And have now begun to actually migrate into more, developed societies including South Korea, uh, and even eventually into portions of, uh, Eastern Europe including Poland and Russia.
These implications have actually shown that they have_ these countries have not benefited from the I-M-F practice.
They have not benefited from the one-time loan.
And instead have watched a gradual loss of sovereignty.
Therefore one can see that the International Monetary Fund, founded for the benefit of corporations and the benefit of their participant,s has actually, done great damage to the."
"""did somebody say McDonald's.""  this very famous commercial, um, is very familiar to everybody here in the United States.
McDonald's today, is one of the two, most recognized and powerful brands in the world.
And is one of the mo- world's great entrepreneur organization.
With most restaurants worldwide run by a franchisee, or affiliate partner of the company.
The story began in nineteen-fifty-four when Ray Kroc was granted exclusive U-S franchising, rights, by the brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald.
Who were pioneers of the McDonald's, and the quick service restaurant industry.
He opened his first McDonald's in (Dayplains) Illinois, in April nineteen fifty-five and founded company that evolved into McDonald's Corporation.
With more than twenty-four_ twenty-four hundred, five_  twenty-four thousand five hundred McDonalds restaurant in a- about one hundred fourteen countries.
Rather than tinkle with the successful format, Kroc retained the McDonald's formula of a limited menu, quality food, in assembly line production system, and fast friendly service.
Adding to that, his own demanding standards for cleanness.
Indeed quality service, cleanness, and value, Q-S-C and V continue as McDonald's operating principle today.
In this case, we will, uh, discuss a main problem McDonald, um, met_ maybe they are_ encountered today, which is the waiting line problem we discussed in the, uh, man- operation management class.
How to balance the tension between the cost of waiting in line and the cost of providing more service.
Can McDonald re-engineer its, fabled system and, pro- procedures to spare customers from having to choose between food quality, and speed service.
When people walk into the... McDonald's... They may ask them one quest- there will be one question they will ask themselves.
Do I get hot, fresh food or fast service.
When you order... A quarter pounder without cheese, a custom item, chances are your burger will be hotter, fresher, and better tasting... Than the ones sitting in the warming bin.
And you will probably have a more satisfying experience than the customer behind.
If only you don't have to wait so long.
He will likely, be out of the door while you are still standing at the counter, watching your fries growing cold.
For many years McDonald's order production system, worked just fine.
McDonald's could simply open the restaurant and it would be guaranteed to do well.
However, things are different now.
Both in and outside the company.
Every time your turn around, another franchisee, is complaining that they aren't making the kind of money they once did.
More restaurants are competing for the customers.
Significant market share increase come only at expense of someone else.
And the concept of good value has (grownen) up fast.
The highly competitive fast food, business is forcing McDonald's to take action.
Managers, need to make the business process more efficient  and adaptable.
After more than four decades of batch pre- preparing its food.
McDonald's is trying to focus on, one order at a time now.
As two of its top competitors Burger King and Wendy's profess to do.
In other words, just-in-time production is the ca- the center piece of the effort, that allows customers to have both hot, fresh food and fast service.
How this just-in-time system works.
It almost completely abandons the batch style of food preparation, that was one of the McDonald's brothers' original concept.
As described in [xx] store.
In its place will come a rapid file computer based production system.
In which sandwiches aren't until customers order them.
Stuffers can't start filling order until specify of each sandwich light up, on the video screen where assemblers are stan- stationed.
By eliminating the holding stage, management expects to raise the bar, significantly, on quality and overall value.
Food costs should also drop because unsold, pro- product won't have to be discusted [discarded] and some labor hour can be saved and reallocated to improve operations elsewhere.
The new system will also enable stores to boost their capacity at peak periods.
And give the chain most flexib- flexibility in this future men-menu develop- development efforts.
This is business process re-engineering.
McDonald's is trying different ways of doing things, and looking for radical changes.
At a recent visit to a just-in-time test site, we can see that McDonald's ninety-second goal.
Which is the total time between ordering and deliver, was easily surpassed during the breakfast rush.
A sandwich order was delivered, with a side and coffee, before the customer had finished paying it - paying for it.
At, at a point where more than three customers on the line, and transactions typically took more time than the preparation.
In this cases they can solve the queuing problem."
"Here I want to talk about, um, another, problem McDonald's has right now.
Is the quality problem.
Uh, if you look at the mission at the McDonald's ah Corporation they say they want total customer satisfaction.
But how can they do that.
How can McDonald's improve their ability to satisfy customer needs, in order to achieve its goal of providing one hundred percent total customer satisfaction.
McDonald's original system, was engineered to handle two basic products.
The hamburger and the cheeseburger.
The limited menu concept triggered the fast food concept.
Because focusing on just a few items that were prepared with standardized procedures, made food service a model of efficiency.
And buying food supplies in quantity, as the restaurant chain grown fast_ larger enabled McDonald's to keep their prices low.
The business was built on the idea, that you make it one way and everybody eats it that way.
However, customers don't act that way anymore.
And the production system was not designed to deliver specific requests.
Now with many restaurants offering over twenty regular menu items, McDonald's needs to be_ make a change.
Increased customer prefer- preferences will be a powerful trend in the future.
How can McDonald's, take better care of customers in the hotly competitive, fast food market and meet customers' expectations.
Besides just insi_  just-in-time production system.
McDonald's has become much more customer friendly.
It also has engaged, strategies to improve speed and accuracy of service, at the drive through.
Which commands about fifty-four per cent of McDonald's sales.
Speed and accuracy at the drive through will be a key point of different- differentiation within quick service.
Yesterday purchased brands noted value.
Today while brands are important, consumers are much more concerned with price value.
Which means the total experience you received for what you pay.

Every school child knew, or used to know this date.
There is even a send up of school history, named after it.
Ten sixty-six and all that.
And this is with reason.
Uh, it has claims to be the most significant turning point, uh, in English history, for hundreds of years on either side.
Um, the Normans, were French speakers from Northern France.
Although, in the complications of those days, their elites had actually come from Scandinavia.
They were Vikings who'd, gone to speak French, settled in France and spoke French, a few, hundred years before.
But with them, England got not just a new dynasty, but a new elite, a new official language, French, and a new French-speaking culture.
Conversely, the old Anglo Saxon, and, indeed, Anglo Danish elite.
The landholding class, the Thanes, seems to have been dispossessed.
Very largely dispossessed.
And, Anglo Saxon, ceased to be an official language.
It was replaced by French.
The result was, that educated Anglo Saxon, uh, dropped away, died out.
The common people continued to speak Anglo Saxon, but they spoke it badly.
And, the curious effect is, that modern English is an amalgam of, bad Anglo Saxon, and Norman French.
Which is why, whereas, in most European languages, for example, the objective agrees with the noun, becomes plural.
In English it doesn't.
A black cat.
Black cats.
You don't find that in other European languages, that I know of.
And French becomes the language of culture.
Then, the French infusion receives another boost with the Angevin Dynasty, who came roughly a hundred years afterwards.
Descended from the Normans in ten five three, uh, ten five four.
So, the early_ what might be called the early high middle ages in England, changes from a somewhat Germanic culture, to at the elite level, a French culture.
You can see this expressed in the new architecture.
The Romanesque architecture that the Normans brought with them.
Which they used to build cathedrals.
Um, some of it can be seen in Christchurch Cathedral, here in Oxford, for example.
Defense.
The castles.
The Normans, um, alt_ were the most famous coun_ nation at the time for building castles.
At first of wood, and then, formidably of stone.
They're all over Britain.
Not just in England, but in Wales, and Southern Scotland.
When the Normans penetrated there.
Indeed, the Welsh called the Normans 'the castle men'.
And, they were built to an elaborate pattern.
With their mote and bailey, and then the great fortified stone towers.
Okay, they may well have had fortifications in Anglo Saxon's times.
But they seem to have been overwhelmingly of wood, wooden stockades, rather than stone.
And, not as impressive.
They're also associated with horsemen, <em>chevalier</em> in French.
Mounted warriors, knights in English.
Again, the word 'knight' is Anglo Saxon.
So did the Anglo Saxons have knights.
Yes, but not to such a great degree.
The Normans are especially associated with cavalry.
People fighting on horseback.
Um, to revert again to the church.
Norman bishops, the most famous of whom was William the Conquerer's half brother, Odo, replaced the Anglo Saxon bishops.
And the same with the rest of the high clergy, as far as we can tell.
But it's not just bishops.
The church reforms and n_ monastic orders, all came from Normandy.
So, between ten sixty-six, and about eleven ten, the English church was transformed.
The changes the Normans brought, can be in a large degree, summed up by feudalism.
Now feudalism is a chain.
Um, the only person, who theoretically owns all the land in the country is the king.
But obviously, he can't look after all of it himself.
So he, grants it out, in a sort of long-term feudal tenure.
First of all to his dukes and earls.
Then they grant it out to knights and gentry.
And the knights and gentry grant out their estates, on tenure to the peasants.
Who're the people who actually do the work.
Actually plow the land with the oxen, you've probably seen in medieval drawings.
Rather laboriously.
And this feudal chain, caught everyone up in the country.
In Anglo Saxon England, it doesn't seem really to have existed, in that form.
People are vague about Anglo Saxon land holding arrangements.
But, they_ it seems to have been different from the Norman.
And there were more free peasants.
Overall, there's a general reorientation from the Scandinavian, Germanic world, to a French one, for the elite, at least.
Which in some ways, you might say, to revert to, an older school of history writing, is a good thing.
Because, French culture at the time, as it was to be say later in the seventeenth century, was, the great, dynamic European culture of that day.
It was producing, literature, in it's own language, French, rather than just writing in Latin.
It was the language of love, literature, song.
And, um, the language of a more elaborate upper-class civilisation.
And the Normans when they were not being brutal, which they could also be, brought all that to England.
But, we must not underestimate the continuity, with Anglo Saxon England.
The Monarchy itself, and many institutions, like the shires, and the counties, and the sheriffs.
The sheriffs, who ran the shires for the King.
Were all inherited from Anglo Saxon England, even though the Sheriff might now be a Norman, rather than, an Anglo Saxon.
The archetypal one in legend, is the, the Sheriff of Nottingham, who was the great enemy of the, mich_ mythical outlaw, Robin Hood, of the eleven nineties.
Um, also, as ten sixty-six fades into the past, we must not ascribe to the Norman conquest, things, which would probably have come to pass anyway.
For example, Gothic architecture.
That arrives in England from Norman France after twelve hundred.
But... Um, as part of the European stream, it would probably have come, even if England had remained a purely Anglo Saxon state.
Eventually, of course, the two streams, the Anglo Saxons, and the Normans merged.
Remember the Normans, or, if you like, more general term, French-speakers.
They're always a fairly small min- minority, between ten and twenty thousand.
While people of Anglo Saxon, or to more clear, more precise, Anglo Danish, are over a million, at least.
So, in the end, the two streams merged.
Norman, gentry have to learn some Anglo Saxon to communicate with their, um, serfs for example.
Just as in nineteenth-century India, British had to learn Hindi or Urdu, to some degree, or other Indian languages.
And by the fourteenth century, England, and the English are neither Anglo Saxon, nor Norman, and neither is the English language.
By the fourteenth century, by the time of Chaucer, you have a recognisable ancestor of, the English tongue, by the thirteen eighties, and that is a kind of mixture, in base, to oversimplify, of, simplified Anglo Saxon, and, Norman French vocabulary."
"The prime minister and the cabinet.
Um, we've heard much, about relatively recent growth.
Since the nineteen forties in, the power of the prime minister, at the expense of his own cabinet.
Ever since I've been, more or less grown up, every prime minister, from Wilson to Blair, has been compared crudely by a political opponent or a journalist, of be_ or accused of, behaving like Hitler, or at least like Mussolini.
Which of course, is largely rubbish.
Um, uh, and it's considered this is a recent, um, innovation as they say.
And that, at some idealised time in the past, the eighteen fifties, the prime minister's power was much more moderate and sensible and the prime minister was just a first among equals, um, in his cabinet.
This, idea of the prime minister as first among equals was much, publicised, made famous by Walter Bajehot, a great Victorian authority.
Whose British Constitution was published in eighteen sixty-seven.
There are several things you can say about that.
It's often treated as a Bible, by, alleged constitutional experts in Britain, as if it's holy writ or a volume, um, morality or ethics.
In fact at best, it's an_ it's a description of, how the British Constitution worked in the eighteen fifties and sixties.
So, it's, a description of a passing phase.
And secondly, um, there're grounds for believing that Bajehot wasn't accurate in what he said about the_ not entirely accurate, in what he said about the eighteen fifties and sixties.
The_ even then, the idea that the prime minister is a first among equals, was, fifty percent, nonsense.
Um, the power of the prime minister, has always been very large.
In the eighteen twenties, the eighteen fifties, the, nineteen hundred to the nineteen twenties.
Whenever you care to look.
The prime minister essentially decides the date of the election.
The monarch, can't really stop him.
Um, and, he controls the cabinet agenda.
That gives you immense power.
Um, the American president, for instance, can't decide the date of any election.
Elections are held at fixed terms, written by the constitution.
So it's a great contrast.
Two, the prime minister determines the career of his cabinet colleagues.
Um, he can advance, slow down, or even destroy, um, the career, of a cabinet minister or a more junior minister.
Um, and this was true even in the eighteen twenties.
Um, but we can add, a recent growth in, um, prime ministerial power, since the nineteen forties at least.
Um, I would hesitate to say this means they behave like Hitler.
Or, even that they, have become like the American president.
Which is the fashionable analogy.
But there has certainly been a growth.
Why.
Media personalisation helps, image making.
Um, one thing you can say about the age of Gladstone and Disraeli, in the eighteen seventies eighties, is that they didn't have television.
What a silly thing to say, you might be thinking.
Of course they didn't have television in the eighteen seventies and eighties.
We know that, everyone does.
But think of the implications.
You did not see, um, Mr Gladstone and Mr Disraeli in your living room, every night.
They were remoter figures.
Um, they couldn't appeal to the electorate over the heads, perhaps, of their quarrelling colleagues.
There was less temptation to personalise, politics in the party's drive, as, um, Mr Gladstone versus Disraeli, although an attempt was made.
But this is less_ less successful, than today.
But, nowadays, um, our media, both the popular newspapers and T-V, who love to personalise, and simplify, have a field day.
And, politicians play up to this.
Politicians, I think, really, from the time of Gladstone and Disraeli, always wanted to have an image and a personality, and both those characters did.
But it's easier to project one now than it ever was.
Because there is a T-V in the sitting, s- sitting room, or even the kitchen, of practically every family in the land.
Um, and, the prime minister, and to a lesser extent, the leader of the official opposition, gets much better known than his various ministers.
Um, closely allied to this, another change in technology, jetting around in the wor_ the world.
A prime minister can project himself as a world statesman, or stateswoman.
Mrs Thatcher, prime minister, nineteen seventy-nine, nineteen ninety is a classic example of this process.
She started off as very much perceived as a domestic and provincial politician.
Her hated rival, was far better known in Europe, and in the world, than she was.
By the way her hated rival was not the leader of the Labour Party at the time.
It was Mr Heath, the man that she'd just deposed as Tory Party Leader, who'd previously been prime minister.
While Mrs  Thatcher in the late nineteen seventies was just unknown, uh, relatively abroad.
And she seemed very interested in, um, domestic issues.
But by nineteen ninety, she fancied herself as a world stateswoman, with some, justification.
She seemed to be worshipped by the anti-communists in eastern Europe.
Um, why did she fall in nineteen ninety.
Well one reason is, she preferred to swank around at a conference in Paris, with the other great people of the, um, universe.
Like President Mitterrand, President Bush, Chancellor Cole of Germany.
She preferred to do that, rather than come home and mend her domestic fences.
Roll her sleeves up, and go into this, sordid business of making sure, every last Tory M-P voted for her.
She left that to her underlings, and it was her undoing.
So the world statesman role is very tempting.
But surely it was tempting a hundred and fifty years ago.
Yes, but you didn't have Concorde, you didn't have planes of any sort.
Um, Disraeli in eighteen seventy-eight, went to the congress of Berlin by train, but even that took days.
Um, and domestic cabinet ministers can't compete in this world statesman role, almost, um, by definition.
Um, some, informed people know the name of the German minister of finance.
But, do you know the name of the federal German, minister of education, uh, the federal German minister of the environment, etcetera.
Okay, you might do if you're a German, but if you're not, I bet you don't.
Um, thirdly, the prime minister's one of the few ministers with the time for an overview of all government work.
Um, over the last hundred years, there's been a great growth, uh, in crude quantitive_ quantitative terMs  and a growth also in the complexity of government worth_ work.
So double whammy.
Um, and cabinet ministers are fully absorbed in their own remits.
In the eighteen fifties this was less so, what the government did was simpler, and it did less of it anyway.
So an intelligent minister had time to poke his nose, into what, the government as whole, or what his colleagues were doing, and then they could challenge the prime minister.
Four, the growth of the party system, and bureaucracy.
The complex political parties, uh, controlled by the prime minister as party leader.
Prime ministers are always party leaders.
I know they needn't be, but it's very rare that they're not.
Um, fifthly colleagues are more likely to be professional politicians, depends on the prime minister for their careers and incomes.
Bajehot was right in one way, contrast the eighteen fifties, Bajehot's day.
The days when Lord Palmerston was prime minister.
When Lord Aberdeen was prime minister, when Lord Derby was prime minister.
All these litany of lords has a point about it.
Cabinet colleagues, were often independently wealthy.
They were independent earls, like the prime minister himself.
And if the prime minister offended them, they can flounce off or, in_ as men were men in those days, stride off, indignantly.
Then spend their time translating Homer or Virgil, which is a common, um, pursuit for, nineteenth century statesmen.
Or if they were less intellectual, spend their time in the south of France, doing, more luxurious and self-indulgent things.
But they didn't have to res- um, rely on, politics for their living.
The party system was also concomitantly weaker.
Um, if you resign these days you may be rejected by the party even your own constituency.
Not then, you often, controlled, if you were a, a cabinet minister an earl, you often control the local constituency, in effect.
So ministers could afford to resign.
Um, so the first among equals talk in the eighteen fifties, as I said, was not quite true.
But at least truer than now.
Nowadays if a minister resigns, his, political career may be over, and certainly he takes a big financial cut.
But there are still limitations on the power of the prime minister.
One, their time in office, has not been particularly long.
Say, for Mrs Thatcher, he_ who had eleven years.
And most prime ministers who left were judged failures when the left office.
The latest, poor Mr Major, who had to, preside over four, four years, a governing party, tearing itself to pieces.
And, he didn't have the strength, or couldn't find a way, of shutting them all up.
He even resigned at one point, and told them to re-elect him or reject him.
He got re-elected.
But it's curious it, showed an exasperation with his own party.
Two, the prime minister cannot withstand a clique of powerful cabinet ministers, if they gang up on him.
Much less, the whole cabinet united against him.
He needs the heavyweights in the cabinet on his side.
And he must persuade them, often, not just dictate or cajole.
So the cabinet as a collective entity has some power.
But, above all, this reflects the fact the prime minister's elected by the party as a party leader.
He's not elected directly as prime minister by the people.
Um, this limits any comparison with the U-S president, which is always considered a very sexy comparison.
But the U-S president's an elected monarch, elected directly by the people.
He towers over any o_ any members of his own party, and certainly any members of his own cabinet, who he just appoints.
American, cabinet ministers are not elected by anybody.
Um, the British prime minister doesn't enjoy that role.
He or she is the party's, chief servant.
Has a lot of power if things are going well.
Um, prime ministers in, the Conservative Party, and now Mr Blair in the Tory Par_ uh, uh, in the Labour Party, sorry, are given blank cheques almost, or a very, long rope, as long as things are going well.
But when things start going badly, they jerk back again.
If they lose the support of their party, they can be forced to resign.
They get the sack.
This is what happened to Mrs Thatcher, who seemed, impregnable for, a very long time, in nineteen ninety.
There was a Conservative backbench revolt, and she went."
"The trial and execution of Charles I, January, sixteen forty-nine.
In the Middle Ages, many English kings had been disposed of violently, and not a few on the continent.
And then, in the fifteen nineties, the fate of these kings was written up, by Marlowe and Shakespeare.
We can give plenty of examples.
Marlowe's <em>Edward VII</em>, sorry, ha ha, my mistake.
Marlowe's <em>Edward II</em>.
Murdered in a horrible way in thirteen twenty-seven.
Um, Shakespeare wrote about Richard II, murdered thirteen ninety-ni- no, fourteen hundred, maybe.
Um, Henry VI, also written by Shakespeare, murdered after capture in the Battle of Tewkesbury, after being captured.
Then Richard III, not so much directly murdered as killed in hot blood, on the battlefield of Bosworth, fourteen, eighty-five.
The very tragic, pathetic fates of the two boys, um, King Edward V and his brother Richard Duke of York, who were, possibly, murdered by Richard III, so he could seize the throne.
He was their uncle.
Which means that, if that was the case, Richard III got his comeuppance, two years later.
Then the first Tudor king who benefited, Henry VII, didn't get a comeuppance.
Died in bed, in fourteen oh ni- fifteen oh nine, a bit fearful.
Mind you if, he was the one who had, murdered the boy King Edward V and his brother, then perhaps he deserved a comeuppance.
But, anyway, he didn't get one.
Um, what I've said, that in the Middle Ages, um, it was no, unusual event, for kings, to die a violent death.
As Shakespeare said, 'uneasy lies the head, that wears the crown.
' So what was new, about the trial and execution of Charles I, in sixteen forty-nine.
Well, medieval regicides, were hole in the corner affairs.
Shamefaced.
Essentially, what had happened is, a new monarch, maybe the son, or cousin, or whatever, of the successful_ unsuccessful deposed monarch had seized the throne.
And obviously you just couldn't allow, the deposed one to live.
Because there'd be a revulsion in his favour and he'd, have a come_ make a come back.
You had to kill him if you wanted to carry on being king yourself.
So, the poor chaps were usually deposed of, um, done away with, in some cell somewhere.
All rather nasty.
The nastiest death, was rumoured to be that of Edward II, in thirteen twenty-seven.
The precise circumstances of which I won't go into.
And then fake stories were given out, that, the king had died naturally, or died of despair or something.
The imprisoned king.
Um, rather nobler, at least, was Richard III's death in battle.
But, Charles's, execution, came after a very long period, over one hundred and fifty years.
When all that was supposed to be behind us.
The Tudors, naturally, thought that it was, very much behind us.
They had a great interest in doing so.
Um, they pushed the idea that monarch was sacrosanct.
Indeed the representative of God on Earth.
Which was all the easier to do when England became Protestant.
So then you didn't have the Pope as a rival for that role.
And, indeed, that the monarch was a sort of lay Pope, God's anointed.
And this had been hammered remorselessly in, from the time of, Henry VII, who didn't have too much claim to be a g_ um, God on Earth.
He was a talented chancellor_ a talented chancer, sorry.
Who managed to grab the throne by luck, Bosworth Field, we just dealt with.
Hammered in remorselessly from his time in the fif- fourteen eighties, to Charles I's own time in the sixteen thirties.
The only problem is, it seemed to work for the Tudors.
It obviously didn't work for Charles.
And that's the surprising thing.
Um, then came, after all this propaganda, there came the Civil War against the king.
Culminating, in this open public example.
Um, and it was a new sort of regicide.
Cromwell said, the organiser and leader, the man who made it all possible, was Thomas Crom- not Thomas, Oliver Cromwell.
The, the general of the new model army.
Who was really the most powerful man in the kingdom.
If you can still call it a kingdom, by sixteen forty-nine.
And, Cromwell said, 'we will cut off the king's head, with a crown on it.
It will be open and public.
'Um, the monarch himself, and the whole institution of monarchy, was put on trial.
This is a rather modern idea.
It looks to the future.
Little to do, with, sordid medieval assassinations.
And, in fact, Charles's trial, parallels the Nuremberg war crimes trials, of nineteen forty-five in some ways.
Or the trials now being, rather unsuccessfully, mounted in theory, of various, um, Balkan, cut-throats, um, just as I speak.
Um, the king was accused of abuse of office.
Betrayal of responsibilities, of making war, on his own people.
He was condemned to death on those grounds.
Charles Stuart, condemned to death as Charles Stuart, King of England.
Nothing, no fiction that he'd abdicated, or anything like that, so he'd be killed as a private man.
And this was a savage early contribution, to democratic accountability.
The idea that a ruler could be called to account, deposed, and punished.
Um, it was also, at a less, exalted level, a political party move.
Cromwell, the militarist, and extreme republicans, wanted to show there was no going back, to a monarchy.
Uh, this didn't work because it merely passed on Charles's claims to his nineteen-year-old son, who hadn't offended, any- anybody.
And was a young, good looking, and dashing lad in exile.
Beyond the clutches of, uh, the, parl_ of the Cromwellian party.
Against this, the king argued, the divine right position of monarchy.
Um, and, he argued it very well.
Um, the idea that the king had been put, in his position by God, and was accountable only to God.
Charles behaved extremely well at his trial.
He argued a very good case.
He knew a lot of law, and he did it himself.
Where it shows that Charles, was, a lousy, useless politician, in a way.
Otherwise he wouldn't have got in this position.
But, a clever and cultivated man.
The only problem is, all this was futile.
No one was very int_ as_ at the time anyway, no one was very interested in hearing him.
And he duly got executed.
And, we all_ we all know, or, lots of British people know, the hieratic scenes of so many of the executions of Whitehall.
So England, had the first revolutionary republic in Europe, ever.
The Dutch case, um, seventy years earlier, is a somewhat different thing.
Um, and followed reluctantly by Scotland, who abolished the monarchy, a few months later.
Um, and this sets the example for the, execution of Louis XVI of France in seventeen ninety-three.
And, f- for that of the Tzar Nicholas and his family in nineteen eighteen.
Although there was no trial of Tzar Nicholas.
It was more like, uh, old fashioned medieval-style murder.
But then that's Russia for you.
But, in fact, um, the trial and execution, of Charles, did not have popular support.
It was the work, of, a faction, who were powerful, because they were the new model army.
But they were, too radical, for the vast majority of English, and certainly Welsh people.
The Welsh, by the way, were very royalist.
Um, when news of the execution of the king got about, pregnant young women had spontaneous abortions, and aging men dropped down dead of a stroke on the spot.
Even though they were not expected to die there and then.
The shock was too much.
And these are well-authenticated.
Um, secondly, the king, behaved in exemplary fashion personally, both on the trial, and at the scene of his execution.
He even said_ requested two vests for this cold January day, because he said, 'i, don't want to shiver with cold, in case, onlookers think I'm shivering with fear.
It's not the way for a king to die.
' And the Anglicans, of course, then canonise him as St.
Charles the Martyr.
In St.
Mary Magdeline Church in Oxford, a commemorative service for St.
Charles the Martyr is held every thirtieth of January, on the commemoration of his execution.
And you can see his image, with candles round, any, any time you go into the church.
So it could be argued that England's revolution, or revolutionary phase, came too early.
It was premature.
It ended in a compromise, sixteen sixty, when Charles II gets back.
And it actually saved the monarchy, in a constitutional form.
Uh, the monarchy, is after all, still here today."
"Towns, in late 15th-century England.
The first thing to note is that in stark contrast to today, England was an overwhelmingly rural country.
We can't talk then, about the man in the street, it has to be the man in the field.
Um, nevertheless there were towns, perhaps they contained overall about ten percent of the population.
We can't be sure.
As opposed to eighty percent of a much bigger population today.
And there were four broad categories of towns.
Number one was London, which was in a class of its own.
Sixty to seventy thousand people, which was immense by contemporary standards.
Nothing touched it.
Then you had say, a dozen, provincial centres, like York and Norwich.
Which might be, twelve to twenty thousand people.
Uh, so there's a big drop.
Number three, you had, um, towns who had, perhaps, um, four to ten thousand people.
Um, Oxford would come into that category.
Um, after that you had towns with below four thousand.
And who_ which were called simple towns.
They weren't usually chartered boroughs i.
E.
Recognised as self-governing by the king.
But they were local market centres.
And their population might even be under a thousand.
Uh, so they'd appear to us, just like a village.
But nevertheless to the local population, they would have the functions of a town.
These figures seem tiny to us.
But multiply the urban population, by present day ratios.
If you take, the population of a fifteenth century town, as a percentage of the total English population of the day, then they're not so, um, small.
Let us take Norwich, and let's say Norwich had, um, twelve thousand people.
Well multiply it by a factor of, fifteen, and we get, say hundred and sixty, hundred and eighty thousand people, in present day terMs  that would be the present day percentage for Norwich, against our global population.
Well what were the functions of these towns, of even the smallest towns.
What differentiated them from a village.
Well, in some degree, um, what towns did, um, bore a strong resemblance to what towns do today.
Except they did let_ less of it.
The range of functions of today, was probably not quite there.
But the functions they did have, they would recognise them today.
Uh, marketing and services, for even the smallest towns, in that rural economy, um, a town, or a settlement might be recognised as a town, because, the, um, weekly livestock and produce market was held there.
That meant that shops, where the travelling fairground people, or permanent shopkeepers would be there.
So country people could buy, um, all sorts of craft-made objects, um, hammers, sickles, all sorts of things.
A range of, goods which they couldn't get in their villages, or they could barter from them.
Um, services also.
The elite might consult a lawyer in the local town, just as you do today.
And there were a higher range of clergyman, and probably better educated clergyman to hear your confessions.
There were specialist functions for larger towns, many towns, um, were of course, centres of cathedrals, were cathedral towns.
Like Winchester, Gloucester, Lincoln, Norwich itself.
And, uh, other towns had military functions like Dover, which had, um, a royal castle.
And, Dover of course was a port, and by no means, the only one.
Exeter, Hull, just as today, you know, trade was important.
Shrewsbury is interesting, a sort of inland port on the Severn, um, because_ Shrewsbury, and Shropshire, because, um, wool was brought down, and traded from the Welsh mountains, in Shrewsbury.
And then the merchants would buy it and send on to London.
Um, in that, society, another feature of towns which has now escaped us, we don't notice, is the sheer concentration of population.
Even if there was only a thousand people.
Much more so it was twelve thousand or more.
Um, concentration of people into a hundred acres or more, was very unusual.
It's a stark contrast with the then normal dispersion of people over an endless countryside.
If you want real unspoiled countryside go to medieval England.
Um, in the countryside there was manufacturing.
The wool, wool manufacturing.
Weaving particularly.
But that also happened in towns.
Uh, there was a complaint, that in the fifteenth century that manufacturing was escaping the control of the town councils and guilds, and their taxes and restrictions, and moving out into the countryside.
You might say Thatcherism before the letter.
Free, unfettered industrial production.
But, nevertheless some, making of products, gloves in Oxford, for ex_ example went on.
But the wholesaling, even if goods were made in the countryside, they were brought into the towns to be sold.
Wholesale merchants, um, were, based in towns.
That was definitely an urban function.
I've just mentioned Shrewsbury in this regard.
Um, there were various factors in fifteenth century England making for a dis- prosperity, be_ declined.
Fifteenth century England was not overwhelmingly, a prosperous time for English towns.
Um, one factor making for decline, was, common to the whole of the country.
Um, the plague, general_ the Black Death, general unhealthy conditions meant that, um, people had died in England, as in the rest of western Europe.
But, the plague tended to be worse in towns, because people were co- concentrated together, as I said, in unsanitary traditions.
Um, in this depressed situation, the guilds, the trade organisations, uh, were often said to have restricted frunc_ function.
Um, A.
They limited the amount of trade that could be done.
B.
Um, guildsmen themselves so, um, often resented the burden of office-holding.
A prominent guild merchant, of un_ o_ or craftsman, had to, serve on the town council.
And that meant he had to_ there were few town council expenses, in those days.
That meant that he had to spend his own money.
Um, however, there were also religious guilds, and this is an important function of towns.
The guilds' mystery plays, the confraternities, if you wanted an elaborate religious festival, um, if you wanted elaborate array of religious services, you'd find them in the town, rather than, among the un_ very_ often usually, very poorly uneducated rural parish priest, of a village.
Who wasn't often_ not much better educated than the peasants he served.
Um, the towns, and their guilds' organisations, their town councils, tried to, promote an organic cohesiveness.
The town a spawned, a middle class.
As you might expect.
Of lawyers, priests, um, shopkeepers, merchants, which was almost totally absent from the countryside.
Where you either had gentry or peasantry.
And they endowed churches, by the fifteenth century, they, um, were patrons of schools.
The earliest English grammar schools tend to date from the, fifteenth century.
Um, they were, with the advent of the printing press, the iterate urban middle class were one of the biggest markets for books, both religious and secular.
The poems of the fifteenth century_ of the fourteenth century, sorry.
Poet Chaucer, were printed by Caxton in the late fourteen seventies, and received a wide sale.
And, we think it's the urban middle classes that start to buy it.
Um, a special word for London.
London, or rather the twin cities of London and Westminster, were so huge, it was certainly a special case.
Everything went on in London.
The Royal Court was there.
Um, abbeys, and churches of all sorts.
But, two main cathedrals.
Westminster and St.Paul.
The Parliament was held there, of course.
The city of London was_ had it's own privileges.
It was almost like an independent urban republic, headed by its lord mayor, and it contained the greatest concentration of rich merchants, in, Britain, who sent money_ who lent money to the king.
Um, the legend of Dick Whittington, the poor boy who becomes mayor of London, in the thirteen nineties.
Dick Whittington actually existed, with or without his cat.
Although he wasn't that poor.
He was a son of a, uh, a Gloucestershire knight.
Um, London was also the greatest port in the country, as it remained until very recently.
And, it was, as it remains, a national focus for the elite.
You not only went there on business.
But it was the only place, in Britain, that, you could have a range, a really big range of urban pleasures.
And the only place in Britain, where you could enjoy yourself without exciting gossip.
If you went to your local town, even to Norwich, and had a high old time, it would probably get back to, say, your mother, or your mother-in-law, in the manor house in the village, where you actually lived most of the time.
So, it's not surprising that around fifteen hundred the Scottish poet Barbour, Scottish towns were very small, um, wrote a poem to praise London, saying, 'London thou art the fleur of cities all.
' London, in fact, had a dominating position, which it doesn't really have these days.
Where, of course, over the last two hundred years, many other towns, not as big as London, but rather big cities have also grown up in Britain.
Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow in Scotland.
So, urban life was important in the fifteenth century.
But, it seems, a child, or rather undeveloped overall compared with, what we have been used to, really, for the last one hundred and fifty years."
"Uh, this talk is about uh, vernacular architecture, and development.
And i'll define both of these terms, before i start, u- talking about it.
Firstly, vernacular architecture, which means, um, it's a form of traditional construction and building.
And it's, very often taken by the community, without the help of, uh, trained professionals.
That's the basic idea behind it.
It's_ it's often called by different names.
Such as, folk building, or indigenous architecture.
But as i progress through, uh, lecture, one would get an idea of what i'm talking about.
The term development, it's_ it's a more difficult term to define_ de_ define, but that's, um, about trying to assist societies, which are in a state of transition.
And, um, and moving towards a state which is much more modern, or, well i can't define it more than that.
I can say that it, it is a form of, assistance, often given by, um, more developed countries, to countries which are defined as less developed.
Okay, now just to, just to go into the history a little bit.
And just talk about it, um, talk about the history of this whole idea of development.
And how vernacular architecture fits into this grand scheme of development.
If i may use such a term.
Is, uh, that since the Second World War, there's been a change all over the world.
Which is like, the relationship between the actual process of decolonisation, and the growth of construction activity in the developing world, has been established.
And that was the time, when many of these, uh, countries in the so called Third World, or the developing world, became independent, and became decolonized.
And, uh, this was also accompanied with the formation of international funding agencies.
Such as, the World Bank.
The International Monetary Fund, or the the United Nations Development Program.
And, uh, and many wes- western, um, aid agencies, whi- which belonged to the individual countries.
Like the United States Agency for International Development.
Or, the Overseas Development Agency of Britain.
Or, uh, CIDA of Canada, or S-I-D-A of Sweden.
And DANIDA, of Denmark, and so on.
And, with this formation also, the construction activities in the developing world has_ have accelerated.
And, uh, now just to talk about the, the_ what hap_ what was there before is that, before this, this phenomenon, the majority of the population was living in, somewhat, pre-industrial conditions.
In rural areas, without, basic infrastructure, such as, um, electricity, transportation things, or sanitation.
And, um, now there wa_ there was a change.
And w_ the first change was that very high standard, prestigious projects were built in, in some of, these countries.
And very often concentrated in their capital cities.
Very often they are called primate cities.
Which means that this, this was main, big human settlement in, in a country.
Now some of these examples, can be sited.
For example, Brasilia, in Brazil, was an entirely new city, and very, very prestigious, and, uh, really amazingly, expensive buildings.
So, built in Brasilia in, the sixties.
Or Chandigahr, in India, which was designed by a Swiss architect, Le Corbusier.
And entirely built from scratch.
And again, with very, very prestigious national buildings.
And, um, now the implications of such projects are, are two-fold.
Firstly it signaled the beginning on dependence, on imported ways of doing things.
Imported standards, imported materials, techniques.
And also dependence on skilled manpower, or ski_ professional expertise.
And secondly, and probably more harmfully, this, um, development of high standards, in western-based local institutions.
It led to the neglect of local, indigenous ways of doing things.
Local, materials, local knowledge and techniques.
And, um, at the same time, there was no serious effort, to, integrate such projects it's_ with, uh, overall national planning and economic strategies.
And this resulted in something which is quite familiar to all of us.
It resulted in un_ unbalanced organization.
Very, very large cities without any kind of coherence.
Or_ and increasing unemployment, and even underemployment.
Uncontrolled urban growth.
Lag between demand and supply of housing.
Many, many people became homeless in the, developing world.
And, and on top of it, the most well-known problem is, the burden of foreign loans.
Now, this was, this was 'til the sixties, and, and then by the nineteen-seventies, there began to be criticisms of these, uh, these, uh, ways of doing things.
This, this whole idea of building prestigious projects, and getting national identity through, um, the foreign-led, uh, notions of development.
And this, again, paradoxically, this, this criticism, came mainly from western scholars, and researchers.
And, i could give some examples.
For example, um, there was a book in nineteen sixty-four, published.
It was called <em>Architecture without Architects</em>.
It was by an American author called Bernard Rudofsky, which set off things.
But there were many, people, and, and some of these titles reflect ideas such as, <em>Unconscious Design</em>, by Christopher Alexander.
<Em>Shelter and Society</em>, author is Paul Oliver.
<Em>Freedom to Build</em>, and <em>Housing by People</em>, John Turner.
I'm naming all these, because, uh, from these titles you get an idea that, people were trying to understand that, uh_ or beginning to understand that there, there was a lot of local, and, um, indigenous knowledge, which, uh, these, uh, a_ approaches were a- avoiding, or neglecting.
And because of, these criticisms this, this postcolonial development, slowed down.
And it slowed down temporarily, with the advent of what was called the self-help, school of thought.
Which actually promoted, uh, a new era.
Of low technology, using very, very simple ideas.
It was often called, appropriate technology.
Which which meant that the technology should be tuned in to local conditions.
Community-based, or, or, self-help, experimental projects.
Many of these were built all over the developing world at that time.
And this was mainly in the seventies.
And these... These were built, because the international aid agencies, the ones i mentioned.
Such as the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Program.
They began to be influenced by these criticisMs  and this started a whole series of projects, which are known as site, and services projects.
Which, essentially means, that, providing people with sites, for building houses.
And some basic services.
Such as water supply, and some form of sanitation.
Then allowing people to build their own housing.
On the own.
With their own knowledge, and their own skills.
And, um, well there were several other streams within this.
Such as squatter upgrading.
That means that people who live in, squatter settlements in the developing world.
They would_ they will upgrade it.
And then there were low-cost sanitation projects.
Again, uh, just using what i m- mentioned.
As i mentioned.
Appropriate technologies, to, to improve living conditions for people.
And these were built in many, many parts of the, uh, developing world.
And, this just spanned from say, Sanaa, in Yemen, to Jakarta in Indonesia.
And, and all over the, um, all over Latin America, and Africa.
And, and many of these projects are built.
And, i, i, won't get into how effective these projects were.
But, i should just say that, this change, it signifies a departure from pro- providing products, like the ones i talked about.
And, instead it ha- had ch- changed to an idea of developing local capacities, local institutions.
And even then, finally, many of, many of these projects failed.
Even though the intention is very good.
And basic- basically, just to say that more_ many research findings suggest that such development did not reach a significant section of society.
Even though there was the intention to actually help them."
"This talk, uh, actually, um, focuses on, what is, what can be termed as, the type of, uh, local building, or indigenous building according to physiographic, regions of Bangladesh.
I should define what physiographic, means.
In very simple terms it means the, the elevation or, or the height of land.
And that, that is a, a geographical condition, on which this n- housing is often built.
And this actually leads to different types of climatic, or micro-climatic or_ conditions available to have local resources.
And this is what i'll talk about here.
The first, physiographic zone, in Bangladesh_ there are many physiographic jones- actually zones.
There are actually twenty-four physiographic zones.
But, I should talk about, three of the main types.
The first type is what is known as the plains land.
And, more than seventy percent of the land of  Bangladesh belongs to it.
And this, this land has been built over successive periods.
Very, very long, successive periods of, what is known alluvial sedimentation.
Which is, um, through land formed by uh silt, brought by rivers.
And, in, in the form of what is known as a huge delta.
Bangladesh is probably one of the largest delta in the_ deltas in the world.
And, more than seventy percent of the land is very flat.
And, and, it, it is known as the plains land.
Now this land, because it's flat.
And, because of the predominance of rivers in the landscape, it is subject to, annual flooding.
And especially near large rivers and coastal areas.
And a lot of the agriculture, is adapted to that form of flooding.
And it is very typical, and people have learned how to live with that.
Now in this particular area, for building houses, bamboo is the main building material.
It is very, very widely grown, very common.
And, um, even though things are changing nowadays, bamboo is getting a bit more sc_ scarce th-, scarce than it used to be in previous years.
But, there are two types of bamboo.
One is the thick-walled, or very strong poles, for building uh structural members.
Posts, for example, or, uh, roof rafters.
And the second type, is the thin-walled bamboo.
Which is plaited and woven into a variety of, mats, for making walls.
A very, very stiff type of wall.
So these are the two main types of, uh, u_ two main uses of bamboo, and it is the main building material.
In some places, uh these bamboo mats, mats walls are plastered with mud.
And this is known as wattle and daub.
The wattle and daub technique.
And for ex__ for example, in, in another part of the country.
An, and it's called Sylhet, which is, which is an area with very, very high rainfall.
Probably among the highest rainfall in the whole world.
Uh, bamboo is split into, uh, sections.
And they're very closely placed, and plastered with mud.
And, and it has a very substantial frame inside.
So, because of the heavy rainfall, if the outside mud plastering gets washed off, the substantial frame is there, and can be repaired very easily.
So, y- you see how, um, this kind of building, or architecture is just tuned to local conditions.
And how it just depends on local resources.
And how it responds to local climate.
In some areas there are m_ m_ buildings with mud, earthen buildings.
If the site is well drained, and if it, doesn't get very flooded.
And if suitable soil is available.
But this is not very common.
In the plains land most of the, uh_ most of the soil that is available is clayey, and which is not very good for building houses.
Because, once it dries it tends to, uh, develop cracks.
Um, there are various other organ_ organic building materials.
Such as, different types of reeds, rushes, jute sticks, which, which are the stems of the plant jute, which is one of the major agricultural products in Bangladesh.
Various types of thatching materials, fibrous thatching materials.
A remarkable thatching material can be mentioned.
Which grows in the southern delta, it's called golpatta, which literally means &quot;round leaf.
&Quot; it's a, round leaf palm tree, and, um, it, uh, it is used for making very, very, uh, remarkable looking roofs.
That's the first type.
The second type of land in the physiographic division of Bangladesh is a terraced land.
It's known_ and this land is at a slightly higher elevation.
A lot of it, belongs to what is known as the Pleistocene Uplands which was_ which belonged to an earlier period, when the delta_ before the delta was totally formed.
And, um, this land is further away from the sea course, because, subsequent land formation, meant that it became further, and further away from the coast.
And thi_ this land is also above the normal flood level.
Because it was_ it, uh, it consolidated at an earlier time.
And, um, and in this area, i- it has got a very specific type of soil.
The soil is lateritic, which means that it, it has an iron, uh, content in it.
And it ha_ it has, i- it is very hard and strong, and less clayey.
And this allows for building with this, this local soil.
And the remarkable examples, of mud houses, or earthen houses in this area.
Sometimes you see very, very large two-storied houses, built with locally available mud.
And there're two types of construction with mud, in this area.
First is, building with very large ea- earth blocks, very very large blocks wh- which are just placed side by side, and then, you know, plastered.
Or, the other technique which is kno_ known as the layering technique.
Or building in stages by hand pressing.
What is known, in Britain as, uh packed earth c_ packed earth construction, or cob construction.
So, uh, that's the second type.
Then there're other types of, uh, mud construction.
For example, wattle and daub, which i mentioned earlier.
The building uh lattice framework, and then plastering it with mud.
And there're also types of housing.
Bamboo houses, like in the plains, also coexist in, in the terraced land.
The third, uh, physiographic zone, are the hilly areas.
And they're not too many hilly areas in Bangladesh.
It's mostly flat.
But there're some hilly areas in the south-east, which is known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts and there're some of the scattered hilly areas.
But, the hills are very low, uh, it, the hi_ the tallest, tallest hill there.
Or the highest hill there is a_ less than three hundred meters.
And, in the hills the communities who live in the hills are tribal.
And, and they have a very, very specific tradition and culture, of their own.
And their houses are built on bamboo or timber stilts.
Which is the very, very specific type of housing.
And it is done to position the houses, in the hilly and uneven terrains_ terrain.
So, that, you know, they can adapt it.
But also to protect against wild animals.
Uh, because, uh, in the hilly areas there're also a lot of forests.
And it is, um, it uh, the houses are built on stilts to protect against snakes and, and panthers, and, animals.
And, um, in these stilted houses, the hous_ the houses have, uh, floors made out of bamboo, or timber.
Almost like platforms, which serve as floors.
And, um, very often_ because, as i mentioned, because there are forests nearby, there is a supply of natural and organic building materials.
And they are widely available, and they're predominantly used in the housing in this area.
In the hilly, in the hilly areas also there are, there are also mud buildings.
And houses_ and in some cases houses made entirely of timber.
Again, because of the availability of local resources.
Just to conclude, and talking about these three regions.
One_ the one really has to say, that, that the, the description which i gave right now i- i- is what has_ had been done traditionally.
It is still being done, but things are changing rapidly.
Um, communities in many of these areas are unable to follow many of these traditional building practices, and they have to adapt, or change because of changing environmental and social conditions."
"Well, now that I've talked about, um, the whole background, and, um, given, given some ways, of doing things.
And approaches, and, and specific types of, uh, construction activities.
Now, I'll go into a few examples.
But, before I do, do that, I should say that, um, i, though I have been focusing on the developing world in general.
I should mention that in the, so called, developed world.
There are huge communities who are underdeveloped.
And I sh_ I'll just use two of these examples to say that even with them, this, this whole idea of development and vernacular architecture, it, it applies.
The first example is, um, the Eskimos in, Nor- North America.
And, and they lived a_ what was conventionally known as the igloo.
But, uh, and that was their vernacular architecture.
But now, in, in the recent past.
And ov_ especially over the last thirty years or so, igloos have been replaced by frame houses.
And which is_ which is one of the kind of, uh, things i_ I've been trying to talk about.
This whole notion of, mm, mm, development, if I may.
If, if it is development.
And, and at the beginning I had mentioned that I cannot define this term development very clearly.
Because, what is meant as development, may not actually lead to very positive results.
And they- the Eskimos, um, actually really illustrate that.
They have actually_ the Eskimos have been drawn into a national commercial, commercial economy, due to the expansion of the petroleum industry in, in North America.
This is one of the main, uh, reasons why they have changed.
Otherwise they would have been left alone, and they would have been a very traditional, vernacular, settlement in a community.
And_ but this ha- hasn't been so.
And, um, their, uh, harpoon, husky sleds, and igloo, they have all been replaced by, things like, rifles, Ski-Doos [brand of snowmobile], and, and frame houses.
Now, just to talk about the frame house, which is a replacement of the igloo.
The igloo was actually very, very comfortable.
And, and very well-tuned to, the local climate, and local context.
Now with the frame house, it_ because it was built on permafrost, it began to lose heat through the floor.
And, and hence many of them, have very, very cold interiors.
I mean this is, this is the kind of house which, which have be_ has been built all over North America.
But it_ one can see how cli- climatically unsuitable it is, for, um, the, the area where the Eskimos, Eskimos live.
And then, this uh permafrost, it also melts during, uh during the summer season.
And it_ this melting permafrost cause subsidence of these houses.
And, so that's the other problem with these frame houses.
And, igloos never had such problems to begin with.
And, and then, the other th_ resource, timber.
Timber is the main resource to build frame houses, have to be brought in, from, other parts of the United States.
Because, in, in the North there isn't such a huge supply of such timber for building, uh, houses.
And_ which means that there's this whole embodied energy cost in, in transporting these, uh, materials from, very, very long distances.
It's not only the energy of producing such materials, but the energy of transporting them.
And the cost is also very high.
Not in_ not only in terms of money.
But in terms of the environment really.
And then, there's of course there's_ because of like I mentioned, because of the, the cold interiors, there is this increased heating cost.
And very often the f_ the right kind of fuel is not available and, and they have to do it with kerosene.
And, which is also quite expensive for Eskimos.
And, as_ and to_ like I said, because of bringing in this timber, there's this uh embodied energy cost, and basically, to build a frame house in, Alaska for example, costs double that of houses in the southern United States.
And, and the north of the United States is still underdeveloped.
And it lacks, job opportunities, especially in the modern sector.
And, and there's_ at the same time there's this whole, no- decline of the indigenous culture.
And there's this lack of appropriate development of, of their culture.
And perhaps more than half, possibly, of the Eskimo population they're on welfare now.
This is one example.
Or again, another example.
And again from the so called developed world, the Australian Aborigines.
And if you look at their traditional activities, they had a very, very different form of housing.
They- their activities usually (xx) take outside the dwelling unit.
But they had, what, what was_ what is known as a homestead.
Which was a defined area within which people lived.
But not necessarily within the house.
And now, there is this whole idea about the Australian uh state, the government, to provide permanent housing to them.
Many of them were nomads and pastoralists, and they travelled over the terrain for, uh, most of the year.
And now they're r- resettled_ resettled with an inverted comma.
I should use such a word.
Um, and there are major problems with the state-provided permanent housing.
For example, Aborigines had a different relationship between, like I said, the outside and the inside.
And it's, it's very different from a conventional house, where the relationship is defined by the house itself, and not by people and their own choice.
And then there, because, of this permanent housing, they were unable to relocate to alter the house to suit specific needs.
Social needs, or environmental conditions.
They, they were just unable to do that.
Which they could do formally.
And, um, then they were very often unable to cope with many of the technical devices provided in the houses.
Such as, air-conditioning, and heating.
Because they, were not used to living like that, and this, this whole idea of, living was just superimposed on them.
And often they did_ they didn't have enough jobs, or the money for servicing and repair of such technical devices.
And, of course, the traditional ways of doing things had_ just had to be abandoned.
Traditional methods of hygiene, cooking, eating, they could not be followed, really, in these, in these new houses they were provided.
And, the final result was the fragmentation of, you know, this, personality, their personal spaces.
Their loss of identity, and they had to adopt lifestyles of the mainstream white Australians.
Okay, now that I've given two examples from the developed world.
I should talk about an example from the developing world which, which is the main concern of this lecture.
But, i, i, should talk about, uh, a project which was done in Turkey, after the 1970 earthquake in Gediz, in Turkey.
Um, what was done is that, uh, to re- resettle people who had lost their homes in, in the earthquake, they were provided what was known as polyurethane igloos.
Igloos made out of, um, synthetic materials.
And this was designed, professionally, by, uh, the chemical company Behr, in Germany.
And, um, wh_ what was done, and I cannot des_ describe these houses in too much detail, without any images.
But, just to say that they were, uh, curved, and they looked like igloos, and domical [dome-shaped] really.
And, and, people were resettled in this.
And, uh, what di_ what did happen is that many of these communities or households when they started living in these houses.
They immediately started changing, and adapting these houses.
Many of them didn't use those houses.
And they just built regular houses_ their own type of houses right next to it.
And used the igloos, as, you know, store houses, or, to keep chickens, or staples.
And they didn't want to live in them, because it was culturally, socially, and climatically inappropriate.
This type of house, was also very, very dangerous in fire.
It could just go up i, in flames in a minute, if there was a fire.
So it was also hazardous.
But, again, you know, we when, when we talk about this type of housing, we can be very, very, um, critical of them.
Because i- it's a paternalistic way of doing things that, people from the so-called west, like organisations like Behr, think that they know how to, design buildings for people who live in Turkey, without really understanding their culture or their context.
And, and thinking that it would work.
Well after that, then the, the Government of Turkey actually tried to provide permanent housing.
And this I can talk about it, it pertains to the idea of, um, the, the National Modern, if I may.
And they tried to build housing which was kind of, a bit more modern, and wasn't traditional.
But, uh, they gave them free.
And this was inappropriate to_ again inappropriate to local lifestyles.
And one of the main problems is wa_ it was that the government assumed that most of the families were, nuclear.
And very often, uh, modelled on western families.
But most of those families were not nuclear.
They were peasant families, and they were of extended type.
And_ which meant that many of them had to overcrowd in, in these houses.
Or they had to break up the family, and just spread them over in different houses, which was very, very inappropriate, really.
And some of these houses, they lacked some of the basic components of traditional houses.
Most traditional Turkish houses in that area, had what was called a salon, or a reception space.
Which was a kind of transitional zone, where people maintained their privacy, and, yet they could meet, guests, and receive them, and then decide to let_ lead them on to the interior of the house.
And because of the lack of this, this particular space.
Many of these hou- households had to build extensions.
Which kind of dealt with this kind of transition, of, outsiders to the inside.
Then there were various other adaptations_ that they had to build screens for privacy.
And especially many of the toilet and bathing spaces were not that private.
And, that they had to really screen them off.
And, and these additions actually made the houses more vulnerable to future earthquakes.
Many of these, uh, houses, were designed_ most of these houses were designed to be earthquake-resistant.
But, the changes that people made, just, you know, took away from, they detracted from that whole ideal.
And, essentially the best thing would have probably been to, give people money, and also some building materials, and let them build on their own.
They could have built much cheaper.
Culturally, and climatically, perhaps, much more effective.
And there were local skills that they_ it could be done.
But, this is just a very, very classic example of u- paternalistic, patronising mode of helping people, help themselves."
"Well now that we have, uh, talked about the background, and the history of, uh, this whole practice of, um, development within vernacular settlements.
I- I should talk a, a little bit about what I referred to previously.
The self-help school of thought that, emerged in the nineteen seventies.
Um, which was essentially_ again I should refer to it, was, was a criticism or a reaction, against previous ways of, of very, um, modern and_ well, somewhat, imposing ways of doing things.
Now, because of these_ th_ this, um, uh, this new school.
This self-help school, there are two different manifestations of these approaches, or the seventies.
And, and it had just changed in two different streaMs  and, had had two different effects really.
The first, effect is that this whole idea of vernacular architecture, it has, it has become very popular.
And it has gained currency in, what, what is known as the post-modernist, um, discourse in the west.
And I should talk a little bit about the post-modernist discourse.
And not, not again in fe_ in a lot of detail.
But the feel of architecture in the fifties and sixties, the kind of stuff that was built.
And lot of us know that it- it's kind of very boxy.
And they called it the International Style, or the Modernist Style.
And, it had changed in the, in the seventies onwards.
And 'specially in the eighties.
And the kind of stuff that was built, it was known as postmodernist.
Which actually referred to the history of societies where they built these kind of buildings.
And also, the_ a lot of it was, irony, wit, or criticism of modernism.
And, um, and vernacular architecture fitted in with this discourse, very much so.
Because it, it referred to history.
It had actually, referred to a sense of time and place.
So, this was the first effect.
And the second effect was um, the_ well this was in the western part of the world.
In the west.
And th_ and the second effect was in the, in the so called developed world.
And there it became fashionable to revive traditional and indigenous materials and techniques.
And these, were again, the postcolonial societies which I mentioned in the first part of this lecture.
And, um, many of_ this, this is called a form of u- revivalism, histori- historicism.
Terms like these can be used.
But basically it means that people were looking for an identity within their own traditional setting.
And, probably this is_ this is_ well_ well common in many other fields, not only in architecture, but... Ways (xx xx), or, um, language, literature and then so on.
But in architecture this was_ this was very much followed.
And_ and for example, this is exemplified by the work of an Egyptian architect.
His name is Hassan Fathy, and I should mention his name, because he was very seminal i_ in this kind of movement.
Hassan Fathy was this architect, who was trained in the west.
But he was, very much influenced by this whole research and self_ the self-help school of s- thought in the seventies.
And he went back to Egypt, and he totally revived indigenous ways of building_ with mud, with mud blocks.
And_ and tried to train local builders how to_ how to just uh retain some of the traditional techniques.
But use them instead of the more improved ways.
And, and this is one of the best examples, really.
But, this whole idea of revivalism which I'm talking about.
It has, it has also very negative effects.
For example, many of these countries, because of this whole_ m- well, trying to revive traditional ways of doing things.
But not really understanding tradition.
Had result in very incongruous and grotesque buildings.
Which, which were kind of (xx) of um, traditional ways of doing things.
But almost like, like mockery of, of what was there in the past.
Even though seeing the_ talking about these two, uh, different manifestations of these two discourses.
One in the west, and one in the east.
Which he moved from, uh, the nineteen-seventies self-help school of thought.
There_ there are parallels between these two, um, with these two discourses, if I may use the word.
On, on the basis of this whole common concern for heritage and tradition.
And, but saying that, it, it, it still_ there's this, um, parallel between these two discourse in the west and the east.
And it is still somewhat superficial.
Because it ignores the basic um, differences_ the disparities between these two, uh, two_ these two contexts of these two_ universes if I may even use such a strong word.
For example in the west, this was a reaction which was_ which resulted from disenchantment with the cold efficiency of the modern movement.
Everything was kind of very systematic in the modern movement.
And, and, and human beings were reduced to, um, objects really.
And, and this had led to the search for uh- a way to restore a sense of identity, place, humanity, even witticism was accompanied by this kind of, you know, need.
And, on the other hand, well no, there- there's a bit more to it, though.
I sh- I should say that also in the west.
And especially in many Scandinavian countries, this low population growth had led architects and planners, who were previously involved in large-scale public housing, school programs, and, and, new towns.
A lot of these had been built in, for example, Britain.
They, they had less work because of w- less demand, because there was hardly any population to consume, such, such buildings.
So, they had to turn to activities of conservation, or restoration.
Basically, using old buildings, a_ and, and trying to use_ adapt them to new uses.
Thi_ it's often called adaptive reuse.
And, very often, some of these projects involve renewing historic city centres.
And, so it was a different stream.
But, but in the countries, like, which were grappling with, you know, rapid population growth, like in the developing world.
Um, they- there was a huge shortfall of housing, which was just the opposite.
A shortfall of housing, education, employment, and, and so on.
And architects had to be driven by other imperatives, to consider, you know, architectural imperative.
So, there was this very, very basic difference.
So, for, for, such architects in, in the developing world the_ there was this practical, technical necessity for, using very very meager resource in very optimal ways.
Using available materials and skills instead of just continuously relying on imported materials.
Again, this is fitting into this whole stream of revivalist self-help way of doing things.
And, and, and this_ this basically put demands on architects.
And most of buildings_ mot_ most of building which are, um, low-cost and, uh, well, as I used the word before in the first lecture, appropriate to the local context.
Climatalogically, and ecologically appropriate, really.
Then they are, self-reliant.
That they_ they can be done, within, local context, by local people.
And less dependent on imported materials and skills.
Again, to_ to conserve very very limited foreign currency, many of these countries had.
And, on these grounds the architect in the so-called, poor_ developing countries, or postcolonial societies, um, if I may use the word.
Is now impelled to study his own traditional architecture.
Which in the past had resulted in very, very suitable, perhaps not perfect, but, uh, very, very habitable, built environments.
Usually endowed with authentic culture richness.
And, I could name a few examples as I mentioned Hassan Fathy, but, for example, the architect Charles Correa, in India.
He could_ he can be mentioned.
And his work_ he calls it_ it's an_ it's an architecture which is sensitive to the climate.
And he uses the term 'form of architecture, follows climate'.
Then there's the, um, well he's English.
Originally from uh Germany, Otto Konigsberger.
He was dedicated to the training of alternative type of architects.
Who were capable of encouraging environmentally, sensitive architecture, and coping with the emerging urban reality.
Otto Konigsberger, actually taught in the Architecture Association School in in England, in London and, uh, which, which actually has dealt with training architects from the developing part of the world to actually learn about doing very, very sensitive architecture in their own countries.
Then there's the name of Geoffrey Bawa in Sri Lanka, which I can mention.
And he had a very similar committed mission to, develop an architecture which is very very much in tune with the local context.
Or, the Turkish architect, Sedad Eldem, and he, he was searching for a modern identity for the the traditional Turkish house, because their societies had changed, and they were going for a new modern way of thinking.
But at the same time, the_ he was looking for a way to marry this modern, se_ uh, modern search for identity with the traditional ways of doing things.
Or the architect Muzharul Islam in Bangladesh, and he was trying to develop an architectural expression, which was reliant upon whatever limited resources they had, in that country.
And, and the technology which was affordable.
But saying that, these- pioneers_ these are pioneers actually.
But they are marginal.
And, um, and because they were very sensitive to the changes that were happening globally.
They tried to find ways to deal and adapt with these changes.
But, very often, most architects were actually driven by necessities of commerce, and, and, and they had to compromise many of their ideals.
So, in many parts of the developing world, you see buildings which are anonymous, they could fit in, in any part of the world.
And so, there's this whole change.
And this_ and the developing world is now faced with a very, very strong challenge to adapt ideas which were pioneered by certain people."
"Okay.
Now to follow on from the previous lecture.
Um, we have talked firstly about the history, of, uh, vernacular architecture in the developing world, in the context of, mm, development.
But now, I should, uh, an- and I just focused and narrowed down, to a certain movement which emerged in the nineteen seventies, and its effects.
And the different challenges it presented to architects in, in the developing world.
But now I should talk, a little bit, about the different types of... Different types of uh construction that, that, these movements, these changes had produced in the developing world.
And, um, this, this would actually give an idea uh, of, of the results of, the changes that I had been describing in the previous lectures.
Now, and i, I'll refer to four categories of, uh, construction activity in the developing world.
And, um, for_ and this has been formulated by, what is known as the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, UNIDO.
And, and so I'm referring to a report.
But, i, I'll describe these categories.
Firstly, the first category, is what is known as the International Modern.
That includes, very prestigious public buildings, based on in- international standards, and personal.
Now this I talked about at the beginning.
Right at the beginning, after the, the emergence of new independent countries in the developed, uh, developing world.
There was this whole, you know, uh, resurgence of... Building, uh... Whole_ a resurgence of, uh, uh, doing things in, in a way derived from the west.
And, um, it included, very, very, large buildings.
And i, I gave some examples at that time, of buildings in Brazil, for example, Brasilia.
Or, Chandigarh, in India.
Islamabad in Pakistan, or Abuja in Nigeria, an- and so on.
There are many of these, followed what was known as the International Modern Style, or [dash] a modern form of construction.
Then there was_ there is the other one, which is the National Modern.
Which is basically a scaled-down version of the International Modern.
Which with_ uh, which had simpler technical needs.
But, it was confined mainly to national expertise.
Local architects could, design it.
Local builders could, build it.
It relied on local materials.
For example, the previous one, International Modern, most of the materials like steel, glass, and, you know many other building materials, were imported.
But in the National Modern they tried to use whatever could be locally produced.
Modern materials, but locally produced.
Such as, brick, or concrete blocks, things like that.
Then the third, is what is known as Intermediate Technology, and uh, this is, largely based on what I described earlier as the self-help school of thought.
And the, the whole idea of intermediate technology I should, I should mention a little bit about the name of E.
F.
Uh, Schumacher, who coined the term.
And he wrote this book in the seventies, known as, Small is Beautiful.
Which was, which was basic_ basically a criticism of the modern, modernist way of doing things.
And as I mentioned in the previous talk which led to the whole idea of self-help.
And, uh, the intermediate technol_ technology is largely based on low-technology, self-help, community participation, te_ terms like that.
Which, which people could do by themselves.
But again, it was a slight improvement on what could be built locally, on local expertise, and local ways of doing things.
It was an attempt to improve things, in ways which was locally achievable.
Then the fourth one is, um, the Traditional Construction Sector, which, uh, which intermediate technology, actually tries to improve upon.
And this is evident mostly in informal urban settlements.
And, and very o_ em_ and very often in rural areas.
Most people build on their own, wi_ in traditional ways, using local builders who are not trained in a professional or formal way.
And this is characterised by local skills, and indigenous building materials, and techniques.
This is also often known as Vernacular Architecture.
And this had, been continuing for time_ time immemorial really.
Now in the first, two categories.
Um, the International Modern, and the National Modern, uh, and also to some extent the third.
Uh, there was this overriding factor, that it depended on uh western standards.
W- western technology and expertise.
Paradoxically intermediate technology was also western led.
Even though it was a criticism of previous, uh, methods of doing things.
And it tried to be much more sensitive to local ways.
But, very often, it was an idea of uh western, uh, professionals, coming in, to the developed world_ developing world an- and teaching people how to improve their own thing.
Which is a bit of a paradox really.
But on the other hand, I mean this is definitely better than the first two.
The_ the_ especially, the International Modern.
And many cases have shown that these imported materials and techniques, have inflicted very serious damage to local economies.
Paying very, very high prices for these materials, which actually only serve the purpose of status, and prestige.
And, uh, and this had also_ this whole_ it led to a form of dependency.
And this dependency syndrome has also proved to be, a major constraint to local institutional building.
And people were, um, aiming for_ striving, and aspiring for this, this modern, international way of doing things.
And, um, because of this, very very dramatic changes are needed u- to, to, bring in improvements in institutional infrastructure, for example.
Or, um, well particularly the improvement of financial institutions, that can actually provide people with assistance, so that they can build houses on their own, without having to, you know, depend on, external agencies to come and give them grant houses.
Or, mechanisms to increase the availability of credit.
For example, it has been done in, in a project.
And I should talk about it a little bit.
In Bangladesh, which is the (xx) Bank Housing Project, which started providing credit to very, very, poor people in villages to build their own houses.
Uh, and they had the choice of building on their own, in what_ in ways they wanted to, without having to depend on other agencies coming in from outside, and building houses from them, and giving them as grants.
And making them dependent on loans.
Uh, mak_ making them dependent on external fi_ funding.
And, um, to go back to the, the notion of the_ of intermediate technology.
And one of the main reasons for failure, had been that while extensive research had been undertaken on say innovative, ways of building designs, techniques and so on.
And even there was a lot of lip service on involving the local community.
Very little attention was paid to local processes, and users.
And_ which is often known as the target group by_ by, uh, these organisations who believe in appropriate technology, or intuitive technology.
The term target group can be questioned.
That this was a group, for which a certain idea was tailored and just applied.
And very often, even though they were involved in doing things on their own, this was much more at the tails end of the project."
"This, this lecture, is, uh, going to describe and talk about, a certain research project.
Which, which deals with, um, efforts of agencies to provide housing to very, very low income rural, uh, communities the_ in the developing world.
And, and, uh, the case, uh, for carrying out this research has been chosen as, as Bangladesh, as, as a country case study.
Now, to begin with the basis of the study, uh, was, um_ there were two main basises.
First is, that it, it actually wanted to fill in the gap, in knowledge, or, or discourse in this particular field of... Architecture in, in the developing world.
And, the gap is, that firstly, if you_ if one goes through literature- current literature, the_ one notices that there is a great emphasis on urban areas.
And a lot of studies on urban housing, urban environmental change and, and so on.
But, very little on the rural areas.
And, and, this is because, many of, many of the urban areas, cities in, in the developing world have been growing very, very rapidly.
And, and, uh, it is, it is almost like, a fear or, or, a paranoia that many of these settlements are just going like, out of control.
And that is why the_ all these studies are focused on the urban area.
But, saying that, the majority of the population.
The_ in the developing world, and probably even in the whole world, still live in rural areas.
Probably up to sixty percent of the population, of the world, live in rural areas.
And, and even saying that, there's, there's, there's very little study on, on the housing conditions of rural communities.
And, um, that is why this, this study, this research_ wanted to provide, provide an insight, and a knowledge in, in this, in this, in this aspect of, the field.
Secondly, now taking this country case study, which I mentioned, Bangladesh.
It was seen that, many organisations were working there.
And many of them were working in rural areas.
But of course, without the benefit of, uh, knowledge.
Or, or, um, studies, done in the_ in that field.
But- because of the same reason which i mentioned before, that there hadn't been many studies done in this field really.
And, and, because of, these projects being built, a lot of them were built somewhat in an (xx) fashion.
Very often as, as responses to crisises.
Which i'll mention later.
But, um, there's, there's a lack of, evaluation of many of these efforts.
And this is what this study, uh, this research wanted to do.
It was mainly a form of evaluation, of these efforts of organisations or agencies, to provide housing for very, very low-income populations.
And that is why the, the study, the name of the study is, it's a study of agency intervention, in this field.
Saying that, now, i, should mention a little bit about low-income communities.
What, what are low-income communities.
What, what do they really face.
What are their problems.
And i believe that the problems are the same, all over the world.
Not only in the developing world.
But even the developed world, for poor communities_ face some very, very typical impediments.
And these impediments, especially in building housing for themself [themselves].
The first one, and which is the most basic and rudimentary, is financial resource constraints.
They don't have enough money to build houses.
This is quite clear.
They are_ they don't have enough money to afford, uh, renting, or, um_ yes, for renting or finding housing for themselves.
And_ but the financial resource concerns not only means getting mo_ uh, uh, is money.
But also the assets to generate money.
For example, land.
Many communities in the developing world, especially, uh, depend on agriculture.
And if they do not have land, they cannot generate enough money.
And you cannot generate money, the, the, housing situation gets affected.
So that's the first f- constraint they face.
The second constraint they face, consistently, and all over the world, is their vulnerability to, hazards.
Natural and man-made.
And, um, and to deviate a little bit from the developing world.
I should just mention that i should give an example of, the Australian Aborigines that, um_ there was one situation when they, they had, they were not able to hear, flood warnings, because the radio channels that they could reach, did not broadcast those warnings.
So they were just inundated by floods.
But, of course, th- that happened, because they were very, very poor.
And then they_ it's, it's their special condition of poverty which makes them vulnerable to hazards.
And all over the developing world the poor people suffer much, much more.
And all over the world, you see the poorer countries suffer much, much more from natural, and man-made disasters.
And the third one, is, what is less documented.
But, uh, which is known in, uh, general, general discussions and ideas of people.
Is, is the natural resource constraint.
Is that, very often, in, many parts of the world, and even in the developed world.
People used before, and, uh, previously people used to build with naturally available building resources.
For example, different kinds of grasses and reeds, for thatching roofs.
Or mud for building houses, or walls and, and, things like that.
Now these materials have become very, very difficult to, find.
And for example, if you look at the_ if_ at Britain, you see there is_ to build a thatch house is much, much more expensive than a conventional house.
And, of course, in the developing world, if i can give the example of the country case study.
Which is the focus of this study.
Um, the price of bamboo, which is one of the main building materials in that country.
Almost sixty percent of the houses, use bamboo, in some form of the other.
Um, the price of bamboo had gone up, uh, uh, threefold in the decade between nineteen eighty and nineteen ninety.
And so, this of course, presents a very, very serious impediment in_ o- on, low-income communities, who have to depend on locally available natural building resources.
But, if, if they become harder to find.
If they become more expensive, then their housing suffers.
Okay.
Now the, the study what it do_ did was, that it had tried to, understand the context, of Bangladesh, and it decided to define certain aspects of the setting.
Or the context, and the characteristics of the context.
The first one was, identified as urban growth.
There was a very, very rapid urban growth in Bangladesh.
There still is, and it's b_ and the main city, called Dhaka, it's the capital city.
And, it has been found that it is now, the world's fastest growing urban ce_ urban conurbation it might be called.
Or, fastest growing city.
Um, six point six percent, per year.
That's the growth rate.
And it is_ it's among the highest in the world.
And, and at the same time, and because of this growth.
But also previously, there's been an urban bias in national policy.
Most of the investment, and financial institutions were, uh, in, in the main city.
And this is again, if i, m- may say, like, this is what is known as a primate city.
Or a city which is, defined as larger than it's_ the population.
The population of the city is larger than double, of the, next largest city.
And it is known as to pri_ known as a primate city.
And primate cities are common all over the developing world.
And Dhaka is, is, no exception.
And there's been a great bias in, in the kind of, construction activity, development activity, uh, and, and all that.
And this urban growth, and this whole bias has led to dependence on rural areas for, for all kinds of resources, manpowers, and, and so on.
And this has led to the depletion of, resources in rural areas.
For example, just to give a little example that, um, bamboo, as i mentioned before, uh, is used for building rural houses.
But in the urban areas, it's, it's used as scaffolding to build very, um, tall buildings.
High rise apartments, and, and things like that.
And, and all of this bamboo, for scaffolding, comes in from the rural areas.
So, basically, this, this leads to the depletion of that particular building resource, and rural communities are unable to, buy it.
Because i- it- it's_ the price is very, very competitive.
And there's the need for it in urban areas.
And urban areas can, afford to pay more for such a resource.
Okay.
The second aspect of this context, is the whole idea of land, or income distribution.
And when one goes through the statistics.
The statistics_ it, it does seem that it is very asymmetrical, or very, very uneven.
So, a small amount of people have a lot of money, or own a lot of land.
And, and a large amount of people, have very little money.
Or have very little assets, such as land.
And, just, just to give a little example.
It has been estimated that in rural areas of Bangladesh, sixty percent of the population own ten percent of the land.
And ten percent of the population, own sixty percent of the land.
So, this is the kind of figure that we are looking at.
So, this is another characteristic of the context.
It's, it's a very uneven, form of resource distribution.
Then the third aspect of the context, is this whole, um, emergence of what is known as international development aid.
Or international aid or assistance, often given in the form of loans.
Not only as grants.
And, um, this, this has led to a form of def- dependence.
And there's a lot of literature on, you know, how the, developing world is dependent on the developed world for, for, international aid and assistance.
But, there's another side to it.
There's_ that is what might, might be termed as the politics of aid.
Very often aid is given, as, as a tied condition.
Okay.
For example, a country might give a poorer country, money in order to build a bridge.
But most of the materials for building the bridge, and the, the expertise, and the professionals, all come from the developed world.
The country who gives the aid.
So essentially, a lot of the money which is given, for development, actually goes back the_ to the country which has given money, the donor.
This is one of the politics of aid.
Very often, it has been seen, that much of the aid given to, developing countries actually goes to the elite of that country.
The, the people who are already rich, actually can access that aid, and just take it for their own benefit.
And the majority of the people don't have any benefit for it.
So these are the, you know, different, political aspects of international aid.
And this is, uh, very evident in a country like Bangladesh.
Quite common, in, in, in many parts of the developing world.
But what is more relevant for this study, has been se_ e_ the, the emergence, of the non-governmental organisation sector.
N-G-O sector, as it's called.
Which is also a product of international aid coming in from outside.
This, uh, this sector, non-governmental organisation sector, this is called by different names, in different countries.
In Britain they're_ it's called the voluntary organising sec_ sector, or charities.
But, essentially, there're, um organisations, which are interested in alleviating poverty, and helping very, uh, poor people, or low-income communities, to regain control of their lives.
All with good intentions.
But, very often again, dependent on outside money to come in.
And with the money that comes in from outside, very often, ideas are also transferred.
So, maybe, there's a need to question the work of this section_ sector.
The third aspect of this context are_ is, uh, natural disasters.
And, if one, here's of Bangladesh, very often, it's in the news about, floods, and cyclones, and so on.
And, and, it is true that the country is, vulnerable to natural disasters, and hazards.
But, saying that, uh, there's also, uh, the need of the media to sell the news.
And so, much of, the disasters are sensationalised.
And, blown_ overblown, out of proportion really.
But anyway, there are problems, and, and there have been, recent floods.
And many of them are, because of man-made reasons, interfering with nature, and river courses, and so on.
And, because of these disasters... Uh, people have lost houses.
And that has meant, organisations have come in, and tried to provide houses.
So, many of the cases that this study, uh, researches into, are, responses by organisations, uh, after disasters.
Post-disaster housing provided to very, very low income communities, to resettle them.
Natural disasters also have various other links.
It, it is linked with the particular climate of that country.
Of Bangladesh.
The topography, it's very flat.
It is a delta.
And also, of course, the poverty.
Like i mentioned earlier that_ because people are very, very poor, they are, more vulnerable.
Because they are poor, they are forced to live in hazardous areas, to earn an income.
Because they do not have land elsewhere.
So, naturally they are much more exposed to natural disasters.
Then the third thing that the study did, was to study, or do a little survey of, um, the different types of housing in that, in that area in Bangladesh.
In rural areas of Bangladesh.
And it did a descriptive, uh, review, basically.
It just noted, and tried to describe the different hous_ types of housing, in different parts of the country.
And it was found that most of the housing, which is typically built.
Or, which is traditionally built.
It, it wa_ it reflected an adaptation to natural features, and locally available resources.
That was the basic, uh, finding of, of this study, and this survey, of existing topologies.
Now, the, the research was based on a certain way, a certain approach_ certain methods.
Uh, but it was a hybrid approach.
And just to talk a little bit about the research methods.
The hybrid approach, it borrowed from anthropological studies.
Anthropological approaches to doing research.
It borrowed from sociological studies.
Much of it was also technical.
It tried to look at, uh, construction, and techniques.
It borrowed from the hard sciences, the physical sciences.
So it was basically a hybrid approach, ah- approach to research.
And, it came out with some, basic main question.
But there was one main question, which, which, essentially, to just_ just to say what was_ is to look at how effective, projects were- were, which were built by organisations for very, very low income communities.
That was the main research question.
But, there were some questions which were derived from the main question.
And, and, um, the first one was, to see how financing techniques for building the_ well, it shou_ should be said that, um, the housing process was actually divided into three main aspects.
The first aspect was financing.
And that let to a certain sub-question.
The second aspect was about implementation.
How, these projects were implemented.
How they were, actually, carried out.
How the projects were carried out.
How they were built on the ground.
And there was a second sub-question_ implementation.
And the third sub-question, actually, dealt with how, well the houses were after they built.
How well they performed.
How happy the people were.
How much their satisfaction was, in living in these houses.
Which was_ which dealt with the housing and settlement design.
So these were the three main, uh, sub-questions, and because there was very little available information on these projects.
The orientation of the study was, uh, empirical.
And there was a lot of work done in the field.
And people, uh, researchers, with research assistants spent a lot of time, in villages, living, talking to people.
And, and, uh, finding out information.
And it was done in three different stages.
First there was a pilot, uh, survey.
Or pilot study.
Which actually went and kind of identified the areas where studies would be done.
And then, there was a main field study, which spent, more than four months liv_ in the_ in villages, in locations.
And the third one was a follow-up study.
Which happened after the 1998 floods.
Which was during the study_ was carried out.
And this brought about some changes.
So, it was decided to go and just, investigate what had happened to some of the houses which were studied in the main study, as, as a follow-up.
And to, give it, what is known as a somewhat longitudinal aspect of the study.
And, all this information was analysed, and it was analysed uh, by merging, the qualitative, and quantitative methods.
The, the bulk of the information was derived in qualitative ways.
Time was spent with people, discovering their life histories.
Um, recording their narratives, and accounts of events, and experiences.
And, and this was mainly in qualitative form.
But a lot of information was also quali_ quantitative.
Price of houses.
Time spent in building houses.
And comparative costs of hou_ building materials.
And then, so on.
And, and these were used to, uh, uh, used for some form of quantitative method.
Quantitative analytical methods using, very, very simple statistical packages.
So, that was the research approach."
"As i mentioned in the previous, uh, session, that, um, there were three main aspects to the study.
One was to study about financing.
Which, which came before building the houses.
The second was implementing the projects.
Building the houses.
And the third was finding out, how well these houses were.
How well they performed, and how happy w- people were living in them.
When financing was looked at, it was divided into two main types of financing by organisations.
But, i should also mention that some households, were not benefited from, um, agency help_ were also studied.
To give a kind of comparative, um, aspect to the, to the research.
So there were three main types of housing which were studied.
Uh- well funding that was_ which was studied.
Firstly loans, and some organisations provided loans to households, to build their houses.
That is the first type.
The second type were grants.
Outright, you know, grants.
Houses were built for people without any_ the free houses were given out.
Then the third was self-financing, when people managed to find their own money, and then, build housing for their own.
And the basic thing which was found, was that, well there was one program which was studied in great detail.
Wh_ it's called the (xx) bank.
And it is quite well known, it's been internationally acclaimed, because of this innovative way of giving loans.
And not to get into too much detail about it.
But just to say that this organisation provides, loans, at, uh, at a moderately high rate of interest to very, very poor people.
And, people use this, money to build houses for themselves.
And then they repay the loan back over, a, a period of, ten, fifteen years.
It's just like any other mortgage.
But, uh, saying that, this, this bank.
It's_ is a very specific type of bank.
It, t- tried to help people who had no access to formal banking institutions.
And so it has been very, very widely acclaimed.
And, they have won awards, and, and so on.
But, now when this study actually looked at some of the projects.
It was found that, many of these loans weren't going to very, very poor people.
Partly because they couldn't pay the money back.
And one particular case was studied where it was seen that this, uh this household took a loan.
And they were doing fine, then suddenly they were struck by probleMs  there was bad weather, and they couldn't have good agricultural yields.
And, and the started, you know, defaulting on the loan.
And once they started defaulting, they developed a very, very poor relationship with the bank.
And, and the bank had to, um, threat them, and, and want to seize their, house, or their_ the buildings which is_ that were given.
So this, this led to a very, very unhappy situation.
It has been said that the (xx) bank, for example, has a ninety-percent rate of recovery.
Now, just to say that ninety-eight percent sounds very, very high.
But what about two percent.
The (xx) bank actually built three hundred thousand houses.
So, out of three hundred thousand houses, if you take two percent, it's a very, very significant amount of money, which is not coming in, and a significant amount of people who cannot pay it back.
So, there are these probleMs  even with the grants a similar problem was seen that, you know, houses were given to people, but very often it was they were relatively better off, uh, (xx) who could manage to get grant housing.
There was never enough to give housing to everybody really.
Except for very, very few cases, and few examples.
In one project, it was seen that houses were given to everybody in the village.
But that was very unusual.
And so, that was the basic finding of financing.
That the, the very poor was_ were excluded, from such provision, or such intervention.
Secondly, there was the, the second aspect which was studied, was implementation.
And the different types of ways of building housing.
And the two main types, one was, when the agency went and build them.
Which is the agency-built form of intervention.
The second type was self-built.
And that was, not, the form of agency intervention, as in the case of financing.
Some houses were studied.
Who built housing on their own without the help of agencies, just to compare and see how effective agency intervention was, in comparison to uh self-built housing.
And, um, when agency-built housing was studied.
It was seen that there was very often corruption in the projects.
The contractors who build the housing stole money, and people got very, very poor quality of housing, and and problems like that.
Now when the self-built housing was still, it was seen that it was very advantageous, for houses, because they could control the process of building.
But, there was also, uh, it was seen that there was a decline of what is known as traditional ethics of doing things.
People were, even within self-built e- situations.
People were trying to deceive each other.
And there was this permeation of the cash economy.
People were much more interested in earning money, than they were before.
So there's this whole change in transition, within the self-built mode also.
And, uh, the assessment of implementation was essentially done, or structured according to the, the level that he household participated, in implementing house.
And even agency-built housing, if_ there were some projects, when the agency did something, some parts of the project, and then some of the other things were done the households themselves.
And, it it was seen that the more involved the household was, there was less corruption.
So there was this whole link between, household participation and corruption.
And the third aspect, which was about housing design, is, is again, to just to, just to refer to what I said before.
Is to see how well these houses or the settlements perform.
And settles were_ settlements were looked at.
There were two types of settlements_ were looked at.
Again, dividing uh, it up into agency-built, or agency-planned settlements, and and self-built, self-organised settlements.
And in the agency-planned settlements it was found that, there was a basic awareness of, design issues.
Many of these, uh, settlements were planned by professionals who weren't design professionals.
They, they were engineers.
Or even bank officials, who were just laying out_ designing buildings.
And there were the_ for example, one settlement was seen where all the toilets were kept on the outside of the par_ of the settlement.
And so there was hardly any privacy in this, uh, kind of, traditional, um, setup.
Women need much more privacy in oth_ than in other situations.
And women were not using those toilets, and they presented a very un_ unpleasant_ and, uh, unpleasant view to the outside world.
So, this is the kind of, you know, planning that was seen very often.
In the, self-organised sides, on the other hand, in contrast.
They, they were very well-designed.
They met local needs, and, and they could actually respond to the necessities of the particular household, or community.
But the main problem itself, uh, self-organised settlements, was that, they lacked infrastructure, and, n_ n_ sanitation.
Very often, they lacked tenure.
Many, many hou_ communities actually settled on land, which they could not live on very long.
And they managed to build very, very excellent settlements.
Only to be evicted after a few years.
Now, when construction and_ or building materials were looked at.
It was seen that many of these agencies were interested in promoting, and utilising more, uh, durable types of building materials.
Unlike the kind of traditional organic, less-durable type of building materials that, local communities generally use.
Many of these used, innovative, or non-con_ constru_ non-traditional building materials, or building techniques.
And some of these had become popular.
And there's one example where, uh, uh, reinforced concrete posts were used, instead of uh bamboo posts.
Bamboo posts are more typical, and common.
Uh, but they, they ah- decay and they get spoiled more quickly.
So, agencies came along, and they tried to promote this idea of building, uh, reinforced concrete posts, R-C posts, if i may use that.
And, um, and this became very, very popular.
After uh the agencies starting applying these, they were taken up by the local community, and many informal sector building material producers started_ begun producing R-C posts, and they became very popular.
But, of course, uh, R-C posts are much more expensive, than bamboo posts.
Perhaps up to five to six times more expensive.
And they were thought of unaffordable for, for_ and by very, very poor households.
So that problem remained.
Corrugated iron sheet is another example.
Very, very popular and pe_ households always wanted to aspire_ wanted, wanted to, build with C-I sheet.
They aspired for such a, such a material.
It had ah- an additional status attached to it.
If one had the C-I sheet house, it was considered better.
So... Uh, that was the_ well, but, there were other, other materials.
And they ran into major contextual probleMs  because, innovative materials... And, they were not accepted.
For example... Stabilised earth blocks, that's another idea.
That, um_ blocks made out of local mud, and using a little bit of cement to make them stronger, were, uh, were applied.
But they were_ they never caught on.
And local communities did not accept them to, to other ways of doing things.
Or, it was_ there was another example, which is the micro-concrete roofing tile.
Which were roofing tiles made out of uh cement.
And, which actually could be built locally, but even then most people don't like them.
There's one example of a project, which was built in an area with a, with a lot of coconut trees in that area.
And and coconuts used to fall on these tiles, and break them, unlike other tiles_ other types of roofing.
So local people didn't, didn't like them, and didn't want them.
In some places the agencies thought that they would build on stilts, because of floods.
But this was, again, unacceptable.
And local people didn't like these stilted houses, and some of them had actually sawed off these stilts, and lowered the houses.
Because again, because of_ for cultural reasons.
Women didn't like to climb up on those stilts.
They didn't, they didn't find them safe.
Sometimes there would be strong winds, they would find that the houses were shaking, and hazardous.
So, these was some of the probleMs then finally, the study came to a few conclusions, and_ regarding these three aspects.
And, and some of these conclusions implied certain new strategies, or approaches to doing things.
Firstly when the financing was considered, it was seen that n- there, there has to be uh some kind of, special mechanism for, the very, very poor.
Because they were being excluded.
And not that housing loans were bad, essentially.
But they could actually be, uh, mixed with grants.
So that, you know, people could get part grants, part loans.
Which is non_ in technical terms financing policy mix.
But also there was this whole potential for tapping into existing household strategies.
Households had their own networks, and own strategies for getting money.
The local village moneylenders, who could actually be supported by agencies.
So this was, this was not done by many, many (xx).
But there was, you know, hidden potential.
When implementation was u- considered, it was seen li_ as i mentioned earlier, that household participation, could actually be used to overcome, or to resist corruption.
But, saying that there are limits to cor_ uh, to participation.
Not all houses_ households want to participate, they might not have the time to participate.
Or, some households were not in a position to participate.
Such as, women-led households, who were in, in a much more vulnerable position.
And therefore, this whole idea of participation_ participation needs to be very, very seriously, thought about.
How it could actually be_ fit in, into very, very specific situations.
And how it could be integrated according to such situations, or contexts.
Then there was this whole potential for, uh, an informal, an informal link, in implementation.
For example, agencies could actually support local building materials producers, or local entrepreneurs, to produce certain building materials.
Instead of actually producing things of their own, and supplying them.
And that, that could actually prevent the problem of corruption.
But now, hou_ housing design was considered, and it was seen that th- there's a need for a comprehensive approach.
Which most_ as mentioned most agencies were not aware of.
Which, which is again, in technical terms it's known as integrated settlement planning.
But, it, it basically means, involving a very, uh, comprehensive idea of, providing infrastructure, and also building houses.
But also long-term, um, sustainability of, you know, these settlements.
So, this was lacking, and there is this need for a very comprehensive approach.
Then there's also the possibility of improving upon popular, but non-traditional alternatives.
And i mentioned the idea of R-C posts, which were provided.
But they were, they were more expensive.
And, and the research was done, later on, to find out if R-C posts could be improved.
And it was suggested that they could be built hollow, instead of the solid type that, that were built.
And a reduction of cost resulted in, in a reduction of about fifty-percent less expensive.
Of course, lighter to transport, and and easier to build with, and so on.
So such improvements can be done.
There's, there's pro_ possibly no way to way to revert to previous ways of doing things.
And, and completely.
But, the new materials that are co_ that are coming in, they could be improved upon and adapted.
And especially those materials which ha_ which have proved to be popular.
Such as concrete posts, or corrugated iron sheet.
But, what is very, very important, and which has, which has been given very little attention, is the whole idea of re- regenerating, and improving the natural resource base.
Much of this bamboo, uh, cultivation needs to be improved.
They can be i- i- ideas such as a bamboo farm which just produces bamboo, as_ for building materials.
And ways of improving bamboo production.
Improve techniques of propagation, for example, of bamboo.
Maybe chemical treatment of bamboo, to season them better.
And so, there, there's this whole area which is, which hasn't been dealt with at all.
Which agencies can direct their efforts towards, and readdress that.
And finally, there's some general_ there were some general conclusions of this study.
Is that, okay_ there are new ideas, new technologies, and these have been experimented, and worked with, in many other parts of the world.
But, they haven't_ the main obstacle which is_ which remains is disseminating these ideas.
How to to communicate these ideas.
How to, how to make people understand it is_ that there are ideas which are outside of_ which can be actually_ be adapted.
And how to disseminate these.
So, this is one of the main issues that_ okay, the technology is there.
There's perhaps no reason to, innovate new ways of doing things.
But the idea's the_ is to ho_ just to give people the benefit, of knowledge which is already there.
And, let people take it onboard, and adapt it to their own circumstances.
Modify and change as necessary.
And, uh, the final thing, which is very, very important, and which has started coming up, is the_ the idea of partnership or networking.
Which is related to the previous idea of dissemination.
There can be no dissemination unless there is partnership between different parts o_ of the world.
For example, there could be partnerships m- which are international in nature.
Natio_ or national in nature, or even local, between different groups, who are doing different things, who can share, ideas among themselves.
And build up different forms of solidarity crews, which can actually help low-income communities, overcome their predicament."
"Well the collapse of the Soviet Union was not inevitable.
Um, I don't think, um, um, anybody could say that, um, the Soviet Union was bound to collapse, um, in the late eighties.
Um, and certainly we look at_ we look at it now, and, it all seems, uh, very ordered in_ and, uh, just destined to happen.
Uh, but... I think that the, the Soviet Union of course, uh, could have, could have, could be around right now.
Um, if it hadn't been, for, for many of the policies and_ that were pursued by, by, by the Soviet Union's last, um, leader, Mikael Gorbachev.
Um, but if the- if I have to point to some long term trend, um, um, that influenced the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Um taking, taking as, as,_ as given that, you know, there was this person, uh, named Gorbachev, and that he, um, put in place a number of policies.
Um, basically... The Soviet Union, um, collapsed because, um, it couldn't_ i,it couldn't meet, uh, all the obligations that_ the oblig- the obligations that it had acquired.
I mean, um, th- the burden of Empire for the Soviet Union was, was just, um, becoming too much, by the, by the late eighties.
And, um, certainly it could have muddled through, you know, who knows, ten, fifteen, twenty years.
Uh, but by, by the, by the late seventies, um, it was clear that, uh, the Soviet union was engaged in a, in a sort of race or competition with the West, with the United States.
And it couldn't keep up, um, and there is, um, a long-term trend observed, um, in the, in the  Soviet economy.
The So- Soviet economy grows very quickly, very fast, um... In the forties and the fifties.
In the sixties it begins to slow down and the slo- the slow down becomes more and more pronounced in the, in the seventies, and, and finally in the_ in the eighties, the Soviet economy is not growing.
And this is crucial because, uh, um, the Soviet Union was, um, a military, industrial complex.
Um, um, imposed on, on a police state.
That means, um, the Soviet Union needed, um, its military... Industrial complex to produce the technologies and the weapons, that, that, uh, could allow it to continue competing with, the United States and with the, West.
Which is, um, what its position of super power, uh, obliged it to do.
Um, but... Because of the nature of its closed economy, um, the military industrial complex, was observing more and more resources, uh, from, from a shrinking pie as time went by.
And i- it was producing less and less.
And, um, for the_ for the West, um, that was not a problem because the, the nature of western economies is different.
And, um, you know, resources that are going to the military don't necessarily have to come from... The civilian economy.
But for the Soviet Union that was a big problem.
And the Soviet Union, um, was never, uh, really a super power to begin with.
Uh, uh, i- it_ as, as a country, um, i- it was the mo- the most multiethnic f- you know, federation in the world.
There were many, nationalities, many_ there were many simmering problems, many simmering tensions that, that had been there for a long time.
And, uh, uh, when somebody actually came up and, and admitted to the fact that, the way of things, had_ that had been_ the way things had been done for a long time had to change.
It was too much stress for the whole, uh, system to bear, so it, it cracked and, you know, it, it basically, uh, ended up, uh, breaking, you know, in the end."
"So, now we come to the question of American capitalism, in and of itself.
Now that, uh, the listener may have become privy, um, to some of the complaints, that have been leveled against American state capitalism.
Now comes the question, ""what can be done about it."" the, propagandists in the United States would have us believe that, American state capitalism is the only, uh, system they can obviously allow for, for growth.
For, infinite growth of capacity in terms of participation of the individual, and wealth and acquiring wealth.
Or, shall we say, the only economy that is pa_ that is_ can be constructed for for maximal prosperity.
And it would lead one to believe that any other economic system_ or any other, um, anything that diverges considerably from the, political concepts and economic concepts of American state capitalism is inherently doomed to fail.
We have actually seen examples, of alternative forms of capitalism.
And we can see that some of the most successive_ successful nations in the world, including those two nations Germany and Japan.
Who are right now the leaders, um, in the exports of manufactured goods.
Both countries of course which, actually have incredibly high standards of living.
Both the Germans and the Japanese.
The Japanese having a hierarchical system, that involves lifetime employment, um, an export driven economy, and very tight controls on the flow, of capital and credit.
The Germans having a_ yet another export driven economy that maintains high wages, high benefits.
And a very stable form of social welfare.
The Japanese and the Germans in the minds of Americans, or those, uh, conservative Americans who believe that they have everything figured out.
What essentially_ um, be two examples of economies that should, honestly fail.
The Germans and the Japanese by right, um, or by right in the eyes of the American, uh, right wing, uh, economist.
Should not be having the high capacities, um, for wealth and well-being that they have.
What Americans should honestly ask, is what are, the Germans and the Japanese_ the Scandinavians, I also like to throw into the pool as well, who have a very highly social democratic society and export driven economy.
Um, great, um, equality in terms of distribution of income and opportunity, as well.
What are they doing that we aren't.
Why do they have, um, rates of growth that actually exceed ours in terms of, um, rates of growth and productivity, and expansion of the substantive economy.
Now let me define my terMs  there are first two economies that the listener should be aware of.
First there is the financial economy.
And second of all the productive economy.
When the Americans speak about the expansion of their economy.
They like to lump these two together.
Right now as, one may be aware, here in the late nineteen-nineties, um, the American_ the Americans have, as one their growing in_ exports financial instruments.
The United States’ financial economy is booming.
And for all intents and purposes the Department of Labor would have us believe, or the Department of Commerce in the United States, would have us believe that the economy is growing at an exponential rate.
Essentially riding on the back of an overvalued stock market.
On the other hand, the Europeans and the Japanese and the Koreans.
And others that are participating in massive growth, both in Western Europe and the Pacific rim of Asia.
Like to look at their, um, expanding economies in terms of the growth of their productive economies.
And what I mean by productive economies, are essentially those parts of, gross domestic product or those parts of the political economy that go into manufacturing goods and services.
Not just financial services.
If one actually looked at the United States of America we have the most anemic, growth of productivity in the world.
While_ whereas the Japanese, um, even in the recession still have higher rates of productivity growth than the United States.
And the same goes for Germany.
That despite the fact that it has, uh, purportedly, um, ten per cent underemployment.
And i, uh, I am very cautious of using the world unemployment, but underemployment still have higher rates of economic growth and_ than the United States.
And - in comparable positions of unemployment and higher rates of productivity growth.
All in the time, wherein maintaining, um, lower rates per capita of homelessness, of violent crime, of crime in general.
There is crime against property and petty larceny etc.
Um, used as examples.
Um, and still maintaining a society wherein there is equivalent or rough equivalent o- of outcome_ um, equality of opportunity and fairly reasonable, um, distributions of income.
How is this possible.
How can they have, w- gro- growth rates which are higher than the American system.
Although the American system claims to have maximal liberties.
Allows for corporations and limited partnerships, and other business organizations to have constitutional rights.
Um, we have tort reform.
We have, the maximal liberalization of credit and capital in the United States.
Why is it that despite all of these, and despite having to tolerate gross inequalities of income distribution, um, within our political economy.
Why is it that we still can't keep up with those nations that are considered on the surface more socially democratic.
Why, why is that.
And, very simply one must look at the American economy and say that there are portions of the population that are not participating in the economy.
We are not at maximal capacity.
Why is that.
Because twenty-five percent of Americans are underemployed.
That means they are a dead weight loss to the economy.
They are not, generating, sufficient products, and services for export to generate the, income and the credit, the capital that we need to be_ that, uh, needs to be brought back into the country.
And at the same time they don't have sufficient disposable income to buy back the services and the goods that they produce.
And that’s considered by most economists to be a great loss.
On the other hand, the Europeans and the East Asians believe that it is, essential that they have, a maximized disposable income of their citizen, citizens.
Such that they are full participants in the economy, and they can buy back the goods and services they produce.
That way, we can actually see that the attempt to, maximize capital in the short term, that's used in the United States is grossly, inefficient.
Whereas it has been touted by the press as being very efficient.
Whereas those, blasphemies, or those heresies against American state capitalism that are taking, um, are, are playing themselves out in Scandinavia and in Germany and in Japan_ I just use those as examples.
Um, there are others.
Um, at the same time have led to, economic growth... Contrary to all that, that would would be believed were one to listen to, to Gary Becker and Paul Krugman and, uh, other, um, experts here in the United States of America.
So what can be done.
But, first of all what needs to be done, is to actually eliminate the dead weight loss on the economy.
First of all by, eliminating the gross expenditure that Americans have for health care.
We spend more, of, of our gross domestic product on health care than any other industrialized nation on earth.
And that is a huge deadweight loss to the economy.
Not just merely on behalf of those that are uninsured.
And those are usually those that are underemployed.
But even those Americans that have, um, a world class disposal income.
That is middle-middle-class Americans, upper-middle-class Americans etc.
Um, who often spend, a larger per cent of t- of their discretionary income, on health care than their counterparts, uh, in Western Europe, and in Asia in fact.
Um, but I would particularly like to focus upon Western Europe in the contradictions that therein lie.
Um, what's more is that the United States, um, must fundamentally, um, change its ideas with regard to, the way we construct our corporations.
And there are two models.
The models that are used by the Scandinavians, and the Germans and the Japanese involve what is called the carrot model.
Tell the worker_ tell the laborer that he is part of a team.
Realize that the hierarchy may exist as a means of, of incentive, of generating incentive among the workers.
In that sense we can have, distributions, um, of income that are more equal.
But at the same time having gradations that maintain incentive.
And this was one of the common arguments of the American state capitalists.
That more equitable distributions of income eliminate incentive to work hard.
And that is just not the case of anyone who has had any experience with Japanese or German workers, realize that they work very hard.
And may be, uh, even more so that your standard American.
So this argument doesn't hold water.
Um, what's more is that a lot of_ is particularly in Scandinavia, and particularly G-Germany.
There is a lot of democratic participation in the maintenance of high wages.
The maintenance of pensions.
And even in the distribu- distribution of natural resources and capital within the country.
The fact that more discretion is put in the hands of your everyday worker.
Regardless of his social status.
In determining the direction in which the economy moves, has actually led to what is, essentially equality.
But at the same time growth.
It seems as though the market is not the only source of rationality, for determining the direction of economic growth.
Um, let us say that, were the United States to be able_ we- were the United States to allow its citizens, um, a decision as to what subsidies are given to which corporations.
Which industries the Americans should develop, we would most likely have a much more rational source, of economic decision making.
Rather than letting the, the individual market interpretations of individual corporations or bodies of stockholders, determine in what direction the American economy moves.
This has proven to be, effective, um, particularly for, um, particularly for the Western Europeans.
E- especially the Germans and the Scandinavians who have allowed, um, their governments, or have always elected governments that have protected their wages and protected their interests and also protected, um,access or public determination of the direction of the growth of the economy.
Um, the difference, um, in lying in East Asia may be that for the most part decisions, um, in the movement in the economy may be made from the top.
But there are always for the, for the maintenance of, of the status quo.
Maintenance of an export driven economy and tight regulations of capital.
Such that we want to actually have an economy that most works for full employment.
So you have one of two ways in which to maintain the best interests of the vast majority of people.
Democratic control, which is evidence in Western Europe, or in East Asia.
Particularly I would like to focus on South Korea and Japan.
Where there are instances where the government participates.
As there are large governmental organizations that participates in corporate decision making.
And the idea to the benefit of the, of the majority is to, constantly make rational market decisions, that maximize the income and therefore_ and minimizes, uh, unemployment among the general populace.
This is not a concern in the United States because we have attempted to, disconnect inflation and unemployment_ attempted to disconnect the Phillips' curve.
Which says that inflation, um, varies inversely with unemployment.
We have attempted to destroy that.
It is not our interest to, um, m- maximize employment.
Our interest is to minimize inflation.
And until we have, an organization_ and since we are Americans and since we, uh, we honestly do believe in democratic institutions or at least, we believe that the majority of Americans believe in democratic institutions.
We would want some democratic method of, of determining subsidies to corporations.
Determining which, uh, asso_ which companies and which associations of stockholders and limited partnerships are, given taxpayer money, um, for the growth of the economy.
And then some rationality from the American population, as to what direction they will find themselves_ in what direction we should push wages and in which direction we should push pensions, in which directions, uh, we should push, uh, unemployment.
Are we going to sacrifice small percentage points of inflation in favor of fuller employment in the United States.
And can these decisions, increasingly be made by the American people, rather than unaccountable corporations.
Um, the threat therefore must first to be_ to reinstate... Democracy into the United States.
We have to put democratic controls back in the hands of the people.
We have to realize that corporations and limited partnerships do not have constitutional rights.
Only individuals.
Only human beings.
In the American sy- system should have constitutional rights.
And therefore, if the constitutional right to, prosperity_ and we, we have, we have an idea that part of the liberties of the United States involves, motions towards prosperity.
Then those very individuals, who are to prosper, should be the ones making the decisions as to how one achieves a level of prosperity.
Therefore, um, using, using East Asia and using Western Europe as examples of how, one can have a full employment economy, with...Equitable income distribution levels.
And at the same time high growth.
And in th- and I guess in the Western case that the United States is an offshoot of European culture.
Democratic institutions to allow Americans to, rationalize irrational market forces.
This could be a way we could solve the crises, of American state capitalism."
"Many philosophers believe that the most interesting subject, within metaphysics is_ are arguments for the existence of God.
Probably the most famous argument is referred to as the ontological argument.
That is the argument from unfacilitated reason.
That is without, any clues from the environment.
Not wi- without any, uh, mathematical axioms how do we prove that God could possibly exist.
The first and probably the most important ontological argument, was actually started by an Italian monk, sent by the Pope to become Archbishop of Canterbury, in I believe the sixth century, Anselm, was so famous in fact for his arguments, that even though his original, um, arguments for the existence of God were merely oral.
His students forced him to actually write them down in two volumes, the Mono- Monologion and Proslogion.
The two texts argue from basic principles, or as he calls them a posteriori reason.
The idea is merely this.
Let us use the example of a painter.
The painter has an idea of a painting.
He believes that, the painting should be one of a landscape or may be let us suppose it is a still life.
In his mind, there is, a beautiful painting.
One that is fully planned out.
May be he has ideas of every color, and every structure within the painting.
Then he sets about the work of actually painting it.
He goes and he uses them_ the actual picture that he has generated in his own mind.
The painting itself_ is the painting itself is great as the original concept that he has in his mind.
Was it necessary, that the painting should come into existence merely because it existed in his mind.
Or did the painting have existence merely by having been cogitated to begin with.
Is it necessary, for all things, that are considered existent to have physical reality, before they have men- or subsequent to their having mental reality.
Anselm's argument is famous because of its logical simplicity.
Its simplicity is this.
God exists merely as this.
God is that which can_ uh, the greater_ God exists as a thing, of which no greater thing can be conceived.
It sounds simple, but is a little more complicated than that.
We can think of all things as being inherently good.
Some things are inherently better than others, because they achieve certain qualities we seem as_ we deem as good for ourselves.
They are good, for one aspect or another.
One is good because it is pleasant to the senses, another is good because it enables us in our lives.
What makes God good.
And what makes things absolutely good.
Anselm suggests that that which is absolutely good, incorporates all goods.
Goods that are inherently pleasurable, goods that are rational for life, that is it lends itself to our leavng a peaceable existence and leaving_ living an existence of contentment.
And also has a certain level of shall we say inherent mental satisfaction.
We see it, and we know that it is pleasant.
We know that there is nothing that it is lacking in goodness.
It has achieved all good things.
Is there anything within our physical world that could possibly achieve all of these good things.
Or are good things within our physical world inherently_ actually inherently need that which incorporates all goodness.
Anselm believes that that is necessary.
That there are things, or a thing that exists in which, it accumulates all goods, all potential goods.
If one... Finds that something is good, let's say beautiful.
It is pretty and that is the manner in which it is good.
It is not necessarily good because it gives a peaceable existence.
That which gives us a peaceable existence, let us assume, that it is a piece of meat.
It is good because it feeds us, it is not necessarily good because it is beautiful.
Few people would argue that a piece of meat is beautiful.
But there are things.
And there should be one thing according to Anselm that is a reservoir of all goodness.
Such that there is no good that it is lacking.
Anselm told his students, that there can exist only one thing.
And that one thing that incorporates all good things is God.
It is also by necessity that if other things are to achieve their goodness, they must be good as according to,or with response to that which is absolutely good.
Hence all good things all beautiful things, all necessary things, are inherently good because they are originated or at least held  as a stan_ held against a standard which is absolutely good.
How else would we know that it was good.
Anselm there believed_ therefore believed that God was essentially the reservoir of all goodness and that in a_ in a_ in, in fact that there are things that exist within our physical world that are, in, in themselves good then God must exist.
This argument held for centuries.
And Descartes argument a posteriori argument for the existence of God takes on a similar fleshy tone.
The ontological argument for all intents and purposes, has been give the subjection, or has been subjected to monologic, by such great philosophers as A J Ayre and Charles Hartshorne.
Movement now, has moved_ movement within philosophy has moved away from ontological argument,to other arguments.
Ontological argument is obviously very facile for pre-scientific societies.
New post scientific societies, or entirely developed societies have moved to arguments for God that become inherently more and more cosmological.
What is a cosmological argument for the existence of God.
One can say that there are two.
One is weak and one is strong.
The weak cosmological argument is simply this.
We must have been created, else we would not be here to actually cogitate existence of that wh- which created us.
This anthropological argument or anthropocentric argument.
That is man centered argument or human centered argument is actually considered weak for a reason as the listener might believe.
The strong cosmological argument on the other hand, believes that all things exist in the form of cause and effect.
If we think of evolution, we know that evolution exists on multiple scales.
One can look at not only biological evolution, but chemical evolution.
For example, all chemicals that exist originated from hydrogen.
Hydrogen, was the first chemical to exist within the universe.
That has been shown.
All other chemicals are derivatives of hydrogen.
Hydrogen is a simple molecule.
It exists of a single proton and a single electron.
Helium the next most common molecule consists of two two protons and two electrons.
Originally elementary particle physicists believed that hydrogen, or helium merely originated from a collision between two hydrogen molecules.
And the next elements were derived from subsequent collisions from simple molecules.
These evolutionary ideas, established the idea within the philosophical community as well, that all things were necessarily evolutionary.
And everything is necessarily causal.
As we have moved further and further, into physical theory the idea has become, evident that things must have reached an original cause.
That popularized as the idea of the big bang, the cause of the universe has ultimately been the idea of an ultimate condensation of matter.
How is this matter conden- as_ condensed.
Why was a form of highly condensed matter necessarily expand to less condensed forms of matter.
What's more, it seems as though all of these things obey a given law of physics.
Why are there multiple laws of physics.
Why are the physical laws the same everywhere in the universe.
Why is it possible that they could not be different everywhere in the universe.
This seeming bed of such, of such positive_ positivist thinking was popularized within Germany.
And actually found its origins in the metaphysics of Kant and further developed by Wittgenstein in the Vienna Circle.
The idea has now become quite trite within the philosophical community of cause and effect.
The cosmological argument therefore is that God exists, has essentially the rationale element in the development of the universe.
Otherwise, it is perfectly contra- perfectly reasonable that the universe could possibly be made up of a motley assortment of different laws.
Of different structures of matter.
Of even different intelligence.
All of these, mainly, the ontological and cosmological arguments therefore, have developed with technology and developed with society.
And lend themselves to different ideas of the existence of God.
The different potency, and their different strengths, in their influence of the belief of the listener, I believe is an exercise to the student.       "
"As an example of, what I think is a very important original source.
I'd like to talk about the Venerable, Bede.
First of all, for people who don't happen to know, who was he.
He was an English, or to be more accurate an Anglian Monk, who lived and died at the Monastery of Jarrow near, to what is now Newcastle in Ireland.
No, I don't think it's in Ireland, on the coast.
Um, and he died in seven thirty-five.
Um, and he wrote an ecclesiastical history of the English nation, in medieval Latin.
Um, y- you wrote in Latin, rather than Anglo-Saxon, or whatever your Germanic dialect was then.
Um, it's rather important, for several reasons.
It's a first time a general, sort of, history or survey of what was to become, England, you know, in the next couple of centuries.
Was written by anyone, who could broadly be called, the, English, or proto-English.
Even though, of course, he was writing in simplified Latin.
Um, there had been a few things written about Britain beforehand.
But, by_ partly by outsiders, like Tacitus in Britain and Germany, a few hundred years before.
But he would be approaching it, rather like an English gentleman, writing about India, or Afghanistan, in the, um, nineteenth century.
You know, he was a sophisticated, um, outsider belonging to the conquering nation.
Then, other chronicles at the time were written by Welsh and Irish people.
Who were, equally natives.
I don't think any of them was, um, a rival to Bede, in the sense that they were attempting to, do the history of the whole of Britain.
Not at that point.
They did later.
And also, of course, by definition, they weren't the start of, the English.
When they wrote about the English, in fact, the Welsh regarded them as, very much, the enemy.
So with Bede.
You focus, it's the first direct evidence, by a proto-English person, of the tribes, and peoples who were to become England.
Who were to form the Kingdom of England, by nine hundred A-D.
Secondly, he's probably the first original source I ever encountered.
In our first term as undergraduates, we had to study the Venerable Bede.
Um, for two reasons.
One, to check on our knowledge of medieval Latin.
In those days, people who studied History were expected to equipped.
Secondly, because, quite rightly, the dons thought it was a very useful source, to introduce us to the Anglo-Saxon period.
It would be useful when we started to study, Anglo-Saxon history.
Now, Bede is describing, um, largely, the, um, conversions of England from paganism.
Which happened, um, about a hundred years, roughly before he was writing.
Which happened between the five nineties, and the six fifties.
Um, in other words, I think, his narrative trails off, about the time when he himself was born.
Which was probably about, six sixty.
He dies in seven thirty-five.
And, um, his characterisation of various people, like Kings_ Kings Oswald and Oswy of Northumberland, for example.
Or the Scottish-Irish monk in Aiden, who comes down to Northumberland, are very vivid.
Um, and, he tells one a lot, about, um, conditions of those days.
But, of course, there are, um, strong limitations.
Which, um, tantalise present day historians, who'd like to know more.
Um, Bede will mention things, casually, say about economic or social life.
Cattle herding, or something.
And because they're so familiar with_ to him, so much of everyday, he just mentions them in half a sentence, and goes on to more interesting things.
Which is religion and high politics.
So, just as we don't spend a lot of time saying, um, elaborating the fact that some character crossed a road, using,  zebra-crossing, or something.
We don't go on and on about that.
Um, and, but also he has obsessions, which are, little to do with us.
About how, someone_ some saintly person died, then forty years later, their tomb was opened, and a very sweet smell came from it.
Or he congratulates someone for hanging on to the jewel of their virginity.
Which always used to amuse us, as you can expect, when you're eighteen.
It's not something we wanted to do.
But Bede thought it was a marvellous thing.
Um, you know, so there's a lot of that.
Um, he's also, um, although he appreciates, and is very sympathetic towards the Celtic Tradition of Christianity.
He talks about the Roman Tradition, rather more.
Um, it's_ to set the scene, there were two waves of chr_ um, uh, missionaries.
One sent by the Popes, from Rome.
Symbolised by St.
Augustine of Canterbury, who arrives at the court of the King of Kent, Ethelred in_ not Ethelred, sorry, I've forgotten the name of this King of Kent.
But in five nine six.
The other which came into Northumbria, of which Bede was a native, were the Irish, who'd been Christianised_ this is all very complicated_ Christianised by the Welsh, or Romana British.
Then they decided to bring it back into Scotland.
And then they decided they had a duty to evangelise the Northern English.
But the Irish, or Celtic Church, it wasn't actually a separate church from Rome.
They acknowledged the authority of the Pope.
But they had different custoMs  and in six six four, their customs had been overruled by the mainstream Roman Church.
So, Bede was brought up in the Roman Church, and regards the Irish as spontaneous, but not properly organised, very good people.
So, he emphasises the Roman Tradition rather more, particularly as time goes on.
Um, for instance, when he's talking about the evangelisation of Sussex, um, he emphasises, very much, a Roman mission.
He describes in detail, which down to Sussex.
He does not talk_ but he also mentions about a sentence, that when they got there, they encountered an Irish Monastery already there.
And he just mentions that, as an aside.
So that tells us one thing.
That Irish, sort of, um, fairly spontaneous missionary activities going on all over Britain, not just in the North.
One things.
And secondly, um, it's tantalising because we would like Bede to say more about it.
To give the same at_ attention to these Irish Missions in Southern England, that he gives to the Roman Mission.
But he doesn't, he just mentions it.
And then continues to focus on the Roman Missionaries.
So, um, it, uh, is_ that I think, is_ shows, certains or limitations.
But, we were taught, another valuable thing.
We had some very good lecturers.
And, we were taught to use_ not to take, you know, material at face value.
Not just to accept the agenda, that the writer, in this case Bede, was putting out.
Because, he's a highly intelligent man, he organised his material well.
But he's a man of_ let's see how long ago.
Um, twelve hundred and_ between twelve hundred, and thirteen hundred years ago.
You can't think like that.
But to unpluck_ to try and use what he says, to glean as, as much as possible from it.
Like a detective.
To use his clues, and push them further.
And to put what Bede says, together with other evidence.
Converted written evidence, or contradictory of an evidence.
Also, with archaeological evidence.
Um, it's always, rather troublesome of course, if you have only one piece of evidence, of any particular period, or any particular topic.
And it's very illuminating if you can also find, a totally different piece of evidence.
Now for this period we're talking about, which the Victorians used to call the Dark Ages.
A valued judgement in itself.
We don't have too much written evidence.
Bede, is of course, one of the shining exceptions.
But, there is an awful lot of archaeological evidence.
In fact, we know far more about, um, early Anglo-Saxon England, through archaeology, than the Victorians did.
Because in Victorian times it had just started up.
They had their Bede, and they could read Latin, better than, in general the educated class, better than the educated class now.
But they didn't have so much scientific archaeology.
So, one way of using evidence, is to put Bede together with, archaeological evidence, digging up the halls of the Kings of Northumberland, for example.
So, um, that is an early introduction I think to, what is a very good historical source.
But, an awful lot of skill still has to be taken in interpreting an historical source.
Secondly, tantalisingly, historical sources stop dead, when you want them to go further, because the writer's agenda is not yours.
How could it be."
"One of the most interesting literary theorists, I believe in the English language right now, is the Yale professor Harold Bloom.
Who has found his preoccupation, with the ideas of influence.
The ideas that, major writers within the western canon have primarily been, i-influenced in their, their generations of character, their ideas of narrative, their ideas of form.
By being influenced by those writers that have preceded th- hav- have preceded them.
The most important in Bloom's mind being, uh, William Shakespeare.
Essentially considered the, the greatest writer, not only in the English language, but the greatest writer in the world period.
Um, he looks at major writers in English, and even, um, in Spanish and French, uh, to a large extent, who have been influenced by Shakespeare's ideas of personification.
How he develops his characters.
Um, how his characters are, are influenced, through struggles with, their own personal experiences.
With their ideas of, of, of paternal domination and, and maternal, uh, feminization and other such very, uh, bizarre psychoanalytical, uh, influences.
Particularly he's interested in the very scenes with in Shakespeare that typify, um, very complex character development.
Particularly, he supplies most of his sources in Hamlet, considered Shakespeare's greatest play.
In Hamlet one can see not only... All of the, all of, um, Bloom's major, uh, preoccupation's were such things as paternal, paternal domination.
In the ghost scene, the very beginning of Hamlet.
When, when Shakespeare and, and Hamlet himself is, um, brought into contact with the ghost of his murdered father.
Read at a, at a very, primary level this seems to be just the spark that is needed to light Hamlet uh, onto to his, his wavering pursuit of, revenge for his father.
He is caught in a struggle with himself.
He is caught in, in, in-between action and inaction.
And the question that Bloom asks is not the, the agon, in which Hamlet is engaged between, um, his tendency to want to, let things pass.
Let, let, uh, his father's murderer reign.
And, uh, ravage his mother, I guess.
And, um, actually seek revenge of his father.
This battle between action and na- inaction isn't of interest to Bloom.
What he is much interested in is how, paternal domination.
The idea that it's possible that the reason for the inaction is not because, Hamlet appreciates the status quo, but instead fears his father.
He doesn't necessarily want to avenge his father because of, past experiences.
Such things, such close readings of the text.
Such ideas of influence, not only with i_ with Shakespeare influencing other writers.
But within Shakespeare himself.
Draws, um, into_ draws power into Blooms ideas_ that he expounds in his book, the ""Anxiety of Influence.""  as well as, a lot of the tracks that he uses, um, the western canon.
Particularly intr- of particular interest to me is, his interpretation of Shakespeare's influence of James Joyce.
Which I find incredibly powerful.
Um, is_ one who is incredibly interested in Joyce may or may not have known, um, Joyce, um, when he left Ireland, uh, for continental Europe.
Not only uttered the famous quote that he would go and write the poetry of his race, that is the Irish race.
But that Joyce found a preoccupation in achieving status, within the English language, with Shakespeare.
He intended to write novels that would, essentially make him, the, the twentieth century, uh, foil to Shakespeare so to speak.
</P<>this is an account of Irish history permeated into the ideas of one mans dreams on one given night.
Just as Ulysses was the, uh, was the journey of one man through the streets of Dublin.
Only two men, through the streets of Dublin, um, on one given day.
Um, Earwi_ Earwicker's Dreams instead of inciting him to action, or inciting him to a struggle.
An active struggle between action and inaction, uh, receives pacifying.
They're just passive ones through history.
He is neither a contributor to some great development of narrative.
Some great historical plot as one we have seen in Julius Caesar for example.
Or, even, even to some great resolution of a struggle as we have in Lear.
What he hasn't said is a constant, constant passive acceptance of struggles.
Um, for example at the very beginning of Finnegan's Wake we have Earwicker within the museum.
Um, a museum that is given no name.
But a museum in which a, a consumptive tour guide attempts to give him a history of the English subjugation of the Irish.
And the, the narrative is given in this, in this consumptive, broken, uh, Irish, Irish-English.
Broken dialect, that seems to essentially_ it enters Earwicker's mind, there is no judgment made.
It is history, and it is left alone.
It is not something that would incite a Hamlet to go and seek revenge for his father.
Instead what it is just passive acceptance.
</P<>yes, the English have done thus and such in Ireland.
This is how I would communicate this in the language of dreaMs  This is how Joyce would do this.
Um, this is not Shakespeare, this is Joyce.
And this is how Joyce attempts his struggles, um, to the top_ to the very pinnacles of English in his attempt to be the foil to Shakespeare.
Like can be said, um, in a very interesting scene at the, uh, one of the lighter chapters of Ulysses.
When Bloom_ Harold hehe, Harold Bloom himself but Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus enter a bar, where Molly Bloom, Leopold's wife is there being ravaged by the bar owner.
And in the, uh, the scene_ it may or may not be famous to the listener.
The portrait of Shakespeare is hanging in the bar.
And Dedalus, even Dedalus be- begins to address the portrait of Shakespeare.
And the portrait of Shakespeare talks back to him.
In the scene it is, uh, reflected that_ and this maybe_ this may or may not be somebody to the writer.
The same sort of, um, mad conjecture as to paternity that Hamlet has in, in the original play by Shakespeare.
Here Shakespeare's portrait attempts to convince, um, Dedalus, that Hamlet is really his own father.
Or that, in, in essence all men attempt to be their own foster, to be their own engenderer, their own progenitor, so to speak.
And this sort of confusion.
This sort of mad confusion that Hamlet uses as a ruse in the play, but the original play by Shakespeare is actually a_ of legitimate philosophical concern to Dedalus, as was reflected in the very beginning scene of Ulysses when his is with Buck Mulligan in Montelo tower now he is in the later, uh, stages of the, uh, day in the bar with Polly (Molly) Bloom.
This, this great idea, um, has led to great confusion.
How Joyce, instead of using this as, um, a ruse.
As Shakespeare has used it.
Has actually used it as an influence on Dedalus.
There is not action that is borne about by it, unlike, in Hamlet.
But the struggle is now, um, commuted to one of, of passivity.
</P<>we're wondering through the streets of Dublin.
We have entered a bar.
We're seeing my friend's wife ravaged by the bar owner.
And we will drink some Guinness, and possibly go home.
Uh,and be happy.
We will not, uh, venture into, um, uh, have the (xxx) who will not have the great friends of Denmark come and watch the great slaughter within the, uh, the palaces of England_ of, of Denmark.
Uh, um, we will instead just have our beer.
We will go home and pretend that history has not happened, we will ignore it's existence.
This is how Joyce combats Shakespeare.
And these sort of struggles are of great interest to Bloom.
He reflects these in a number of writers, not merely Joyce.
Most poignantly at Joyce, but he talks it in_ with regard to Beckett and the Latin American writers including Neruda and Jorge Luis Borges um, with Gerta, with Milton.
And in a summary of others that have been influenced.
Or via, via their press agent um, the words of Shakespeare or the struggles of Shakespeare, um, within his writing process have influenced Western literature.
Harold Bloom's ideas are quite controversial.
They've they require a very in depth reading of the authors that sites.
And a very thorough knowledge of Shakespeare, which he obviously has.
Um, his literary theories have been massively influential.
Although they, um, they have been quite controversial.
Bloom himself has said in the New York Times, that his theories have gone through the three stages of any great literary theory.
First was dismissal, this is ridiculous.
Who, who could possibly believe that even authors that had preceded Shakespeare, Dante.
Could possibly be influenced by, by Shakespeare.
But, but somehow through through such presaging of Shakespeare's, uh, motifs.
Dante and Shakespeare have this sort of transgenerational communication one with the other.
</P<>the second stage in, in Bloom's theory.
Uh, or the development of Bloom's theory has gone through the stage of, um, yes this makes sense.
But it has already been discovered by other literary theorists.
Bloom has discovered nothing new.
And um, all-in-all, um, this is a theory that any number of great commentators (Avoire Levis), uh, uh, Samuel Johnson have hehe already picked up whether this is true or not.
And then, lastly, it has come to the stage to the stage where it is trite.
It is just considered normal protocol.
Yes, Bloom's theory is right on the button.
But we knew it all along.
And, no he is original but, who cares, we now want to move onto, uh, new concepts of the development of Western literature.
And such theories are widely influential, um, in how Bloom's probably the most of all.    "
"Cancer has largely, hm, been a scourge, on the planet.
It is, considered one of the largest killers, of any disease_ of any non-accidental cause of death.
Cancer's, main strength, comes from the fact that all cancer is is a natural mutation of the body's process of growth.
All cells, want to divide.
And cells that normally divide reach a certain limit at which they no longer_ actually no longer grow.
This growth has to be regulated, internally by protei-_ by interactions between proteins and D-N-A.
In the process of growth, there are means by which the cell, regulates, its ability, uh, to expand its own progeny.
Thus the cell says, ""thus far shall you go.""  in a cancerous cell, the internal mechanisms_ the internal interactions between proteins and D-N-A, are mutated.
The ability, for the internal growth mechanisms to tell the cell to stop growing, have been broken.
Either through natural mutations, that is inherent genetic mutations that, the subject has had since birth.
Through toxins that are present in the environment.
Such as chemical toxins, dioxin or, um, even through exposure to such things as excess amounts of x-rays, which are possible from such varied sources as too much exposure to the sun.
Or even such outlandish sources as possibly sitting a little too close to the television set.
Outlandish as this may seem, cancer is a very real problem.
And the means by which, uh, we can stop cancer are actually quite varied.
There are numerous genes that have been determined to cause cancer.
All of which are related to the ma- machinery within the cell, that tells the cell to stop growing.
For example, the cell, when it bumps up against another cell, and finds that even if it decides to divide, it can't, it can't find any further space within the organism will tell itself_ will have, um, its internal machinery say ""stop.
We will not grow any more.""  a cancerous cell on the other hand will continue to grow.
And will actually start to destroy other cells.
Kill healthy cells, and grow over top of them, hence a tumor.
A tumor is merely an outgrowth of a cell that fails to stop dividing, when the body has told it to stop dividing.
It in the process has killed other healthy cells that are not cancerous.
And it has attempted to commandeer as much o- of the body's resources as is possible.
Cancer is deadly.
Not only because of the expansion of the tumor and its disruption_ its physical disruption.
The preponderance of size.
But also from the fact that as the patient progresses further and further into, tumorigenesis.
That is the start of, tumor growth, massive tumor growth.
More and more of the body's resources are taken.
For example, one of the more popular drugs, and in my opinion, the most potent drug, to stop cancer, is a drug that ce_ tells the body not to supply blood to the tumor.
A tumor, is a very very greedy consumer of the body's resources.
It, uh, it actually excretes chemicals that tells the body to give it more blood, and to grow new blood vessels within the body.
Such that it can supply the tumor with more nutrient, more blood and more oxygen, such that it can continue to grow, unregulated.
New drugs have counteracted these tumor chemicals.
And have essentially been able to destroy the tumor’s ability to get new blood lines.
These chemicals are far more effective than the former toxic chemicals that are involved in modern day chemotherapy.
Whose sole purpose is to destroy, the tumor cell through using_ by the use of toxins that kill all cells in the region around the tumor.
Modern day chemotherapy, uses drugs that destroy the D-N-A, of cells.
The reason why this makes sense, is because tumor cells divide and grow more rapidly, than healthy cells.
Therefore using a chemical that stops its ability to grow and to divide and use its D-N-A properly will kill_ will harm the tumor much more... Per capita hahm than more harm, uh, healthy cells.
But nevertheless the side effects are destroying healthy cells, destroy healthy tissues, and therefore lead to sicker patients.
Leave_ also leave, uh, particularly in blood borne cancers the ability, um, for the chemotherapy to destroy the patient's immune system, leaving the patient vulnerable, uh, to infections from opportunistic er pathogens like pneumonia, for example.
A very very popular microbe that exists even within hospital ventilators.
Modern chemotherapy therefore, must look, to more tumor specific drugs, to destroy, uh, tumors and rid us of the scourge of cancer."
"What is usually meant by classical music, um, normally is a_ is all that sort of music, which is, uh, not pop, nor po_ nor rock, nor jazz.
I_ basically, all th_ all educated, or what is sort of educated elite music.
But, in, in, in, reality classical music, uh, technically speaking, is just, uh, refers to very, very limited historical period.
Which goes from the last decades of the eighteenth century, until the early_ until two or three decades of the nineteenth century.
So, it's just, uh, fifty years perhaps.
And comprises work such as those of Haydn which was the_ which is_ which has had to the beginner of classical music_ classical music.
And, Mozart_ Mozart first of all is the bulk.
M- most of that constitutes_ uh, most of the music constitutes as the bulk of classical music.
And then, Beethoven is, uh, um, last representative of classical music.
And i- i- the last works of Beethoven_ Beethoven by most, uh, specialists, are not regarded as anymore classical.
But they just_ they, they already forestall what is the_ what is then to be recognised as romantic, the romantic movement.
The_ that can be ascribe to the romantic, uh, um, period.
In such_ in some terMs but_ with_ what we mean with classical music.
I mean, uh, more, more technically speaking is, um... Is the de_ definition of a very_ of a very, um, tight_ tightly_ tight form.
Which does not anymore need_ it doesn't need_ it does not need anymore a, a connection to a text to be meaningful.
And, which, which builds up its own music_ it's mu_ it's own discourse.
For example we have a theme, a development, and, and, another theme, another unfolding.
And then we have a, sort of clashing of these two themes, which, uh, uh, which creates contrast.
And we have sort of_ of discourse which_ which can, or can_ may or may not be linked to something external.
But even if you do not not so_ do_ i- if y_ if you do not link to anything_ to any, uh, symbolic discourse.
It's, uh, it makes_ it still makes a meaning in itself.
And it's on its own terMs which is a novelty in music_ musci actually.
Because, um, if, if instrumental music be_ started from the beginning.
I mean, uh, uh, strong productional instrumental music, started in the beg_ uh, at the e_ during the end of, of the seventeenth century.
Not before the, um, the end of the eighteenth century.
A cla_ instrumental music was able to prevail against opera.
Which was a, um, mainstream musical practice.
Because, it was the meaningful one.
Because it, it dealt with stories, with, uh, plots.
Which we_ which were, which were able to, to, uh, um_ enticed or interested people.
And even if the_ in the end they, they listened to the singers.
To the_ to the unfolding of their voices, to their vitrolity, uh, this was done, with the aid of words.
If they're done_ being_ without words perhaps it wouldn't have done_ it wouldn't make_ have done in any sense of it.
But, whereas listeners were more prepared_ um, even surprisingly to, um, um, to get... Uh, to acquire the meaning of classical music.
Philosophers, um, and uh, uh, and I would say, um, this, um, for the first musicologists were not so favourable to it.
Because, they said, uh, that since music doesn't_ did not contain any reference to words.
To the logos, the_ they thought that it was meaningless.
It was, uh, it was just the_ sort of pleasantry.
But it didn't mea_ it didn't convey anything, meaningful.
And so, uh, uh... The_ where_ th- the mainstream philosophical word of the_ of the age.
Which was, uh, um, which, uh, which was bas_ basically linked with French culture.
It_ th_ al_ almost, almost unanimously rejected pu_ purely instrumental music.
And even, and even a_ a strong, um, so, su- su- such an important writer as Goethe, who was not French, he's German.
But, uh, he was a- a- a- very strong representative of classical culture.
If not musical.
Uh, was_ was very, uh, uh, was very_ di_ didn't_ it didn't really still favourably react, uh, towards classical music.
And he was still linked to music with words.
Because for him it was the meaningful one, and_ and, um, ye_ the, the end of classical music was th_ was when the dissolution of these, um, tight and sel_ a- and self, um, self-contained structure, uh, beg_ began to dis_ to dissolve, and, uh, other, um, and, and when_ especially when, uh, tha_ that this tonal cohesive_ to_ tonal cohesion was, uh, um, uh, was destroyed by, by other_ by other meanings.

"Much has been made, of the recent discovery or the recent, development of the technology by I- Ian Lomas groupi-  in Scotland, and the replication of the technique of cloning.
Um, in other venues including Hawaii, um, with regard to mice.
And (hmph) and to, uh, more dubious experiment down in South Korea.
Cloning has occupied the minds of, of Westerners, particularly Americans.
But the entire idea that now a living being, can be fully replicated.
At least its genome and its physiology can be completely replicated.
The technique although incredibly powerful, is surprisingly simple.
It merely involves removing the nucleus_ that is, the genetic information of a living cell.
And then placing this genetic information within the shell of an egg.
The egg of a female animal, be it human being, a sheep or a mouse can be removed from the uterus or from_ directly from the ovary of a female animal_  have the genetic information within that egg removed, and then replaced by the genetic information, from an already existing, living organism.
The egg can then be implanted into the uterus of the original female or another, uh... Surrogate female.
And then allowed to implant in the uterus and then grow to a full fetus.
The fetus as produced will be an exact genetic copy of the living, of the living being.
Of course this has scared quite a lot, um, of religious groups, particularly fundamentalist groups who are very afraid that this violates the sacrosanctity of life.
The ability to now take, a human being_ most importantly, not so much an animal, animals can be um_ have been cloned for years.
And the benefits of cloning animal cells, at a very small level have been used by, the agricultural, um, industries within Western Europe and the United States, um, since the nineteen-seventies.
The idea of cloning a human being is very much more, uh, controversial.
And the fact that it has been done to a limited extent in East Asia.
Even though evidence is ver- very scarce.
Um, shows that the_ it can be done and most likely will be done.
The controversy then becomes, what does cloning really mean for us.
What can cloning offer.
Cloning does offer, the ability, to... If one is, is willing hahm, and if one is really, shall we say, interested in patterns of social engineering, um, use cloning for the benefits of, of, psy- psychological experiments.
Um, one now takes a, a,  living being_ an intelligent living being, that is the exact genetic copy of one that already exists.
And then see how ,the environment in which that being is raised, fundamentally changes that person's personality.
The question therefore is, even though we have clones_ and this must be made abundantly clear to the layman_ even though one is ju_ a directly genetic or physiological copy of an already existing human being.
In no way are you the exact same being.
Obviously your environment_ obviously experiences that the cloned being will have, in his or her lifetime will obviously make him or her, radically different from the existing being from whence, he or she came.
This is in no way to justify human cloning.
There are other, uh, moral dilemma_ dilemmas that are, um, bringing_ that can be brought to bear upon this.
Do we clone a human being, uh, merely for experimentation.
This seems very barbaric in light of the holocaust and, uh, in light of, um, the genetic engineering or eugenics movement, um, at the beginning of this century.
So this is_ this brings up entire specters of, of totalitarian social control that, many who are interested in freedom and liberty obviously are, are, are very frightened of.
Um, more to, more to bear even though the science is available_ this doesn't necessary justify our use of it.
The science may be beneficial, uh, to the extent to which a cloned fetus for example, um, can be_ um, can be given to couples that are infertile.
Couples that have lost a child very early in pregnancy or have lerst_ lost a child, um, when they are very young.
And a lot of couples especially in the United States of America have actually signed up, at one hundred and fifty thousand dollars an experiment.
To have children, um, that were dead or that died rather early in pregnancy, or,or, died immediately after birth.
Or those couples that are infertile_ um er have signed up to have children via clones.
Usually because the male within the relationship is sterile.
Um, these may be beneficial to some couples, um, and may be cloning_ the future of human cloning may indeed have only this aspect, um, in its application to society in general.
The moral dilemma_ the moral dilemmas that are facing us therefore, um, one must ask several questions.
First of all who should handle these questions.
Should these be left to the scientific community.
Should this be left to the market.
Should this be put in the hands of, of government.
So the cloning technology, though very powerful, though very simple, um, will shape public debate not only in terms of where science, where biological science moves, but also, um, how we approach ethics in technology in general."
"Our group compare, um, cash flow of Johnson and Johnson, and Bristol Myers Squib.
Johnson  Johnson is a well known, name for ma- many people here.
Like, uh, Tylenol like Band-Aid adhesive bandages.
Johnson and Johnson ranks as the largest and the most divers- diversified health care company in the world.
Today J and J offers, an impressive list of blockbuster, prescription drugs, professional products and, uh, broadest line of health related cust- consumer products.
Foreign business accounted for fifty percent of sales and forty three percent of profits, in nineteen ninety-six.
Sales and earnings, in nineteen-ninety-six, were divided, divided in pharmaceuticals professional and consumer products.
As of nineteen ninety-six Johnson and Johnson has eighty-nine-thousand three hundred employees.
One hundred three_ one hundred-thirty-eight thousand five-hundred stockholders, and more than one hundred and seventy operation companies in fifty countries around the world.
Selling products in more than one hundred and seventy-five countries.
The pharmaceutical segment represents over fifty percent of operation profit, for all segments.
The pharmaceutical seg- segments principle worldwide franchisees, are in the allergy, antibacterial, anti-fungal, biotech central nervous system contra- acc- acceptive  [means contraceptive], gastrointestinal and immune biology fields.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in nineteen ninety-six were, seven point one nine billion, an increase of fourteen point six percent over nineteen-ninety-five.
Bristol and Bristol Myers Squib is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical concerns.
With important drugs in key cardiovas- vascular anti-infective, anticancer and other areas.
It also has interest in infant, nutritionals, nonprescription medications, medical devices and toiletries.
Foreign business accounted for forty-three percent of sales and thirty-seven per cent of profits in nineteen-ninety-six.
Sales and earnings, in nineteen-ninety-six were divided in, uh, pharmaceutical products.
Nonprescription health products, medical devices and toiletries and beauty aids.
As of nineteen-ninety-six, Bristol Myers Squib company has fifty-one thousand, two hundred employees.
And a hundred and thirty-three thousand six-hundred forty, forty shareholders.
The pharmaceutical products segment which is the company's largest segment, at fifty-eight percent of total company sales, increased eleven per cent to eight point seven oh two billion, in nineteen ninety-six.
Pharmaceutical products include the prescription medicals many cardiovascular anticancer and anti-infective drugs, which comprise about thirty percent, twenty- five percent and twenty respectfully.
In nineteen ninety six of the segment sales central nervous system drugs and the other pharmaceutical products.
From the cash flow statement... We, we have a question.
Which is that, is cash from operations sufficient for paying continuing use of cash.
If no.
What other sources of cash, would the firm be able to rely on this source in the future period.
Johnson and Johnson's cash from operations is sufficient.
However, if it wasn't total unused credit available to the company is approximately three point three billion.
Bristol Myers Squib cash from operations are insufficient.
Bristol Myers Squib advanced in its annual report that it includes time deposits and marketable securities, when considering its principle measures of liquidity.
Which when combined are adequate to cover continuing use of cash.
Cash provided from operation, continued to be the primary source of funding for research and development, capital spending and dividend payouts.
A bank loan officer wants to ensure, that if money was lent to either company, they will be able to service the debt without comprising continuing_ continuous use of cash.
Analysis indicates that Johnson and Johnson out performs Bristol Myers in this category.
We can see that Johnson and Johnson has surplus, of cash whilst Bristol Myers is negative."
"The development of both, quantum theory, and computer science... Though occurring within the physics and mathematics communities, have developed to a large extent without communicating with each other.
Very interestingly, we have found that within biology, and within, the idea of developing new drugs, within the field of medicine.
That these two great revolutions and science can be brought together, and aid us in actually fighting, one of the great battles of all science, that is combating disease.
How does one do this.
The advent of quantum theory has helped us actually look at, not only atoMs  not looking at just molecules, but atoms and even subatomic particles.
Looking at the way even electrons behave, over time.
Computer science has given us, more and more powerful computers with which to do the very, very complicated calculations, that are needed in order to understand how, atoms, subatomic particles and particularly electrons, actually move within the structure of very very complicated much larger, uh, molecules.
Within computer aided drug design, a brand new field, a field that is flourishing, particularly within Japan, particularly within Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
Such incredibly powerful computer technology has now been integrated fully.
And with more and more uh powerful computing and such revolutions as fuzzy logic.
And revolutions such as parallel computing.
Wherein millions, if not billions of calculations can be done simultaneously.
These have allowed us.
To look at very, very complicated molecules.
The molecules within the body that are the cause of disease, and look at the way they behave over time.
</P<>the old means of designing drugs were very inefficient.
They would involve, chemists, looking at nature to a large extent to see how nature behaves.
What kind of chemicals, um, do plants and animals use to defend themselves from infection naturally.
The chemist would then, attempt to mimic the behavior of these chemicals in the laboratory.
A second method that chemists would use was a very very famous one that has, been with us since the advent of rationality in man.
Otherwise known as trial and error.
The focus would be on developing large, incredibly large volumes of nontoxic or semi-toxic chemicals.
And then testing them on laboratory animals.
This form of, irrational drug design was used for a very long time and proved to be actually quite efficient_ inefficient.
The, point can best be illustrated by some of the more fortuitous discoveries of antibiotics.
For instance, the work of, the rather famous Sir Alexander Fleming.
Um, which was nonetheless an extremely fortuitous discovery.
Fleming in an attempt to grow bacteria on, on plates, realized that he had left his bacterial plates out a little too long on the bench.
He came the next morning, trudging into lab to find mold growing on his bacterial plates.
An unperceptive scientist would have thought that this was just yet another failed experiment.
Moldy plates.
Bad results.
Instead, what Fleming observed was an- absolutely an essential discovery for all of medicine.
He looked at the plate and realized that on the plates that were not spoiled, his bacterium, grew and were quite happy.
When he looked at his moldy plates on the other hand his bacteria, were not happy at all.
Instead in the region of which the mold was growing, a very large ring of barren space was open.
Meaning that the bacteria had been killed.
Immediately recognizing the possibility that, the fungus was, d- excreting some chemical that was killing the bacteria.
Fleming went to his associates, and asked, ""what is what is it.
What can we take from the fungus.
What chemical can we find, that mimics this ability to destroy all the bacteria on my plate.
If we can master that we can definitely be able to find one, uh, sort of chemical may be an assortment of chemicals, from different species of fungus, that can allow us to combat bacterial infection.""  Fleming's discovery was not actually brought to bear until many decades later, when Chain and Florey, then who then who dug up his old paper, published in rather an obscure journal.
From uh_ in which he was the first author and then preceded to isolate penicillin.
From penicillin, came an assortment of other, antibiotics or, fungal chemicals, that can be used to destroy or kill bacteria.
The attempt by scientists, um, since Robert Woodward and other great organic chemists, who showed that synthetic organic chemistry could also, produce antibiotics.
The_ now the, penchant has been to take variations, on fungal chemicals and synthesize them in the laboratory.
For the most part, despite the, move towards rational drug design.
Or the in words of Nobel Prize winner E J Cory, ""rational synthesis.""  the, the ability for us to build, up our stock pile of antibiotics has been very very slow in coming.
In fact, the ability for us to continue to mount a, very potent offensive against bacterial infection by continuously developing new antibiotics has slowed considerably.
Given to the point, that certain forms of tuberculosis once considered to have been wiped out, uh, among mankind  have now originated in some urban populations even in the West.
They have always been prevalent to some extent within the, the larger cities of the third world.
But now um even in societies where we do have exposure to the, the panoply of antibiotics.
Certain forms of, tuberculosis and certain forms of vir- bacterial meningitis and bacterial encephalitis have also come back to, besiege the Western populations, as more and more bacterium become immune to to the antibiotics.
The need therefore, is to be able to look at what, molecules exist within, our enemies the bacterium.
To do this we need very potent computers.
We need the ability to go and look and the macromolecule and see the way it behaves.
Instead of attempting to mimic what nature has, developed, look for brand new ways of developing very novel chemicals that may not exist in nature.
But instead conform to the laws of quantum theory using the extremely potent computers that we have at our, at our disposal.
In so doing we can now use, multiple calculations and in a very aggressive attack in developing new organic molecules that can sit within let's say a bacterial protein that is, causing disease, within our bodies and develop something that will destroy it.
Either inhibit its function, uh, render it insoluble, such that it comes out of solution and is secre- excreted from the body, or destroys the bacterium before it can produce the, the toxic protein.
These, would take centuries of fortuitous experiments to find from nature.
The benefit of computer science and the use of quantum theory, to do_ to accelerate the process of discovery.
To sift through all of the possibilities that nature could possibly, give us, for new drugs to combat infection.
Um, gives us the opportunity to stay, multiple steps, may be not just one step ahead of disease, but multiple steps ahead of disease.
And the potent_ with more powerful computers as we focus on, uh, moving away from, um, silicone based computers to, uh, optical computers, using optical memory, using fuzzy logic, um, to a much wider extent other than for purposes of defense, and we now have them for purposes of developing drugs for medicines.
And as we, we find and simplify, um, some of the equations otherwise known as wave functions within quantum theory.
As we make them simpler, as we make code, computer code that is simpler and have more powerful computers.
We can therefore uh now produce drugs um,too a much more rapid extent.
This is a burgeoning field.
And it is a field that offers great rewards.
To the ambitious student who wants to cure disease.
Who wants to fight, um, against all of the afflictions, that are now, um, besetting mankind. "
"The history of molecular biology can, begotten_ be_ essentially begun with the idea of, from whence did, um, heredity come.
Was it originally an ethos.
Was it a spirit.
Or, um, did it have a molecular basis.
And for quite a long time, many biologists honestly thought that heredity originated in proteins.
And several experiments, mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom actually showed that nucleic acids, and not proteins are actually the source of heredity.
All of this, is key to understanding today's recombinant D-N-A technology.
And all of the revolutions that are involved in modern day genetics.
We can hon- honestly begin at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City with Oswald Avery, and Chargaff.
Oswald Avery was the first to actually show, that D-N-A or nucleic acid heretofore believed to be just an extraneous bio synthetic by-product of the body's physiology.
Um, was responsib- was actually responsible for D-N-A.
Avery's original experiment showed that if one, uh, were to take D-N-A out of a frog egg.
Remove its D-N-A completely through chemical means and then allow the frog egg to generate or germinate, it couldn't form a frog.
Whereas if the proteins in its nucleus, the center of the cell where in all of  purportedly the heredity information was stored, were removed, but the nucleic acids remained, the frog could develop normally.
Although Avery, uh, did the crucial experiment that showed that D-N-A was of course the source of heredity, for all living things, never won the Nobel prize.
(Chargoff) was yet another_ was an East_ was an Eastern European scientist who came to the Rockefeller Institute in, in New York as well.
And showed that, that D-N-A in and of itself had all of the characteristics that are actually needed for heredity.
It provided information, at a level of very low entropy, that is very low disorder.
It could show the repeating patterns, that there was enough uh, variability in the sequence of D-N-A_ in the chemicals that are contained within D-N-A, to provide information for even extremely complex living organisms, from very basic yeast, to, human beings that have the ability to think.
A very exciting idea indeed.
But no one could really honestly think of the mechanisms of heredity, until the Englishman, Francis Crick and the American James Dewey Watson, actually discovered the structure of D-N-A.
Not through any, uh, direct means, not through x-ray crystallography, not through chemical, uh, identification, or any of the modern day techniques, um, that, uh, we use.
Or even the techniques that were contemporary to them, developed by Bragg, um, and Rosalind Franklin.
But instead used very simple stick and ball models, to come up with the idea that D-N-A could, first of all by separating its two strands, opening up, uh, to the cellular environment, provide the information that was necessary for the machinery within living things, to take its information and turn it, turn it to the vital structural proteins, and vital enzymes that, organisms need to just survive.
The next step, once we have the idea that D-N-A, has a given structure and has information, um, inherent within its structure.
That is it can give to the cell, um, um, through a, um, through a functional means.
We have to understand how we can manipulate it.
This revolution came back actually in the nineteen-seventies with Daniel Nathans and his group, at the Johns Hopkins University.
Who discovered that bacteria have very interesting enzymes, that allow them to destroy the D-N-A of viruses that infect them.
These enzymes referred to as, restriction enzymes, allow the bacterium to go and chew up enemy D-N-A.
Luckily, molecular biologists realized that these very enzymes could allow them to manipulate the D-N-A, in very interesting ways.
Because of the nature of the enzyme, it will look at D-N-A specific codes within D-N-A.
And clip only those specific codes, such that one can now cut and paste, so to speak, using the lingo of modern day Macintosh or, uh, personal computer technology, um, could cut and paste D-N-A and manipulate it.
Such that one could get the information from the D-N-A that one actually wants.
Um, this discovery of restriction enzymes along with the discovery of the structure of D-N-A_ these two discoveries were actually awarded the Nobel prize.
The importance of restriction enzymes, and the importance of research that had been do uh, has been done since the nineteen-seventies, um, is crucial to recombinant D-N-A technology.
, Such as the idea that D-N-A that has been manipulated in the test tube for the use of restriction enzymes can now be introduced into cells.
And that these cells can therefore change their entire physiology, just on the basis of a simple man-made manipulation of their genetic information, has essentially caused the, massive explosion of biotechnology.
This more important than anything else, um, of all of the aspects of the revolution, of molecular biology_ the economic aspect (hahm)um, has been of great interest of industry and therefore has caused a massive influx of funds, into molecular biology and has i- introduced further innovation."
"History's a difficult subject.
Practically, everyone who, specialised in other subjects, will say, 'what a daft thing to say.
What, what an appalling, banal thing to say.
It's just a truism.
Because my subject's difficult as well.
I'm a physicist.
Or I'm a, a medical doctor.
' You know, 'if you think history's difficult let me tell you about mine.
'Okay.
But, let me then, perhaps more intelligently try, and, detail in what way history is a difficult subject.
If you are, a medical doctor, um, a surgeon performing an operation, on someone's chest, for example.
Or, even_ or, a medical researcher discovering new things about, cancer cells, circulation of the blood.
Um, your own political and social views and scale of values, need not enter in.
Sometimes they do.
But, strictly speaking, they need not.
Whether the surgeon operating on you, is, um, a Trotskyist.
Or, um, a rather right-wing Tory.
Um, it doesn't matter as long as he's a conscientious, um, medical man.
You know, his co_ his competence can be divorced from his political views.
And the same way, if I look out, of the window, and see a paving stone in the garden.
That can be analysed and examined by a geologist, or a chemist, without really his own political views, or his  interests getting in the way.
Um, the problem with history, is you have, a researcher, um, an academic, whatever, historian, who is a human being, at one point, in historical time.
Um, examining the activities, of a bunch of fellow human beings, at another point in historical time.
So, um, I'll come back to this later.
You have a young Marxist historian, in the, nineteen thirties, like Christopher Hill, who's still alive at the time I'm speaking.
Now an old gentleman, a later Master of Balliol.
Um, he was in the nineteen thirties, um, examining, and looking at the sixteen thirties.
The prelude to the Civil War in England.
Um, and he is a man of immense brilliance and ability in scholarship.
But the way he did it, is not the way we would do it now, sixty years later, nearly seventy years later, in fact.
Um, so, it's very hard, however much you try, to divorce, the moral values, the sheer interests, and conceptions.
Sheer assumptions, of your own time, from the period you're studying.
Um, in fact, one of the besetting sins of historians.
Which I always labour, to, um, bunches of students, is anachronism.
Let's examine this word.
It just means Greek, honour out of <em>chronos</em> time.
So, out of time.
And, the less interesting, definition of anachronism, uh, means out of time in an old fashioned way.
Um, you know, just old fashioned.
Like, um, I myself tend to wear a trilby hat, which was common in the fifties.
But looks quite anachronistic now, but I just like wearing it.
Or... I don't know, having, I can't think of, of_ I'm trying to think of some other things.
Having outdated views of how society is presently constituted.
Never mind, historically.
But the more interesting idea of anachronism, is when you read into a past age ideas, or obsessions, or attitudes, which were not around then.
Which belong to our age, or at least to a future age.
This can make for very lively, very amusing comedy on T-V.
The, the most obvious one, is Rowan Atkinson's 'Black Adder' [English television show].
Where Atkinson is pretending to be an Elizabethan courtier say.
And he keeps this up for awhile.
Then he suddenly turns round, and talks like, exactly like, an educated rather waspish man of the nineteen eighties.
Ha ha.
That sort of business.
Um, but it's done seriously by historians at times.
Um, unconsciously they, they read things back into the past, which weren't there.
And that is a besetting sin.
Uh, there's a more sophisticated view.
Um, we tend to also look, um, at the aspects of the past, which appeal to our age.
Um, to go through this very quickly, the nineteenth century, was concerned with state building.
Um, this comes from the German historians who admired the Prussian state, originally.
But, it spread to England.
There'd been a State in England, longer, um, than there had been_ the State of Prussia was rather new.
But, um, there'd been a Kingdom of England.
Now Kingdom of Great Britain, rather longer.
Certainly Kingdom of England.
So you didn't have to worry so much, perhaps about, the creation of the kingdom in the first place.
But, historians in the nineteenth century were very interested in the development of representative institutions.
Because that was, was_ happened in the nineteenth century.
The great Reform Bill of eighteen thirty-two.
The second one of eighteen sixty-seven.
More and more people getting the vote.
Their_ the, the final fate of the power of the monarchy.
So when they looked at the past, they tended to focus immensely, on, the, um, growth of Parliament.
Going back to the, late thirteenth century.
And the Civil War was a real sacred period.
As it was still when I was in postgraduate, you know.
Um, undergraduate, sorry.
Um, the idea that you finally depeat_ defeat a would-be absolutist King.
And, Charles the First, you cut his head off, in fact.
And because of that, you secure the idea_ the principle of representation.
Not democracy.
But, at least constitutional government.
The answerability of the executive to Parliament.
You manage to secure it in Britain for all times.
And then it gradually develops, between the sixteen eighties, and, um, on into the twentieth century.
You know, getting_ uh, constitutional government becomes, you know, goes from strength to strength.
Although, with checks on the way.
Combined with that, was a focus on the activities of great men.
Their other impulse, of course, the development of the British Empire.
That was looked at.
So, you focus on kings, politicians, i_ prime ministers etcetera.
Generals, etcetera.
They're the people who do things.
The mass of the people, what you call social history, economic history.
They're just there to be ruled.
In some ways, there, there is, um, a point in that, in a way.
You im_ um, someone who takes that view, could say, that well, there wasn't any democracy, much before, eighteen hundred.
So, um, whatever the mass of the people thought it wasn't too relevant.
They were just given orders.
So it makes sense to concentrate, on the five percent of the elite, who had real power, and real wealth.
We weren't liv_ we aren't living in, the age that we have now, where everyone has a vote.
So, it may be wrongheaded to be too obsessed what the, mass of seventeenth century peasants thought, or, did, or something.
I don't think anyone would quite take that attitude now.
But, anyway_ great deeds, great men.
The development of the state.
The development of Parliament, and the constitution in which you can reach back, even to the idea of the Anglo-Saxon Witten.
Which, nineteenth century historians thought was some sort of proto-parliament.
I_ um, uh, a lot of that is encapsulated in the Whig interpretation of history.
By the time you get to the young Christopher Hill of the nineteen thirties, you have the Marxist, or, economic interpretation of history.
Whereby, um, the specific events of actors.
Actors on the stage, Cromwell, Charles the First, William, John Pym, uh, for example.
Are considered, in a way, less important, than the socio-economic forces, um, behind them.
That they are spokesman, for... Very considerable socio-economic interests.
They don't just get up in the morning, and say, 'oh, well I think I'll be an absolute monarch today.
' Or, 'oh, I think I'll... Oh, I think I'll have a revolution today.
I'll, I'll send my servants around to, ask a few of the lads to meet down the tavern, and we'll have_ we'll plot a revolution.
' Ha ha.
You know, it isn't like that.
These are great seismic events.
Um, able individuals get thrown up, like Cromwell, or Pym.
Because you need people who can lead these things.
Or, Lord Fairfax.
For a long time Cromwell's superior as army commander a forgotten figure.
Figures who are not so able, but have inherited their position, like Charles the First.
Uh, Charles the First was a very cultured gentleman, connoisseur of the arts, not so good as a politician.
Um, figures who're not so able, mismanage events, and get themselves into the situation, where they fail to avoid an earthquake.
So individuals do count.
But, basically, you're going to have the earthquake.
The eruption of Vesuvius, the eruption of Mount Etna, anyway.
Ha.
Um, another, figure who gets, of course, very caught up, and doesn't know what to do about it, is the hapless, another king that lost his head, Louis the Sixteenth of France.
And, then again the ultimate Marxist Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in nineteen seventeen, the Tzar.
Looked what happens to the Tzar and his family.
But individuals don't count for so much.
Although the communists tend to contradict that by, um, giving canonisation to Lenin, and then for a time to Stalin, but that is a bit of a contradiction.
Um, in, in the Marxist interpretation it's great socio-economic, um, attitudes, um, uh, movements.
But then, in the nineteen fifties and sixties, there's a reaction against this.
The Marxist interpretation is all down to economic change.
So, change in economy, um, combined with change in technology, produces new social classes.
They demand their place in the sub, because they've got their power.
So the old order must yield place to new.
There is something in that.
There is something in the Whig interpretation.
But, by the ni_ late, early nineteen sixties, Lauren Stone, in his, um, <em>Decline of the Aristocracy</em>.
The English aristocracy, in the seventeenth century, by the way.
Refer to all this as the clumsy old Marxist bulldozer.
He obviously thought Marxism was, destructive and very unsubtle.
And that something which said_ explained everything by economics, explained little.
So, you look then on social and psychological factors.
You also, um, the_ now history is terribly variant.
But I would say, one dominant theme is more sociological, than simply Marxist economics.
I myself like that.
I find it very useful.
When you_ I've looked of course at present day economics.
I'm no authority on it.
But, I've often discovered that, present day sociologists, studying the present day.
Often take five years, and, a hundred thousand dollars, or something, to tell you there's a pawn shop on the corner.
Which you knew all the time, and you know why people go there, because they probably need to pawn things.
Ha ha.
Um, this isn't always the case.
Sometimes, sociologists get rid of, um, received values, or, or received ideas about how certain groups of people think.
I-e that all teachers are raving lefties, or something.
Which just isn't true.
Um, but i, I do find, that if you take sociological, and to some degree anthropological techniques, and put them back, ask the same questions, that a sociologist would ask of, us, or someone else living today.
Put them back three hundred years, and ask those questions as far as you can.
Then, um, it can be, um, extremely useful, much more illuminating.
O_ or greater emphasis is given today to the mind in history.
Whereas a Marxist might say that um, religious, um, values, or other, um, conceptions, th_ that people are claiming.
You know, in the Civil War people claimed they were fighting about religion.
Puritanism versus High Anglicanism, or whatever.
Um, Marxist in nineteen thirty would have said, 'oh, they might have believed it was a_' but I'm not sure if all of them even believed it.
It was just a cover for their economic ambitions.
We don't believe that now.
We don't think that, seventeenth century per_ people were just totally rational <em>homo economicus</em>, economic man if you like, were just saying, 'well, I want to make more money.
I want to secure my property.
But I have to use religious language to do it.
' They genuinely, integrated the religious outlook with their other conceptions.
And, and if you try and put economic, um, motives over there, and religious motives, over there.
You're really behaving not like a seventeenth century person, but like us.
Where we have a tendency, it, it's a good thing in a way.
It leads to greater tolerance.
To say that whatever a person's religion is, whether he is a Quaker, a Buddhist, a Roman Catholic, that's his private affair.
Rather li_ rather like his sex life.
While when we're at work, when we're doing business etcetera, um, we focus on business, or politics, or economics and religion has nothing to do with it.
Well, seventeenth, or sixteenth century people just didn't think like that.
There was a tendency for Marxist historians early in this century to make them think like that.
Um, histor_ history now, and the approach to history has become more complicated than ever.
Because, although I've been rather facilely knocking, say, the Marxist interpretation, the Whig interpretation.
I mean quite a lot of it is valuable.
What is not valuable, is to force everything into that corset.
Everything into constitutional development.
As the great Victorian historian, Thomas Macaulay did, everything into a sophisticated, Marxist interpretation as the young Christopher Hill, who's still with us did.
But you_ the_ certain of what the- their insights are obviously still valid.
And then, we've added everything else.
We've borrowed techniques from sociology, anthropology.
We've restored the role of religion.
<Em>mentalite</em> you know, that what people think, what people say, are their values.
You should believe them really.
They're probably being quite sincere, when they say, 'i'm dying for the Protestant/Catholic religion.
' That's what they mean.
Um, it's not just an outcrop of um, social or economic change.
Okay, that could feed into it.
So, really historiography, the approach to history, and the tools you use.
The analytical tools, have become more complicated than ever.
And it's rather difficult to deal with them all.
One longs for the time when history_ sometimes one longs, sneekingly, for the time when history was simply past politics, and constitution development.
And you could ignore_ you could ignore the attitudes and mentalities of the average person.
Um, at least it made life simpler.
But, there are of course, political and constitutional historians, around today.
But can they go back to the model of Macaulay, or nineteenth century people.
No they can't.
They have to put their politics, and constitutional development in a framework of the social attitudes, and the mentalities of the time.
You know, they have to take_ um, they have to put in the social.
Indeed sociological dimension themselves.
This is a great advance, because, although I did well at history at A-Level in school, I used to ask questions sometimes, um, what was the difference.
Sometimes the way it was presented.
We did Charles the First, and Cromwell.
Um, they were presented a bit like, um, people of the nineteen sixties in fancy dress.
We didn't really get the idea of differentness.
The differentness of outlook, the difference of mentality, enough.
We got it a bit.
But not enough.
You know, that they were taking political decisions, as a contemporary politician might.
And I got more of the sociological histories, from doing A-Level English.
Social history_ sorry.
And reading Shakespeare, and the notes at the back, the additions at the back, used to talk about how, um, great Elizabethan aristocrats would entertain three hundred people in their houses to, um, bar_ barrels of beef.
And, uh, have lots of clients, and hangers on, and servants.
I used to say this is fascinating, I'd like to investigate this sort of history.
But ironically it was put on, as, uh, editorial notes to Shakespeare, ha ha, in those days.
Of course, a year or so later, Lawrence Stone's, seminal work <em>The Decline of the Aristocracy</em>, actually dealt with that sort of thing.
The structure, of the aristocracy, and how they lived.
And, um, that has, you know, given a huge boost to that whole area of history.
How people lived.
It needn't be the aristocracy.
But, you know, how peopled lived, and, um, their mentalities, everything like that."
"I was born just after the war.
And, for, me and my contemporaries, Hitler was the ultimate bogey figure.
The incarnation of the devil.
And, um, all our parents had been involved in the war in one way or another.
And never stopped talking about him.
So for, kids growing up in the fifties.
Even kids who would not have regarded themselves, as particularly intellectual, or academic.
We had a rather good working knowledge of, Hitler, and his confederates.
And of the battles and campaigns of the Second World War.
Um, I find that now, um, I have a reasonably academic, fourteen-year-old son.
And I find that with him, and his contemporaries, Hitler's faded into being rather a remote figure.
Say, as Napoleon might have been when we were kids.
In fact, we're probably in time, closer even to the Kaiser's Germany, than kids of the nineteen-nineties are to, Hitler's Germany.
But, I'd like to, transpose that idea, of Hitler as the ultimate bogey-figure, to, a rather more sophisticated.
Or, rather more crucial, level.
Um, to look at his role, only half-acknowledged, in the Cold War.
The other thing, of course, that was familiar to anyone who was growing up in the nineteen fifties, and indeed, probably to most people alive today, even.
Because it went on 'till the_ nineteen, late nineteen eighties, was the Cold War.
Now, the Cold War, you might say.
Rose up on the ushers of Hitler, you know, Hitler was what the Russians, and the West could ultimately agree on.
That they had to sink their considerable differences, to defeat the Nazis.
[Throat clear] and surely, all they were doing was squabbling about the Nazi inheritance.
But, they divided Europe into two armed camps.
But I think the experience of fighting Hitler, um, and the Nazis was, so profound, particularly for the Soviet Union.
That, during the Cold War, um, the Nazi motif, coloured each side's perception of each other.
And, we've all_ in the West we've all_ we all lived through the propaganda that, the Communist Regime with their occupation of Eastern Europe, were the heirs of the Nazis.
Okay.
Unless you were a complete, complete illiterate.
Or, completely ideologically unsophisticated.
You realised that the ideology, of, the Soviet Union, was, rather different from the Nazi ideology.
But, you could say, at a sort of semi-sophisticated level, 'yes, but the methods are the same.
And the fact that you have one ideology, which everyone must obey, um, is similar.
And, you know, they have secret police armies, and, you know, sort of, um, concentration camps, and the rest of it.
'Um, so that was often the way the West looked at the Soviet Union.
Now, how much truth was there in it.
Or how valid was this comparison, between the Soviets and, the, the Nazis of a decade or so earlier.
Well, you can say there were certain, um, even if you, tried_ put the propaganda aside.
You can say, there were certain plausible analogies.
Um, Stalin, for example, although a different sort of dictator.
Could even be argued to have been worse than Hitler.
In the sense that he, lived longer, had more time to kill people.
He had, even in the nineteen thirties, his concentration camps, is often forgotten, were in fact much bigger, and contained many more people, than Hitler's did in the nineteen thirties.
Note, I'm not talking about the war period.
Um, there's that sort of thing.
And it's true that the Soviet Union was, totalitarian.
But, of course, to, compare the Nazi regime, to the Soviet regime, um, is, in many ways, many important ways, of course, very misleading.
Uh... Uh, perhaps even Stalin, an anecdote about Stalin, may illustrate this.
That um, sometime in the early fifties, or whatever, Stalin received Eden, who was either_ Anthony Eden, who was either a British foreign minister, British shadow foreign minister.
This was at a time, of the greatest_ just after the greatest expansion of Soviet Russia, taking over from Hitler, if you like, in Eastern Europe.
And, there're things like the blockade of Berlin.
Which had been seen of.
And Stalin said to Hitler.
Sta_ sorry, I'll start again.
Stalin said to Eden, 'you think I'm just like Hitler, don't you.
But, I'm not, I know when to stop.
' And that is true.
I think Stalin had, learnt, the lesson from Hitler.
That what had brought Hitler down, was not stopping.
If you bother_ if we bother to look at it, Hitler, you see was astonishingly successful, up to the t- t- and including the take-over of Czechoslovakia, or Prague.
Not just Munich, but the take-over of the Czech parts of Bohemian Moravia, in 1939, he'd got away with everything.
Then the invasion of Poland he fo_ in the end, he found he'd bitten off more than he could chew.
So I think was learning from that.
Stalin would try it on.
He did the blockade at Berlin, in 1948.
Trying to force the Western Allies, out of Western Berlin.
I.
E.
Take over the whole city.
Although by the agreement made a couple of years earlier with the Russians, they had a perfect right to be there.
On the other hand, he gave up, when he found it wouldn't work.
Um, another thing, is that Stalin did not back the Greek Communists in the civil war going on in the late forties, same time to the hype.
Because there had been an agreement, that the Russians, could take over, say, essentially, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania.
But, Greece would remain in the Western sphere of influence.
And, also Stalin knew, how_ because of the experience of fighting the Nazis, which was_ had a devastating effect on the Soviet Union, that there could be no war.
Um, th_ that, um, a war with the West, might finish Russia off.
But have no good effect on the West, obviously.
With Russia to the point, right to the end.
[Throat clear] excuse me, what about um, uh, so that is the, the colouring of the Western perception of Russia by the Nazi experience.
Is probably, as exaggerated, what did the Russians think.
Well, to the Russians, invasion comes from the West.
And it had come several times, um, you know, in two long lives.
You start off with the Napoleonic Invasion, eighteen eleven.
You get the Crimean War, eighteen fifty-four, fifty-six.
You get the intervention of the Western powers, and the Japanese, against the Bolshevik Revolution, nineteen eighteen, twenty-one.
Then you get the great revanchist German invasion_ oh, I should have mentioned, sorry, that even before the Bolshevik Revolution, the Germans, had of course, imperial Germany had invaded Russia.
Um, and in fact, the imperial Germans won on the Russian front.
Uh, which is one reason why Hitler's gamble twenty-five years later, wasn't so crazy.
Um, imperial Germany had forced the treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the, new Bolshevik Regime in nineteen eighteen.
The reason why this didn't last is the Germans lost overall on the Western front.
Anyway, and then finally, you get, this ver_ the most savage invasion of all, the Nazi Invasion.
Though, the West feared_ the_ Russia feared, that the West might do the same thing again.
And they_ it was not too difficult to assimilate, um, Hitler's regime to, the more respectable, seemingly, western bourgeois democracies, which succeeded, even in Germany, America, France.
Why was that.
The average westerner would be horrified to be assimilated to Hitler.
But, you've got to look at things from the communist point of view.
The communists had their own sort of proved_ crude propaganda.
Anyone who wasn't a communist, was really a social fascist.
And democratic socialists, like the Labour Party or the German Social Democratic Party, were considered the worst of all.
Because, while any intelligent worker could see that a, capitalist party, like the Tories, were capitalist, and behave accordingly.
And the Labour Party, or the Germanist SPD were deceiving the workers with false socialism.
They were false prophets, just_ while really being lackeys for the capitalists.
So, the communists had this idea of a social fascist.
And they would point out, 'well, um, the West is essentially capitalist, with a facade of liberal participated democracy.
' But then, Hitler's regime, um, according to communist ideas, was really, a desperate attempt to shore up German capitalism.
And, German capitalism, and rich people flourished under Hitler.
So, they would regard, um, Nazism, as an extreme attempt to defend anticommunist values.
Um, when, when, i-e when, you can no longer be respectable, and have a facade of bourgeois democracy.
You go to outright fascism.
But, really, what was there before Hitler, and in the West, what was there after Hitler.
The capitalist regimes, would be considered, to be, a softer, more civilised version of fascism.
They certainly, were not bringing social justice, Soviet style, as the Soviets conceived it.
And, really, their hatred of communism, was not much, uh, less than Hitler's.
In fact there's some objective verification, if you've heard American republicans, ha ha, talk about communism.
Um, and, um, so they regarded western democracies as a hypocritic_ hypocritical facade.
Um, the Russians, would also point to the fact, that in Germany itself, um, hoards of people who'd collaborated, very actively with the, Nazi regime, in fact had been Nazi Party members, had been sanitised, dusted down, and given important positions in, um, West German_ to run West Germany, after the war.
Incl_ when West Germany got it's army, back, I think in the mid-nineteen fifties, of course, the core of the army officers were, and had to be, people who'd served in Hitler's armies.
Who else could they be.
And, um, so on.
And for a long time you're, um, you know, Nazis in West German society have always been unmasked.
Former Nazis who'd done something awful.
It's past away now, because, you'd have to be very old.
Ha ha.
To have been active in the Hitler side.
Um, what about former Nazis in East Germany.
Well there were, actually, plenty, running East Germany as well.
But officially there weren't.
Ha ha.
Officially that wasn't true.
It was only the_ West Germany which had Nazis.
Then the Americans and British were given stick, of course, for... Tolerating, or not punishing, um, you know, former German Nazis.
Um, so, in both cases, um, the analogy with totalitarianism, death camps, and dictatorship, which the West made between Soviet Russia, and, um, Nazi Germany, was very powerful.
Um,  the analogy, of capitalism, inequality, and exploitation.
And, also, the age-old wish of the West to invade Russia, and really do for Russia.
Which is what the Soviets, um, the analogy the Soviets made, between, the Nazi regime, and, the western capitalist democracies, um, were very powerful, I think, for both parties."
"The human immuno deficiency, virus, H-I-V has now afflicted the world.
It essentially_ it is believed that it originated in sub-Saharan Africa.
Largely in West Africa Nigeri_ in Northern Nigeria.
The virus is extremely complicated.
It acts upon the human immune system in a specific way.
It attaches to the body's own_ the ce- the bo- uh, the cells in the body, um, that are key to defending the body, from external infection.
These are called T-cells.
The job of T-cells is to look, through the body to find bacterium or viruses, or other foreign agents that could harm the body's physiology.
The responsibility of these T-cells was to target these, internalize these viruses, bacterium or toxins, and destroy them.
The human immuno deficiency virus... Enters the cell_ enters the, uh, body and then, is sighted by the T-cell through specific proteins.
The cell, recognizing the virus as a foreign invader then internalizes the virus, and instead of consuming the virus, is itself destroyed.
This is inherently the, the problem with H-I-V.
Many drugs that are used to vaccinate human beings against the invasion of viruses, use the body's own immune system, as a means of defending them, uh, against these foreign invaders.
If the foreign invader in and off itself destroys the body's main machinery in self-defense, it inherently is a disease that seems_ seemingly is uncurable [incurable] using contemporary techniques for vaccine development.
H-I-V has two main strains.
H-I-V one and H-I-V two.
H-I-V one originated, in, actually, in the central portions of Western Africa.
Mainly north of present day Cote d'Ivoire.
The virus was, a- allegedly brought to North America, um, via a single, um, airline attendant.
Purportedly a single airline attendant, um, who was bisexual.
The_ therefore a lot of the original strains of H-I-V that appeared in Canada, and in the Northern United States in the late nineteen seventies, were mainly spread amongst the homosexual community.
Through inter- through intercourse primarily and, later when_ through the uses of drugs and through the sharing of syringes, mainly in urban areas in United States.
And then spread, um, through the metropolis on the East Coast of the United States, from Boston to Washington D-C and then started to spread, um, westward and then eventually into California.
Where the largest number of AIDS cases actually exists per capita.
H-I-V one is also spread throughout Europe.
Mainly afflicting the Mediterranean countries, Spain and France and Italy.
And to a lesser extent, uh, Germany, England and the Northern European countries.
H-I-V one was misnomered originally the gay AIDS, so to speak, because it was originally spread through bisexual contact, mainly in the West.
H-I-V two is a second, and even deadlier strain that orig- actually originated in Northern Nigeria and Zaire, and has spread, by no means_ one really does not know how it was originally spread.
But has found its largest home in South Asia.
Mainly in India, mainly in former French Indo-China.
Where in Thailand one in twe- one in four Thai prostitutes is actually infected with H-I-V two.
H-I-V two has been misnomered, the heterosexual AIDS because it has primarily been spread through, through heterosexual contacts through prostitution, um, um, and also, um, through drug use.
Which is, is high in the more depressed areas of, of French_ in former French Indo-China, South East Asia, India, and is slowly spreading into China where it could possibly have disaster effe- disastrous effects on the human family.
H-I-V two is more virulent, because one of the main, uh, proteins that the body's immune systems uses to originally fight the first infection, um, of AIDS.
The original virus, the virus enters one's body, there's an original assault on the, um, virus when it enters the body.
It is destroyed to a large extent, within mutates.
And one of its main, uh, main tags it allows the body to identify H-I-V, mutates much more rapidly in the second strain, H-I-V two than H-I-V one.
Making H-I-V two a much hairier problem for those who would design vaccines or devise drugs, um, that destroy it.
A lot of the AIDS effort has focused upon the development of vaccines.
A lot of them have involved taking the genetic information from the virus, and giving the patient just, the virus alone.
These vaccines have been largely been unsuccessful for the reasons I have given originally.
That the virus attacks the body's immune system, using a vaccine to, boost... So to speak the already depleted immune system, seems contrary to logic.
More interesting examples using small chemicals.
Made_ chemicals by the name of A-Z-T, Antaxol, and others have been slightly more successful in stemming, the growth of viruses particularly H-I-V one among Western patients who have received these drugs.
The future, of H-I-V research both one and two,must be pursued from a chemical level.
They must also be pursued with equality.
H-I-V two has largely been ignored, because it afflicts largely third world populations.
The ability for large pharmaceutical companies, the only ones that have the resources to develop these potent new drugs, find no economic benefit, in supplying, very expensive high technology, uh, to third world nations afflicted with the second strain.
The first strain through the political agitation of, groups, be they gay rights groups, um, um, be they left liberal groups in the United States and in Europe, has pushed the drug industry to pay attention, uh, to the AIDS problem.
Eventually, I believe, the AIDS virus can only be conquered through a battery of small chemicals that can, fundamentally destroy the virus' ability to mutate, uh, so rapidly.
Its main weapon of evading the human immune system.
Then, in combination with a well-developed vaccine, can we then destroy, H-I-V and eliminate this scourge from the world."
"Islam and Christendom.
Um, someone's just remarked to me, that they were very surprised that when they were at school, doing the, general history courses, that one has at school.
Um, Islam, hardly figured at all, um, in what he learnt, or was asked to study.
Uh, this was, um, I think in the fifties and sixties, and that was quite common then.
Nowadays, with the multicultural approach, you would certainly learn about Islam, and Islamic civilization.
But, up until fairly recently, you learnt very little.
I think there are several reasons for this.
One is simply, constrictions, um, not enough time.
One starts off with the history of one's own countries.
Considered important to do that.
And what leads up to it.
So, as he said, you might start off with Mesopotamia, and Ancient Egypt.
But after that, by the time you get to, more recent centuries, although you once looked at Ancient Egypt, you don't bother, for example, to look at the seventeenth, or eighteenth century Egypt.
And, I think that was the point he was making.
'Why not.
' Partly, maybe lack of time.
Secondly, um, I think was a sort of, um, imperial assumption that, whatever civilizations, oriental peoples had originally, at some point there was a big, um, pulling ahead.
Like pulling ahead on the motorway, at some time, say in the late seventeenth century.
And we overtook the oriental peoples.
And they subsided into decadence, while we went on to great things.
And in fact ruled them in empires.
And even if we didn't, formally, rule them, they certainly had to do what we said, for a long time.
And in the nineteen sixties, it was still the attitude.
A lot of people couldn't understand Nasser, for example, why he was being so cheeky.
He was looked upon as a rather cheeky junior, President Nasser of Egypt.
Ha ha.
And to some degree, I suppose it's that attitude still lingers vis a vis.
Saddam Hussein.
Um, or the Ayatollah Khomeini in, i- i- Iran.
But, I suggest there's a more profound reason.
In fact, slightly buried in the consciousness, that for both Islam, and Christendom, the other, has been 'The Other', with capital letters.
For, the Muslims, whether Arabs or Turks.
Less so for Persians, they were too far away.
Or Iranians, today.
Um, the, Christen_ Christians, seemed to be the arch rivals.
Um, perhaps, I ought to modify what I said about the Iranians, because if you look at the poisonous rhetoric of the Ayatollahs, against the United States.
Not necessarily, against Chinese, or Japanese Buddhists.
Against the United States, a Christian civilization.
Interesting.
Um... And... We, you_ you know, for both parties that is the alien, or rather different civilisation, which has been encountered, in fact, for about thirteen hundred years.
And for a long time, until the seventeenth century, encountered technologically, and, on equal terms, in fact Islam, for a lot of the middle ages was superior in many parts of life.
In, um, sanitation, architecture, carpets, general luxury standard of living as well.
But, um, the rivalry, um, the military contest is very long lived.
You're start_ you are starting off with the conquest of what's now Spain, in the seventh century.
And the Arab Muslims were not really pushed out, or conquered to fourteen ninety-two of the same year that Columbus went to America.
As for the eastern wing, the Turks over the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean.
Well the Turks, they threatened to role over Austria, and, um, conquer Austria in fifteen twenty-nine.
They were pushed back.
But they hung on to tw_ um, two-thirds of Hungary, til the sixteen eighties.
The sixteen eighties was in fact their last aggressive throw.
They got to Vienna again, or they had no hope of holding it then.
But still, there is this great contest.
Um, paradoxically, um, in fact, Christians and Muslims, are not so different as all that.
Their religions are not, so different.
Um, uh, they share_ bo- both are based on strains from the Jewish religion.
The third great monotheistic, um, monotheistic religion.
They, all accept the Old Testament.
The Muslims accept, um, Jesus as a prophet.
Not as divine.
So, when Muslims, and Christians talk as both talk, there's a certain common dialogue.
Um, it's partly the rivalry of people who're interconnected.
In a way, you might say that Hindus, Chinese, and Japanese.
Their civilisations are even more different.
But, in a way that, made them, for a long time irrelevant.
Or seemingly irrelevant.
Their contribution was very indirect.
Ha ha.
What you can understand_ you can understand a rivalry that's right up against you geo- geographically, in the Mediterranean.
And shares, quite a lot of the same common culture.
Um, although, there are two ways of dealing with that.
If you have a rival.
Um, you know, a deep-rooted rival.
You can either_ the intelligent approach is to get to know about, him or her.
Get to know your enemy, and in the process stop being an enemy.
The other is to_ either to vilify them, and say, 'oh, well nothing good ever comes from the Muslims,' etcetera.
With a result there have been some astonishing preconceptions about the MusliMs  um, in the middle ages, for example, um, lots of Christians believed that the Muslims were idolators.
That they worshipped graven images, sticks and stones.
Um, in fact, that, couldn't be further from the truth.
The Muslims take very seriously the injunctions in the Old Testament, and maybe given by Mohammed himself, that you cannot make any graven image.
You don't see any graven images in Muslim mosques.
You could say that was far truer_ the Muslims, in fact, one of the objections of the Muslims to medieval Catholicism, indeed, to Catholicism today, I imagine.
Is it is full of graven images.
Ha ha.
So it's very odd, that, that was a Christian criticism of MusliMs  it's more just the other way round.
But, even as late as, um, the eighteen nineties when Kipling, um, was trying to imitate a common soldier.
Just at the time that we'd beaten the Sudanese.
Known unflatteringly, as the 'Fuzzy Wuzzies' at the Battle of Ondurman, in eighteen ninety-eight.
He imagines the common British soldier, an ordinary British soldier, giving a tribute to, this, um, brave, if, if, um, misguided enemy.
So he's_ he perpetrates the memorable lines, 'here's to you Fuzzy Wuzzy, at home in the Sudan.
You're a poor beknighted heathen, but you're a first rate fighting man.
'Now of course, Muslims are not heathens at all.
Kipling, himself, would have known that.
But he assumed he was writing in the persona of a very ordinary Brit.
He assumed that, um, an ordinary nineteenth-century Brit in the Christian tradition, would just think that Muslims were heathens.
So, there has been that sort of, um, rivalry, and also, to some degree incomprehension, of Muslim civilisation.
This has been_ um, one has been able to get away with that, um, in spite of the spread of universal education in the West, since the eighteen seventies.
Because, for a lot of the time, we seemed to have won.
You could argue, that the Muslim lands were, genuinely behind.
Genuinely decadent, compared with the West which was forging ahead.
Um, uh, that is an over simplification, obviously, but certainly the technology, of, um, the Muslim countries.
I think the best thing to say, if one, takes it_ very broad analogies.
The Muslims got sort of stuck in the seventeenth century technologically.
Other ways while we, um, managed to get ahead.
Now, um, and also, um, Islam didn't get, and still hasn't got, in large part, uh, the ideas of liberal democracy, coming from John Locke, and others, and the thinkers of the French Revolution, and so on.
And the Enlightenment which we hold dear over here.
Or allegedly hold dear.
Um, what is the situation today.
Um, the fairly unthinking idea that um, Muslims, might be interesting, but not terribly relevant.
Um, because, they're a bit behind us, is going.
There's now much more of an appreciation, of the Muslim contribution, throughout history to, um, civilisation.
Because, of course, a lot of ideas, got in.
The reason why, um, academics in western Europe wear black robes is because the mus_ the mullahs in the Muslim universities of Spain, before one thousand A-D.
In the, uh, first millennium, wore black robes, as mullahs still do.
And they in fact had universities, before the Christian West, further north did.
We pinched the idea from them.
And we also pinched the idea of the black robes from them.
Ha ha.
Um, that's a small example, but there are many others.
Irrigation, all kinds of things.
Um, the_ tha_ that contribution in earlier times of the Muslims is much appreciated.
And, of course, on the other hand, sheer power_ the technological gap is now going down.
I mean it, depends, the Muslim world's big, it depends where you are.
But, obviously, the Gulf states, are, um, really richer than western Europe.
And, uh, in terms of technology, they've gone from, you know, a very pre-industrial technology, to the, technological cutting edge.
At least in terms of what they import.
But, increasingly learning to do, within forty, fifty years.
Um, so, um, awareness of the Muslim world, can only, um, grow, I think in the West.
Particularly, either whether the state is hostile, or whether they're friendly, they are still our neighbours, and they're very important, um, factors in the world.
Partly because of the oil, as economic and political, partners or rivals.
Far more than they were say, seventy years ago, when the Europeans simply decided what would happen to MusliMs  the most notorious thing is the Sykes-Picot Agreement, in the First World War, between the English and French.
Sykes' English, Picot French, to carve up the Arab Provinces of the, um, Ottoman Empire.
So, the Muslim-Turks were being deprived of the Muslim Arabs.
But instead it was Lawrence of Arabia wanted.
The Arabs getting a unitary Middle-Eastern State.
They were carved up into protectorates between England, and France.
And it's actually from that, I think, a lot of the trouble now comes.
You know, from that carving up by, you know, by section.
But, uh, Muslims were then treated as, you know, colonials.
Sort of slightly superior black Afri_ versions of black Africans.
You can't do that nowadays.
Ha.
And you couldn't have done in the seventeenth century.
It's interesting, ha ha, it's the, the needed period."
"Immediately following the Second World War, the leftists that, had comprised, uh, largely the_ had largely comprised the anti-Nazi resistance in Italy, came under attack.
The population of Italy had seen as heroes the partisans and communists, that had attempted, um, to first of all rid Italy of its own internal fascistic, um, forces.
Having, grabbed Mussolini on the border with Switzerland before he could possibly escape.
And presented he and the, uh, the, the body of his mistress to the, to the, screaming crowds of Rome.
Had now become_ suddenly become the enemy.
Although they had been the valiant heroes that had essentially forced Hitler to surrender Italy, as a soft u- underbelly of the axis.
Are now_ ca- came under attack wi- of a new enemy.
And this enemy had nothing to do with Germany.
Immediately after the surrender of Germany in nineteen-forty-five, the United States of America, had essentially, come into agreement with Victor Emmanuel, and some of, some of the Mussolini's own undersecretaries.
That the new government in Rome should essentially be, made into the monarchy.
First under Victoria_ uh, Victor Emmanuel the Second.
And also a representative democracy of sorts.
It left as councilors, largely those, um, fas- fascist sympathizers that es- had been under the government_ had been in the government of Mussolini.
On the other hand, for the most part the popularity of the partisans and the popularity of the Communist Party for the most part, uh, was extremely strong, among the people, o- of Italy.
A number of authors, particularly, a- and most interestingly Noam Chomsky, ha- have actually discussed, the intervention on the part of the United States, government.
And particularly the Central Intelligence Agency.
In maintaining, um, very strong, um, rightist political parties.
That had very little popular standing, with the people of, of then recovering fascist Italy.
Um, and their downright infiltration of_ particularly of the socialist parties_ the center, the center socialist parties, um, the partisans and the workers unions.
Uh, within Italy and the most potent force of all, of course being, the communist party of Italy.
The strongest, um, the strongest in Western Europe.
Um, with the French communists being a, a distant second, to be honest.
It was_ has been revealed under recently declassified information, on the part of, uh, papers di- distributed from George Kenyon's office and from the National Security Council here in the United States.
That it was the intent, um, of the Truman administration to ensure that the partisans and the communists did not, find seats, uh, in the Councils of Rome.
Indeed, it was_ has actually been quoted, um, from some recently declassified National Security Council briefs, that the United States was more than willing to in fact, have, overt military operations in Italy.
That is to actually invade Italy to ensure, that the elections, that immediately followed the restoration of Victor Emmanuel, and the restoration of the, of a quote se_ purportedly non-fascistic government to Italy, would go, quote in the right direction.
The Italian communi- communists have actually, uh, published a, a book that is now available in our local Princeton University bookstore.
That details the infiltration, um, of central intelligence agencies, American central intelligent agents, um, into, um, the partisan and the communist parties.
Regardless_ despite the fact that the United States was willing to intervene, um, were the communists, uh, to secure victory.
In this_ the f- following, in the elections immediately following V-E day.
What actually ended up happening was that center socialist, movements, um, some of th- the parties had actually broken with the Trotskyites, um, within the Italian communist party.
Formed a center social party that it took_ ended up carrying the day.
Um, their_ the history of these elections though, is, is quite up in the air.
And one does not really know to what extent the internal divisions among the trade unionist, parties and the communist parties in Italy led to this, disaster essentially for the far left.
Um, and how much, the foreign intervention, particularly on the part of the United States actually paid a role, in moving the, post-Fascist Italian government, um, more to the center.
But regardless_ even as the, uh, communist movement in Italy has moved farther from being bright red to, more, shall we say, a very bright pink.
We can still say that the communist party, in Italy has still maintained its control.
The largely extreme leftist, um, Stalinist apolo_ apolgists within the Italian communist party have fallen away.
For the most part the partisans have been been marginalized in the, in the economy.
And now those, um, portions of the unionist party, that had been the organ for the partisan_ for partisan political involvement in Rome_ in the politics of Rome.
Have essentially been subsumed under, the, the new communist party.
Which is essentially not connected with the Soviet movement at all.
And is really not even, um, has not taken part in any of the, the more Leninist, uh, tendencies, um, of the Italian communists.
Instead they have found their patr- patron saint in Antonio Gramsci, who then was considered, probably the, the best and most creative Marxist of, of any of the, of the continental philosophers.
And Gramsci's, um, ideas with regard to hegemony and with regard to the actual role of the state, um, in determining equality of opportunity, equality of outcome.
And even in terms of their ability to minister to the morals and to the culture of the Italian people, and maintain that which is distinctive of the Italian people, have come under the much more broad and shall we say the much less left communist party that now exists, and [throat clear] is responsible for the current downfall of Romani Prodi’s um, olive branch government, uh, in Rome and the ascension of Mossimo deLima and the socialist communist, um, coalition government that now sits in Rome.
One may say that despite, surprisingly_ despite extremely strong and even potential military intervention on the part of the more rightist governments.
Particularly the extreme right wing governments of the United States, that is in compared to the leftist governments of Italy.
Despite the very potent and very real possibility o- of American intervention.
The Italian communists have maintained their integrity and maintained their strength and, shall we shall say for the Italian people have maintained prosperity, and maintained, um, happiness to the extent that it is possible."
"Well.
I am, um, a political science, uh, P-H-D student at Princeton University.
And, um, I am interested mainly in comparative politics.
Which is one of the four sub-fields of, uh, the_ the discipline.
Um... As an undergraduate i, I did a lot of work in, in both international relations and comparative politics.
So my interests, uh, lie somewhere at the intersection of both.
I should also say that, um, the other main_ two sub-fields of the discipline are American politics and political theory.
Um, specifically, um, what interests me in comparative politics is the, uh, interplay of, um, security, issues, and economic issues.
That is, um, i, I study how, uh, conflicts are structured in a particular way.
Um, and, and how, um, those conflict structures, uh, pay off.
And... I- in the social sciences the payoff is usually mea- measured in economic terMs uh, so, um, what a better example of, of a conflict, than the cold war.
That's how_ that, that was, uh, my main focus as an undergraduate.
And, um, um, the two areas where the cold war was, uh, most contested.
Were Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe also includes, in this case the former Soviet Union, and North East Asia.
And um, those are my main areas of interest.
Uh, um, not so much, uh, Latin America or, or Africa, or other parts of the world.
But primarily, um, the former Communist countries.
And, uh, the countries of North East Asia, Japan, China, Korea.
Um, and in these countries what we see is, um, tha- that it's different from the rest of the world, e- are very strong states, very strong governments, that have used their power, uh, in a number of different ways.
Um, either to accomplish goals externally or, internally in, in their own societies, in their own countries.
Um.
And for me it is very interesting to, um, to study, um, their motivations and, and th- the, the resources and, the nature and, and the, the way they have used those powers.
Um, and, uh, this is something that is, um, a little bit like I said.
It's a little bit, um, uh, of an oddity in, um, in the world.
Because most, most, most uh, countries of the world are characterized by weak governments, weak states.
Not strong states.
Strong states are somew- somewhat an exception.
And, um, of course the fact that the countries that I study, um, exhibit strong states, uh, is probably an indication of, of the fact that they lie in very conflictual, uh, situations.
Uh, either from within or from without, or both.
But it_ it doesn't take away the fact that it_ it is somewhat a_ something of an oddity, um, both in time and space.
Um, both compared to the rest of the world right now.
But also, um, uh, through, through history.
And, the end of the cold war is definitely something_ somewhat of an epoc- epoch making event, you know.
It will_ it has changed and, it will changed things, uh, substantially, like, uh, some other events, um, before, um, and, uh, it, it gi-gives... This whole, uh, topic, um, a new flavor.
It makes it even more interesting.
Um, now that, uh, so much of what we knew, uh, grew up with has_ is gone.
And, uh, we're sort of in a state of flux right now.
Yeah.
And um, yeah that's, uh, that's pretty much a summary of, uh, my interests "
"The great apologists for the Anglo-American economies, especially those of preeminent economists such as Milton Freedman and Paul Krugman, and an assortment of others of their ilk have attempted to create a new national, or shall we say world myth, regarding the nature of capitalism.
Their patron saints of course, a litany that is probably very familiar, uh, to the listener and they include Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, um, and now a closer, uh, to our hearts, um, such, such great thinkers as Kenneth Arrow, uh, Paul Samuelson, Gary Becker, and of course, John Maynard Keynes.
The concept of capitalism is_ has been sold to the people of the world, and particularly the people of the Anglo-Saxon world, as being rather simple.
We have a lot of individual players, um, individuals have, tried to maximize their freedom by playing the market, and the market is of course the great arbiter.
And the, the great propagandists have done well in expurgating Smith.
They have taken selective chunks from his arguments, they have done a great job in expurgating Keynes, and essentially taking um, those tidbits, which seemed to support their ideas of, of libertarian freedoms, um, for the benefit of maximizing wealth.
Unfortunately, really existing capitalism, is, is much, um, a part of the great smoke screen.
As, as much, um, part of the sort of Chinese room methodology, uh, as any of the_ any of the propaganda that has been given to the West with regard to Communism.
It seems as though a lot of our illustrious propagandists be they Krugman, be they Becker, be they Freedman, um, have attempted to take Smith and use his name, take Keynes use his name, and have not told us what they really said.
The capitalist myth.
. .  Is one that dominates, the lives of, probably in excess of fifty to maybe seventy-five per cent of the world's population.
And the world's population must know, that American style capitalism which is now s- slowly, like a disease, like a plague so to speak, um, accommodating, um, the world, the world's economies, um must be revealed for what it really is.
It is no more than another form of state capitalism, and I would like to define my terMs free market capitalism of course, is the religion of the day.
Especially within the United States and probably what, we can be safe to say, is the religion of the English-speaking world.
Free market capitalism believes in the infinite capacity of the market to absorb goods.
And the absolute infinite capacity for individuals to play a part in that market.
The idea is that... Government.
For all intents and purposes should maintain the integrity of contracts, should of course, uh, attend to law and order, and should not play a great role in economics as much as is possible.
Unfortunately, that is very, very far from the truth.
The vast majority of players in the world economy.
In fact sixty-seven percent of the economy of the United States is dominated, not by individuals, but by conglomerates.
In other words, um, cooperative organizations that orbit around the whim of stockholders.
They are otherwise known as corporations.
Corporations do not fit in the great scheme, the great anti-mercantilist scheme of Smith.
If anyone has read, um, cap_ ,um, the Wealth of Nations one realizes that.
The government indeed plays a great role.
And when Eisenhower left office...- In the nineteen-fifties he honestly w- uh, warned the American people, that a military industrial complex would raise its head.
This is obviously just theological, progression of capitalism, the idea is, as you consolidate capital it becomes more and more necessary for the government, of course, to regulate the whims of the market.
Fewer players mean that the market is subject to greater and greater fluctuations.
A greater tendency to fall into recession and depression.
So, what we find is that the government has attempted to do, away with a lot of the, great market forces that Smith describes.
The idea is that more and more of yo_ the American taxpayer money, and more and more of the capital capacity of the United States is put into the hands of corporations.
Through indirect means, or through means that have been kept from the immediate sight of the American public and the world in general.
The idea of a defense budget, which has been as high as four hundred billion dollars a year, has given the Americans a great sense of security.
The belief that all of that money is essentially put into the hands of defense contractors for the defense, of our beloved homeland from all of those, uh, evil demons that seek to, um, to rape and pillage on the_ from the purse of the United States.
What is indeed the truth is that the vast majority of this are used as means of propping up, um, large high tech industries that really can't compete.
Due to inefficiency, due to dead weight loss and other.
Uh.
Negative externalities within the market.
For example, the United States semiconductor industry collapsed in the nineteen- eighties primarily due to, due to competition from their counterparts in Japan.
The result has been, an_ in excess of one hundred billion dollars’ worth of American taxpayer money, in the development of two corporations.
First United Memories and second Sematech as an attempt to get the United States back into the high end of the semiconductor market.
This does not obey, free market capitalism.
In fact, um, some very good sources including Steve Brower and Noam Chomsky, have pointed out, that were it not for, uh, taxpayer intervention the vast majority of American businesses that are part of the world’s Fortune Five Hundred probably would not be in existence today.
Um, the Europeans are very much more open, in terms of their use of, of social, uh, control over industries including cooperatives, and including airbus industries and others, that are quite famous.
The Americans therefore must be addressed in specific.
If indeed we are a free market capitalist society, we have absolute freedom, we have liberties, of individuals participating in the market.
Then why is it necessary, that corporations should subsume greater and greater, um, greater and greater, um, parts of the, uh, gross domestic product of this country.
Why is it that we should reduce, uh, the discretionary income of Americans, and lower their wages in favor of giving, more and more money, um, to the otherwise inefficient capacities of our corporations.
This doesn't seem to make very much sense if one is actually_ believes, um, in Smithian, uh, capitalism.
On the other hand, it seems as though the free market capitalists have misread Keynes.
It is very odd, that, this_ he the most influential economists probably of the late twentieth century.
Seems to have been grossly misread as being a Ricardian capitalist when he is quite the opposite.
If one remembers that the new deal was based on, uh, Keynesianist ideas.
The idea of the government’s responsibility to pump prime the economy.
One realizes that this cannot possibly jive with the free market capitalist propaganda that is given to us by, such luminaries as Krugman and Becker.
In the most influential book of right wing capitalist thought probably written since the end of the Second World War, is Milton Freedman's famous ""Capitalism and fre- and Freedom.""  Capitalism and freedom have often been linked within the American psyche.
That one is, is necessary for the other.
Any alternative to capitalism obviously impinges upon the freedom, uh, of, of the, the body politic so to speak.
Um, the idea behind capitalism and freedom is just simply this.
One must eliminate government’s constraints on individual choice on public choice, such that, a cap_ in a capitalist economy in and of itself maximizes public choice.
And government should stay out of the pot.
Therefore, this is just yet another defense of libertarian right wing capitalism.
But the fact is had the government stayed out of industry.
It is likely that the United States would fall further behind in the industries in which it has already ceded, um, preeminence to the Japanese and to the Western Europeans.
The United States ceded its dominance in steel, mainly to the Japanese, and for a brief period of time in the nineteen- eighties to England.
Further they have, uh, ceded their preeminence in chemicals and machine tools to the Germans.
And have ceded their, uh, dom- by slowly ceding their dominance in aerospace, um, to a United Europe.
Um, what is more, consumer electronics of course have been put in the hands of the Japanese and the Koreans, and this has, um, been quite well publicized, uh, in the United States.
The United States government has been incredibly responsible for propping up, ou- our corporations and propping up our gross domestic product.
Um, by_ through the use of public debt and through the use of tax payers money.
These are facts, and these are essentially the, tenants of American state capitalism without which we could not have the purportedly successful economy that we have.
Let us shine the real light, on really existing capitalism as we have shown light on the real existing, socialism, around the world, and let us eliminate the capitalist. . .      "
"After the rhythmic, um, complications and, and, um, um... Very hard, um... Very ha_ very hard, very hard divisions o- o- of the basic rhythmic unity.
Which, took place in the la_ in the later part of the fourteenth century.
The beginning of the fifteenth century sees a simplification of, musical practice.
Where, um, even if it, it kept with, um, it kept up with, um,  mm, polyphonic structure.
E_ sometimes quite complex.
Nevertheless it, it gave up all these rhythmic complications which, which was sort of experimenting new, uh, mesural practices, in the beg_ at the_ in the end of the fourteenth century which be_ which now_ and they had more to experiment_ so it hopped back to a more simple, uh, musical, uh, um, uh, sound.
The main composers of this_ uh, of this, um, of the fifteenth century are_ beginning of the fifteenth century, at least, are uh, Dufay and Binchois.
Guillaume Dufay and Binchois.
Who are, um, who are both of, um, Franco-Flemish provenance.
Dufay worked in, uh, basically, he spen_ spent his early years in Italy.
Although he was of Cambrai, no- which is no- now that's northern France.
And, uh, he spent, uh, his, uh, his, um, his, um, formative years.
But then, he, he worked very much for the, um, uh, well for, for the S- Savoy House.
For the Malatesta, and for the Pope as well.
Then he went back to, to his homeland.
To, to the Flanders.
Af- after having acquired lots of ecclesiastical benefices, where he could survive with.
In fact you don't have to forget, that most of the musicians of this era were ecclesiastical.
We- were clerics.
And, uh, just because, um, uh, educated musicians could acquire the education, attending a capitular and cathedral schools.
And, uh, many of these then t- took on th- the orders.
Just because uh_ just because it was a very suitable way to, uh, to, to have an income without, um, uh, the insecurity of an employment by patrons.
Which was not always, uh, uh, a guarantee of course.
And so they had to_ they had to cope with it.
And they_ most of them become_ became clerics and tried to ac_ tried to acquire a_ as, as, as much benefices_ as many benefices as eccles_ ecclesiastical benefices, and (xx) as possible.
So that when they were old, and possibly not any more_ un- unable to, to work.
To be employed as, um, as choir directors and, and teachers.
They could survive on this.
And many mu- many musicians made a fortune of this.
In fact we fi_ at the end of his, of his, um, life, i- in the fourteen seventies, was a rich man.
And, uh, um, and he was, was very successful.
Of course not, not all musicians were so lucky.
But at least they were able to become [cough] to lead a decent life with this.
And, um, according to, to how many, uh, to how many, um... Renowned patrons that contracted you in a lifetime.
And, ho- how powerful these patrons were the, uh, uh, proportionate to this, they had as many benefices, and so they could survive with this.
Binchois is another case.
Because Guillaume [should be Gilles] Binchois was a, a_ was a layman, he was not_ is not a cleric.
And in fact, he_ perhaps he was not even an educated musician.
Uh, because wh_ i_ because even if we had, uh, lots of music come_ uh, handed down from him.
From_ by, by him.
It doesn't_ that does not mean that he, he personally wrote this music.
Because i- it can also mean that it just, uh, uh_ he just had it, uh, um, written down by scribes.
But th- b- i_ i_ i_ I suppose then, other people supposed that he was not a musical_ musical_ musical literate.
Because, uh, because he was not a cleric.
And the, the way of acquiring_ because he w_ he had not had, uh, an ecclesiastical education.
The only way of acquiring musical_ a musical written education was through a church.
At that epoch.
At that age.
And in fact he was employed as a court musician, by the Dukes of Burgundy.
Who employed him as, um_ was classed as a minstrel.
Minstrel al_ all of those musicians who were not employed as chap_ chap_ chaplain masters, as maestro di capella, maestro di capella are the capellmeisters.
And, um, uh, and so, uh, he was_ he was, uh, well he made his life entertaining the Dukes of Burgundy, basically.
As a_ but, um, usually these musicia_ but the- these_ it's an exception that we have so much music handed down from him.
Because they usually_ these music_ musicians being not literate, had not the music handing down.
Had not the music written down.
So_ because they used to improvise perhaps.
So they used sing on their_ on the lute, or, or on other st_ string instruments.
Or plu_ or plucked instruments.
At the end of the four_ fifteenth century, um... The, mm... We_ this is_ this a sort of, um, extreme specialisation of, um, um, sacred and secular music to_ within polyphony.
And, uh, the, the complexity grows again, uh, very, very, um, very hard.
As it was with the end of the fourteenth century, as I mentioned before.
And for example, we have the development of a very complex musical structure.
Such as_ such as the Mass, where each movement has it's own, uh, structure and was_ and it was u_ unified by a, a song, which could come either from, uh, a, um... Sacred environment.
From Chant or either fro- from, from secular music.
But which was utilised.
Which was used, for building up the whole structure.
Either by imitation of it.
Or either by, uh, by simply adding o- other voices upon it, uh, and according to, to the harmonic rules.
So there was ve_ very complex things.
Which can be compared, actually, to symphonies.
Except that, they ha_ they had, um_ unlike symphonies this music had to be performed during a very, very definite, uh, uh, social and, uh, and, uh, um, religious events.
So they were, they were functional music in, in a way.
There was functional music.
And in fact music was, was functional un_ until the development of classical music.
Because it was, uh, conceived for certain events.
And it could not be_ it was not thought of as capable of, of conveying meaning outside, outside these things.
Uh, but apart from these written traditions in the fifteenth century.
We have a, we have a so_ sort of under, um, um, undercurrent, uh, sort of lower music making, which was not written down, but which is very important.
Because perhaps it was fo_ it formed a bulk of musical activities of the e- e- of the era.
Which shows again the music_ the written music making was not, uh, even if wa_ if there was most educated one, it was not the prevailing.
It wasn't the prevailing one.
And it tended to be quite, uh, um, a specialised one."
"Probably the most important, uh, biological question especially for mammals, or more complex organisms, is the question of sex.
Why do we have sexual dimorphism to begin with.
And to understand, um, basically, the evolution of sex one must understand the evolution of organisms in general.
Um, the first freestanding organisms that evolved from the coacervates, the, the very basic, uh, assortments of, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and fatty acids that existed were, were the essential precursors to single celled organisMs  single celled organisms, um, didn't require a lot of energy in order to deal with their environment.
They were very simple bundles of chemicals for all intents and purposes.
They needed maybe a carbon source.
Maybe exposure to sunlight, um, of course water and for the most part they were happy doing their own thing.
Simple celled organisms for the most part reproduced, asexually, that is they would replicate their D-N-A.
They would actually generate additional copies of whatever structural proteins they needed.
And then they would just simply divide and form two organisms where there had b- before only been one.
One may ask, well if single cell organisms, our ancestors so to speak, found it very easy to get along without having two sexes.
Then why is it that we develop sex.
Well a very common argument on the part of ecologists, on the part of geneticists is this, even though there is a great a la_ a great amount of efficiency in terms of energy used by, uh, single sex or shall we say asexual organisMs  at the same time there isn't a heck of a lot in terms of genetic diversity.
Mutations, um, that accumulate over thousands of years start to accumulate, uh, within the genetic information of single celled organisms, and without the ability to mix with another organism... This is_ find some means by which the, the two can exchange genetic information.
Such that you have a synergy of sorts, um, between rather a in_ a genetic or an organism that has a, b, and c genetic mutations.
And another organism that has d, e, and f genetic mutations, could possibly create an offspring that is relatively mutation free.
Um, so as we see, with single cell organisms we move up to yeast and, uh, bacteria.
They are the rudimentary, um, structures for sex.
You will find in some species of bacteria, um, what are called, uh,  [Pillai].
These are structures, um, that allow bacteria to conjugate, that is, um, couple with a neighboring bacterium in exchange for genetic information.
This allows, um, for such, uh, awful things I guess in the view of human beings as the transference of antibiotic resistance fo- for example.
What it involves is a, ""male, uh, uh, bacterium, or that bacterium that has a pillus, to exchange genetic information with a unsuspecting neighboring bacterium that lacks a pillus.""  and allow for the mutual exchange of genetic data.
This has allowed given species of bacterium to flourish, um, in the presence, um, of neighbor of thriving neighbors.
The same also goes for yeast.
So the question is there, there must be something within evolution that says, the energy that it takes to sustain two sexed, uh, organisms, um, is worth, uh, I mean the excess energy, is worth being able to clean up your genetic information so to speak.
That is add variation.
That gets rid of mutations that occur due to the environment.
There are toxins within the environment, um, be they electromagnetic, be they chemical etc that will cause mutations.
And there must be a way, um, that nature allows species to first speciate that is differentiate one from the other.
And at the same time perce_ protect themselves from horrible diseases that come with genetic mutations.
So, as animals evolved, so did the structures that allowed for, uh, genetic variation.
That is genetic exchange.
And so by the time we got to more intelligent, uh, animals as we moved up into the more, um, sophisticated file of_ within the animal kingdom, so the structures of sex became,, um more complicated.
One can look at, um, the crustaceans.
One can look at, um, insecta and see that the sexual organs are still very very primitive.
And for the most part are not highly regulated by the central nervous system.
They essentially, uh,  constantly produced germ cells etc.
Um, whereas as you get to more complicated organisms_ even moving into aves and moving into mammalia of course.
One sees, um, genetic organs or sexual organs that are highly controlled, um, by the para- parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systeMs  um, and by the central nervous system in general.
So now we move into the question of, ""okay we have two sexes.""  and why do the sexes behave the way they do.
Why is it that, um, for the most part males, and with, with few exceptions I mean there are exceptions to the_ to almost every rule in biology.
But for the most part males in every species, and particularly mammalia.
Um, seek to maximize their genetic advantage by mating with as many females as possible.
And this applies to, males across the board.
Why is it they seek to couple with as many females as possible.
Whereas for the most part females, um, tend to be extremely selective in terms of mate.
Why shouldn't the female at the same time try to maximize her advantage by mating with as many males as possible.
So the question then comes of, natural selection.
The idea is that both partners seek to find a sexual partner that will maximize their genetic potential.
That the offspring will take all of the most advantageous traits of both parents, and, and use them.
Um, one may say well in that case, it, it should imply that if one has an even distribution of all of the members of the species, then every member of one sex should want to couple with as many members of the opposite sex as is possible.
And therefore would have a greater probability of generating offspring, that have all of the best genes within the species.
But this doesn't happen.
For the most part, um, women_ or females shall we say, um, tend to have a single partner within a given breeding season.
And generate a single offspring.
Or at least a single litter of offspring.
And this is pretty much uniformly the case.
Whereas males, um, have multiple_ are guaranteed if they are successful males within the given group, or given niche, um, in the ecosystem tend to maximize the number of females that they are with.
The philosophy is merely this.
A man's biology governs that their germ cells, sperm for the most part, within the mammalia, um, are very small.
And actually require very much less of the body's physiological energy to produce them.
They are produced for the lifetime of the male.
And for the most part, um, are... The_ are they are easily produced and easily gotten rid of.
And that is, that is probably the intention.
The intention therefore is also, yes a male has an abundant source of energy, he doesn't invest a lot of his energy into his germ cells.
And once he is actually coupled with a female he has no other, further biological, um, burden so to speak, in the actual reproductive process.
The egg cell is many thousand times the size of sperm.
And most mammalian females.
That is of all of the species of mammalia, um, have all of their eggs, um, from the time of birth.
That is females to not produce eggs de novo, once they are born.
So first of all these number of eggs are limited on the part of all mammalian females.
And since the egg is of enormous size, it also requires a lot of energy to, actually invest in all the nutrients that come into an egg, aside from the genetic information.
The female also has the opportunity cost, loss of when she is impregnated she cannot, mate with any others to maximize her gene- genetic potential.
Therefore she has the load of excessive energy being involved in a very large cell.
A limited number of cells, and then at the same time pregnancy.
Which obviously takes you out of other possible interactions during any given breeding season.
So the female thus realizes that her ability to maximize her genetic potential, is limited to one shot per breeding season.
Therefore she must be extremely selective in the mate that she chooses for that given breeding season.
Or, in more monogamous relationships, um, mammalians that tend to be monogamous, um, or among aves or or birds for the most part_ which tend to have monogamous relationships_ or those_ whereas they tend to have monogamous relationship.
Um, the question of energy expenditure and the investment in young is extremely important in in aves.
And in_ among mammallia of course there is also a lot of time, devoted to raising young that have a long gestation period.
That is a long time in the womb.
But at the same time a long caregiving period.
And this is usually put in the hands of females.
Females that are caring for young or are in the middle of gestation can't, therefore produce other young.
  whereas males on the other hand have absolutely no obligation.
Less, energy expenditure a greater and almost seemly inexhaustible number of germ cells.
Um,  therefore can find their best advantage in, shall we say being promiscuous.
So the biological, reasons behind sex, um, point to first, um, the need for genetic variation.
And the need to have two sexes to just protect, uh, the integrity of the genetic information within a given species.
And then once that species has differentiated into a very complex sexual organs and complex sexual behaviors.
That the two sexes run in opposition to each other.
That is it makes sense that, um, i= in excess genetic variation excess, um, mixing shall we say is also disadvantageous.
Um, merely because the the very – the chemical events that allow for, um, mixing of D-N-A so to speak, um, have a limit.
There is a advanta_ there is a limit of a- advantage wherein too much mixing is as deleterious, um, as having an external mutagen or exter- external cause for mutation.
Um, whereas too little is also, uh, a great disadvantage.
So one means of creating a happy medium, is to have one party in the genetic variative scheme be... Uh, particularly the most mobile variable and the other one to be more stable variable.
And in that case the female has tended to be the stable.
And the male to be shall we say, the- the more variable of the two of them.
Therefore we can see that with the different_ differentiation organs and the differentiation of sexual behavior.
Um, the sex, um, as it is seen in the world of nature has a biological basis that, goes a lot_ a long way to explaining, um, the behaviors of all animals, including men."
"The fundamental question of democracy probably lies in determining, how it is that the fo_ that people within a given society, give their consent, to be governed.
This question has been, essentially a, a key issue in political theory, since the time of Aristotle.
The question then becomes how do, men organize themselves within a society and how do they give themselves to a subsection of their society.
How do they give themselves to be governed.
How do they have their economic and political concerns governed over by people who do not necessarily share their same, uh, interests and their selv_ in themselves, or their own self-interest.
Voluntarism, for a long time, um, was essentially the key component of Hobbesian, or, the social contract theory of Thomas Hobbes.
The idea was that, people entered into society as a means of maintaining property, or the acquisition of property.
And the maintenance of their lives.
A life free from violence.
Purportedly in pre_ uh, pre-organized, uh, or shall we say in the times in which men were free of societies.
Were free of obligation one, one from the other.
Um, the a_ the ability to acquire property was simply bate_ um, based on brute strength.
If I had issue with your, having property next to mine.
Or, I wanted your property I could kill you.
And take it from you.
Um, this sort of arrangement obviously is not, very conducive to civilization the, um, progress of technology and, uh, economic development.
Voluntarism, on the other hand, was the idea that men, willfully and freely entered in, uh, to society.
Though, mind you, the very beginning of social contract theory, there was never any concession as to equality.
Therefore, one entered into society as a means of protecting one's person, and protecting one's property.
These are the ideas of, shall we say the more conservative voluntarist idi_ concepturals [conceptions], of social contract theory.more libertarian versions, put forth by Robert Nozick, and other contemporaries, have claimed that, other's have entered_ or that men have really entered into, uh, societies for the purposes, of, protecting person and acquiring property.
Private property has to be, uh, the foundation of any, social contract.
Or the foundation of any civilization, in which the people give their will, or give their consent, uh, to be governed.
Hence, the sole purpose of government therefore is the protection of, of private property.
And of course, the means by which it is acquired.
That is the, uh, keeping, people free, um, from fraud and also maintaining, um, the integrity of contracts.
Others on the other hand have, developed a more liberal version, of social contract theory.
Particularly the line of development from Jorge Heuzo to John Rawls.
This concept, of social, uh, social contract, or social contractarianism is the idea that others have entered in society for the purposes of, giving, of giving equality.
That is, giving private property from the states of nature, and then having, equality of opportunity, and or, depending upon the political vote of the time, equality of outcome.
This idea_ thus expounded by Rawls, is simply this.
Given a group of human beings, under what he terms the ""veil of ignorance,"" they have no knowledge of their gender.
No knowledge of their race.
No knowledge of their standing within civil society.
And, no inherent self-interests that would necessarily, bias them, towards either large accumulations of private capital, or large_ very_ equivalent distributions of private capital, allow them to enter upon agreements, as to how they shall be governed.
In this veil of ignorance Rawls shows, through, ""social choice"" theory, or, gain theory that, for the large_ for a greater extent, people would logically choose, as their form of government, a form of welfare and liberalism.
The idea that human beings would establish a government that allows for, equality of opportunity and or, equality of outcome, within a system wherein private property is, regulated, uh, through democratic means.
By democratic, he does no specify whether, he is pure_ a pure democratic means, or a representative, uh, democratic means, or a form of federalism, of one sort or another.
The aspect is merely this.
As a, principle of entering upon the social contract, of individuals within the given society, must be, assured, that they will always have equality of opportunity and that, the government that they choose, will inherently always give them, rights, um, as according to their ability to, play on the field of, of equality, of opportunity and or outcome.
[Cough]this has essentially led the voluntarism debate astray.
And has, essentially moved conservative social contract theory into the domain of debating the, extent to which, governments, or governments of the_ uh, governments that have been given consent o_ by individuals within society, are allowed to play the_ or bias the game, of the acquisition and exchange of private property.
The more and more libertarian, and more and more, uh, conservative view is, with regard to social, contract theory_ want less and less, um, of a, construction of government that is, all told, a conservative libertarian version, pushes social contract theory back, to its pre-Hobbesian roots.
It is more interested in, maintaining a minimal government that maintains nearly the state of nature.
I will, enter a contract with you, to p_ have my property protected, and or acquire your property.
But I also am_ resolve to use other means by which to do that.
I would prefer to have my minimalist government, look at my, property rights and defend my contracts.
But, if all else fails I can always dissolve the government, if the government is not willing to do as I bid it and, uh, resort to the state of nature.
Use force, if I have force as my means.
[Cough]the listener may realize, that this rule by force, so to speak, therefore presumes that only the weak, within society will want to maintain government.
That is he who is strong, he who has the most guns, or weapons, or, other, shall we say, in a pre-industrial society, the largest club, or the largest means of exercising brute force over his neighbor, for the acquisition of property_ will be, less and less in favor, of a government that protects its contracts, if he believes that his contract's going to be null and void in the state of nature.
And he can acquire more property.
Therefore, conservatists have pushed, the envelope, so to speak, of contract theory to the edge, to its logical conclusion.
Government sole purpose is to, allow for the_ allow for competition.
Whatever that competition is.
And that contracts are merely_ mere formality.
Social contract theory therefore, stands at the most extreme versions, um, of right-wing theory with regard to democracy.
Democracy is there_ uh, you_ one can imagine as the listener might believe, uh, democracy's, um, come about, with those who are_ who give their will to the government.
Want to maintain equalities about common opportunity.
And want the government to have more extensive issue in their lives, other than protection of contracts_ is unnecessary, for a government to inherently be democratic if its sole purpose, is to protect those who wish to acquire property or exchange property from fraud, and from lack of integrity with contracts.
With the lack of a contract's fulfillment.
On the liberal side, many have seen, um, John Rawls, uh, protection of the ideas of the ""veil of ignorance,"" and therefore the equality of outcome and opportunity, as a defense of liberal democracy.
And, many though, have criticized him as not going far enough.
Is the veil_ how deep is the ""veil of ignorance.""  is the vei_ ""veil of ignorance,"" really responsible.
Is it true, that men can enter in a society without knowledge of, gender, of race, or inherent inequalities of talent.
All of these things are part of the Rawlsian system.
One believes that, as social contract theory develops and moves, further to the left from Rawls, one will realize that a movement towards a more democratic socialist version of social contract theory, that is, exclusive formations of co_ governments_ consented governments, or consensual governments, rather, that will focus upon equalities of outcome.
Less equalities of opportunity, is considered more con_ on the more conservative side of, liberal contract theory, or post-enlightenment contract theory, instead the more liberal view, um, takes it_ or shall we say the more socialist view takes it that equality of outcome in the abs_ in_ within the ""veil of ignorance,"" not knowing ones gender, or, in, in truth, the practice of the ""veil of ignorance,"" making it such that equality of outcome, um, is now partitioned as according to, race and gender and brute strength shall we say.
And as we move further away, haha, from the right-wing, perspective.
Such is the development of so_ social contract theory largely divided between two camps.
The main camp, and the camp that has essentially followed Rawls, it has, has found its foundation is what is cosol_ it's considered an excess of democracy.
That is, is important to use the Rawlsian social concept, developed.
Originally having its foundations in Russo, around the concepts of popular democracy.
A true popular democracy, where in representative democracy has less of the shielding that it has in actual practice.
And, uh, shall we say, in real practicing state capitalist, um, movements that claim to be social contractual.
These democracies, um, would on the other hand, constantly ensure that not only the weak, who have consented to being governed.
But even those that believe that they have great advantages, were they put in the state of nature, will also be satisfied, in that they will have equal voice.
And, if they indeed do have equality of outcome, within the system, they will, stand to benefit yet more from a full participation within, a democratic social contractual scheme.
On the other hand, the right-wing, um, version.
Or shall we say the more conservative forms of voluntarism, of shall we say, post-Kantiant or post_ those ideas that followed Emmanuel Kant.
Those ideas of minimalist, or shall we say, um, a minimalist government was_ with the least democracy favors only the strong.
Such that there are no_ there stand to be no benefits for the weak and the strong as there are in the left version.
But only for those, who are willing no only to enforce their contracts within a minimalist state, but then, to use force in the state of nature, to backup a government they find is further_ too weak, or too intrusive to their aiMs  these ideas of social contract theory, though based all the way back to Greek thought, have now, um, found a renaissance, particularly with the writings of Rawls and Nozick, after having fallen out of favor with the rise of utilitarianism.
Social contract theory right now stands at the very crux of arguments around the world.
Not only the English speaking um.
Arguments that find, as their point, a varied justification of democracy in the world."
"The Battle of Culloden, seventeen forty-six.
Um, this defeat was inevitable.
The Highland Jacobite army, had lost already, before, the battle started.
They were hungry, ill-supplied, and ill-led.
Um, they'd lost in a deeper sense.
The previous year, this army had got as far as Derby, in England.
And the leader and pretender, Prince Charles, Bonnie Prince Charlie, had wanted to push onto London, until dissuaded by the clan chiefs, who formed his officer corps.
Thereby, they belied their rash reputation.
In fact, a push to London, um, might have succeeded.
Um, the Hanovarian Home Defense Forces, were tiny, and badly organised.
The main British Army being on the continent, fighting France and Prussia.
And even the king.
The Hanovarian King, George II, was out of the country.
He was the last English king actually, to lead his armies in battle.
If the half-Jacobite gentry of lowland Scotland, Wales, and England, did not, did not rise up for Prince Charles, as the Highlanders had done.
Equally, they were not rallying to George II of Hanover, either.
A point, often overlooked.
Much of the country was in solid neutrality, waiting to see which way the cat would jump.
So, if the Highland Army, had pressed on, from Derby to London, in seventeen forty-five, there's just a chance, that there could have been a Jacobite restoration.
But it was not to be.
The chance was missed.
Uh, by turning north, turning back at Derby, the army lost momentum, and the intervening year, between then, and Culloden, had been one long, slow, depressing retreat through England back up to Scotland.
To their heartland in the Highlands.
Until they could go no further.
Culloden is near Inverness.
Inverness is in the north-east tip of Scotland.
Note, I said the Jacobite Highland Army.
There is nothing inevitable about, this coupling of adjectives.
The Jacobites, have many alleged supporters all over Britain.
See what I have said above, or hear what I have said above.
While the Highland clans, had been historically, agin' the Government.
Any Government.
And no particular friends to the Stuarts, on the whole, in the days of Stuart prosperity.
But in f- forty-five, they took their opportunity to be agin' the Hanovarian Government.
And this proved a disastrous last Highland fling, if you'll excuse the pun.
So I think more significant, than the final extinction, or the destruction of Jacobitism at Culloden.
Which have been just a substitute of one royal family for another.
Is the virtual destruction which ensued of a whole society and culture.
The Gaelic highlands.
This followed with a state terrorism and repression, instituted, by, the Hanovarians.
And later developments, like the clearances of the Highlands, where people were, kicked out.
Often by their own, uh, clan chiefs, in favour of sheep.
That came later about eighteen hundred.
Um, until then, you had the survival of something interesting and odd.
The survival of a pre-feudal, near dark-age tribal society in Britain.
Though, in a gradually contracting area.
The Gaels of Scotland, had not overall had a successful history.
They had founded the Kingdom of Scotland as the Scottish monarchy.
Um, this is the age that Shakespeare makes famous.
The age of King Duncan, and MacBeth, and Malcolm Canmore, they're all Gaelic-speaking.
And_ but Malcom Canmore who married an English wife.
And paradoxically introduced some Norman aristocrats to Scotland, and turned southern Scotland round to an Anglo-French civilisation.
But even in the sixteenth century, um, the Gaelic-speaking area was about a half of Scotland, in terms of population.
By the, um, seventeen hundreds however, it was about one seventh of the population.
And wild parts of lowland Scotland were progressing, the Gaels much less so.
And then came the disaster of Culloden.
Um, nevertheless, um, we have, an immense loss of a language and culture.
Culloden is the turning point.
Um, Wordsworth celebrates, or remarks on this, in his, um, poem about the girl reaping in the Hebrides.
Um, when he is a tourist there in the early eighteen hundreds.
She's singing it in Gaelic, and he says, he writes, 'will no one tell me what she sings.
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow, of sad, far off, forgotten things, and battles long ago.
' That's extremely likely, because that about sums up Highland history.
Um, by, the eighteen fifties, the Highlands are fashionable again.
Queen Victoria builds Balmoral there, expands it.
She has her servants in Highland dress, she has her special friend John Brown, an outspoken Highland servant.
And the Royal Family have been wearing kilts, in spite of their predominantly German blood, and going there ever since.
People that go up the Highlands to shoot.
But the thing is, that the Highlands, like a tiger, turned into a hearth rug, have been pacified completely.
Um, an interesting, if obstreperous society, and civilisation, is, burning very low.
I think about eighty thousand or ninety thousand people speak Scottish Gaelic.
There are more people in Scotland who speak Urdu, and uh, one can, in a sense, I think, regret it.
Um, for a long time, the destruction of the Highlands wasn't regretted.
The lowland Scots didn't like the Highlanders.
And, English historians would say it's all in the, um, name of progress.
The early twentieth century historian, Trevellian, himself the great, uh, gr_ nephew of, a man of Highland descent, Jim McCauley.
Who_ and McCauley was somebody who, although of Highland descent disapproved of the Highlanders.
But Trevellian said, an Afghanistan could not be tolerated fifty miles from the modern Athens.
Meaning enlightenment Edinburgh.
Nowadays we would take perhaps a more sympathetic view of Highland civilisation.
What it has done of course, is spread the Highlanders all over the, um, world, in a sense.
So, you get, upper class Englishman of Highland descent.
Like Harold MacMillan, who became Prime Minister of England, and married Duke's daughters.
And, um, that kind of thing.
But, the Highlands itself, really is gone.
It's a vast, empty countryside"
"I think the best way to characterize a cold war is, um, as, as, as a last phase in, um, in a battle, um... Of western intellectualism, um, played out, played out on a global scale.
And, um, the reason i, i, i, I say that that i- that it is a battle, um, between different intellectual currents in the West.
Is because even though... Um, many countries around the world, that are not part of the West, uh, absorbed the ideologies of, Marxism and Leninism, and socialism and communism.
These are Western intellectual currents.
And this,  this battle really begun with the, French Revolution.
Um, you know, and the ideas of, um, equality and fraternity and... Um, there is one more that I forget, equality, fraternity, uh_  anyhow, um, and_ and there, uh, socialism, um, came to the fore in the West, in the nineteenth century.
And, um, there's been many, many, um, currents within the Socialist movement.
But, but basically, um, you know, i- it evolved and, and it came to power, um, as, as, as, as as Leninism, in the, in the Soviet Union.
And, and, and i- the_ this, this ideological conflict, uh, uh, was played out on a global scale.
And, and Western liberalism vanquished f- fascism which, which is another, uh, Western uh,ideological construct, about how men should live, um, and it, it vanquished, um, it vanquished, uh, Communism.
Um, I don't_ many people say that, um, that the only, the, the only victorious Western ideology, at the end of the cold war, and at the end of this millennium is neo-liberalism.
Uh, I think socialism is not dead, ideologically speaking.
But I think throughout this century, um, you know, throughout the cold war, uh, socialism in a particular form of power, because it was defeated and, and, and, and because... Um, there haven't been any other alternatives for people to see.
Uh, for many people it is hard to imagine, uh, uh, that, that socialism has any, any, any life left to it.
Uh, I think it does, uh, it's just that, that as a form of, uh, of, uh, po- of social and political power, it has been, it has been defeated.
Um, and that's, I think that's what the cold war was about.
Um, not, not so much, about leaving one social ideology victorious.
But simply about proving, that, some ideologies, um, when they take a certain form of power, uh, are not feasible or are not, um, do not work out in reality, the way that they, they were supposed to work out.
Uh, you know, and, uh, the cold war in that respect is, uh, is an eighty year struggle, uh, since the Russian Revolution."
"Immediately following the, uh, United Nations conflict shall we say in South_ on the Korean peninsula in the early nineteen fifties.
The Koreans immediately had to rebuild their economy.
And, first of all we must take a very brief look at, uh, this South Korean social structure.
The South Koreans, um, very similar to a lot of East Asians had been quite useful_ used, used to a monarchical system.
And the most powerful, um, politicians of their time had been monarchs.
Um, one may go back as, um, as early as the Joseon Dynasty or the  or the (Yee) Dynasty.
Or even as recent, um, as the late nineteenth century, um, with the Daewongun and, um, other dynastic claims, or those dynastic claimants to the throne, um, in Seoul.
The Koreans needed to reconstruct both a government and, plus a stable economy after centuries of having been ravaged, by Yuan China, by Ming China, by the Japanese.
And even by infiltrations from foreign powers, including the Russians, the English, and the United States of America.
The Koreans were ready to actually, seek some level of sovereignty.
Unfortunately what had happened after the liberation from Japan.
The allied forces, had had to make a decision as to what sort of form, the Korean government must take.
Kim Il-Sung and a group of socialist dissidents, had already claimed that the mo- the movement towards the left_ the precedent that had been set by Maoist China should be followed by South Korea.
Or by Korea in general shall we say, unified Korea.
The Maoist example had already been established by Korea.
And Kim Il-Sung believed that it was best that worker collectives be organized, um, throughout Korea.
The Americans though, seeing a complete lack of organization on the part of more rightist elements, uh, within the Korean society propped up the Korean born minister from Hawaii, known as Syngman Rhee.
Syngman Rhee had spent quite a lot of time in Washington.
Unbeknownst to a lot of his um compatriots, o- on the Korean peninsula.
The idea being that Rhee would establish a more pro-American, um, organization on the Korean peninsula.
Um, filling the vacuum, um, o- on behalf of the Western allies.
A vacuum that obviously could possibly precipitate the movement of Korea, to al- alliances, um, within extreme leftist China, or socialist China shall we say.
What precipitated, um, the movement especially was the organization of Russian troops along the Yalu River, immediately after the surrender of Japan.
And the Russians sought to, reclaim some of the allegiances they had made with the Daewongun, and with his councilors, especially in the late nineteenth century.
The claimants had sheltered a lot of the dynastic claimants to the, the Korean throne within Russian embassies.
Within Russian legations.
And some of them had even been educated, um, at in Moscow.
The Russians saw it therefore as their, uh, sphere of influence to move into Korea.
And the Americans of course, believed that that land which was liberated, um, from Japan and which they had had prior claims, um, to some extent, um, could obviously_ um should fall within a pro-American sphere.
And this led to the precipitation, um, of the Korean conflict and the demarcation of a North and a South Korea.
The desire to unify the peninsula on the other hand.
Especially on the part of Kim Il- Sung and his group of patriots, caused the actual invasion in nineteen fifty-one of, the southern portion of the peninsula.
Um.
Kim Il-Sung realizing that the United Nations forces would probably overwhelm his much smaller, uh, force sought to, uh, find aid in Maoist China.
And the resulting conflict led to a Chinese-American conflict for all intents and purposes along, um, the Korean peninsula.
Wherein the Americans lost thirty-thousand men and the Chinese lost three-million.
Immediately following the war, which as many conflicts along the Korean peninsula had left it_ the Korean peninsula was devastated.
Seoul was essentially rubble.
In as much as Tokyo had been rubble, uh, in nineteen forty-five.
The Koreans therefore had to, find a means of generating, um, an economy that could produce capacity.
Could, um, bring a lot of, a lot of unemployed, um, back into the fold of mainstream economics.
And reduce the proliferation of black market.
Especially within the urban centers Daegu, Kwangju, Pusan, Osan and, uh, Seoul.
Then move them back into the mainstream economy and reduce crime.
There had always been, um, a system of cronyism.
There had always been a system of, of shall we say, flatterers or sycophants before the Korean throne and this was the_ that system found itself resurrected, in terms of cronyism.
A sort of cronyist capitalism, um, that has become the trademark of South Korea.
These certain families.
Or certain established families who held large tracts of land and held a lot, much capital.
Or had their capital preserved by the U-N forces_ that is the U-N forces recognized their, their claims to certain amounts of equity, uh, following the withdrawal of the United Nations occupying forces.
And the, the establishment of the demilitarized zone.
These families for the most part were the embryos of today's chaebols.
Or the Korean equivalent of the zaibutsu.
They found that, the Korean government, although repr- purportedly representative and that was the, the aim of the United Nations, um, upon leaving the Korean peninsula, the, the South Korean government would essentially be one elected by the people.
But nevertheless the_ you cannot take, uh, that which is Korean out of the Koreans.
There would still, um, be_ even at the Blue House, the same sort of sycophantic relationships between those propertied, um, those, uh, property councilors, um, to the government, uh, in Seoul.
The tables were therefore formed, first as bodies of capital, um, in the same means that Japan sought to appropriate Western technology, for the generation of manufacturing interests for, for industry, so did the Koreans.
Um, largely through_ i- in in the beginning largely through direct contact with, uh, the United Kingdom, with the United States, and with Western Europe.
And then eventually as it progressed into the nineteen sixties and early nineteen seventies, began licensing technology from the Japanese.
When_ then the primary recipients from the West, and then the South Koreans as the secondary recipients of the west.
Largely these agreements, um, for, uh, licensing of technology and for movement of capital and credit, fell into_ largely into the hands of these, um, families that were closely associated with the government in Seoul.
Um, what made it, um, even more, um, more similar to the p_ late nineteenth century, um, the Korean government was the fact that for the most part Koreans, were under the thumb of dictators.
Um, it was Park Chung-hee and his ascension to dictatorship, uh, in Korea in the nineteen-sixties that led to the acceleration of the South Korean economy.
Park Chung-hee believed that the only way to establish, a vibrant economy, for a nation that cannot possibly rely on large amounts of assets.
Preexisting assets and a large amount of, uh, native national resources.
Is to have an export driven economy, mainly through a very highly potent productive economy.
So for all intents and purposes the South Koreans, looked to model, um, their economy on, on the hierarchical structure of the Japanese economy which was succeeding at the time.
And particularly in the, um, early nineteen-seventies, um, just prior to his assassination, um, the Japanese were already beginning to catch up with the Americans.
Or pass the Americans i- in automobile manufacture for instance.
The South Koreans saw that, the consolidation, of large portions of the productive sector in the hands of the chaebol was probably a very productive way to go about it.
Uh, or go about reconstructing their economy.
And that tight capital regulation and an export driven economy was the way to go.
Um, those successors to Park Chung-hee.
Um, and even the first democratically, um, elected, um, president of South Korea Rho Tae-Woo followed the exact same policies.
And the policies, um, were not disrupted until the government of Kim Young-Sam, and especially, um, the intervention on the part of the United States Department of Treasury with the sup_ purported equity crisis that was cited by the chaebols during the administration of Kim.
The belief was that the chaebols, had become world class.
They had now attained the same level of competition.
Or the same ability to compete with the Americans and the Western Europeans as had the Japanese.
Regardless of their, their very much smaller capacity in terms of churning out products and churning out a return on investment, that the Japanese corporations had.
Nevertheless the Koreans believed that they were ready to play, uh, in the big leagues, in terms of high volume manufacturing.
Realizing that they could not expand, um, without equity, without assets.
They needed massive amounts of credit and the fact that all the cren_credit in Korea couldn't supply Daewoo, uh, Lucky Goldstar, um, Hyundai, um, and Samsung with enough of_ enough capital to cause these expansions.
They and along with pressure on the part of the United States Department of Treasury, opened Korean capital markets.
This was the beginning of the disaster in South Korea.
Essentially the, flow of short-term credit, the inability for these chaebols who were essentially, used to operating under_ in a protectionist environment.
And therefore, somewhat inefficiently there are portions of their of their monopolies that, weren't as efficient as they would like to be in order to be truly world class, fell through the holes.
And essentially they were not able to meet the profit targets they needed in order to keep their interest rates, and their short-term credit low.
This precipitated, uh, the Korean crisis.
The Korean credit crunch.
Rather than immediately slapping capital, capital constraints back on the economy.
And finding some way of these chaebols to sell assets, to make up their debt.
Instead what happened was an American led, American led pressure upon Kim Young-Sam and his successor, Kim Dae-Jung to leave capital markets alone and allow what was, thereto fore only a, a financial crisis.
Then move into the productive sectors of the Korean economy.
Now this, this is where a crisis becomes less a, a subject of crony capitalism.
Less a subject of the chaebols falling down on the job so to speak.
And more a, a scenario wherein the United States of America has a direct, uh, activist_ of participation in the deconstruction shall we say of the Korean, uh, economy.
Now the idea, um, being that the productive economy must also fall victim to this credit crisis.
And in so doing allow foreign investors_ I mean the need for more investors the- then comes to the fore.
And the need for foreign investors to start purchasing the capital of these otherwise Korean companies.
And therefore introducing more and more foreign intervention, into what theretofore had been a successful economy.mind you, um, from the late middle nineteen sixties up until the nineties, Korean growth in terms of real economic growth of the projective economy was seven to ten per cent.
Which is miles ahead of any other industrialized nation.
Probably with the exception of the Japanese bubble economy during the nineteen eighties.
That just_ those two economies are essentially the fastest growing, uh, in the world.
Um, the fact that the Japanese always maintained, capital controls up until, the fa- up until the late nineties, when they hones_  or the mid-nineties, when they believed that their, that their companies were sufficient, or had sufficient assets to compete on the world stage.
And they had sufficient foreign assets to back up, any, any credit_ any short term credit crisis for the Japanese economy.
The South Koreans didn't follow this model.
And what they have allowed themselves in, in this way, and, uh, already having lost their political sovereignty to occupied forces.
The Chinese in the North, and the Americans in the South.
Having already lost their political sovereignty are now in a situation where they are losing their economic sovereignty.
Now those corporations which are responsible for their high growth, uh, export led economy are being controlled by foreigners.
And this has well it has led to, um, South Korea's massive protest.
Or the massive descent on the part of trade unions, and labor within Korea, um, on the very restrictive International Monetary Fund positions in Korea, and also the really_ the real worry on the part of Koreans, that their future is no longer in their hands.
The crisis in South Korea therefore comes down to this.
With the br- now having briefly discussed the situation of a war that has left Korea divided, and occupied by foreign forces.
And now a loss_ a slow loss of economic sovereignty the crisis, um, in Korea has now_ is now what it has been for thousands of years.
Which is essentially this.
Allow the Koreans to finally become masters of their own destiny.
This is not taking place.
They have now lost their po_ their economic sovereignty as well as their political sovereignty and it now becomes a question of whether Korea, will ever have a future that they can control."
"I think for, um, third world societies  to industrialize clearly the, most important asset, uh, required is not natural resources or, or capital.
Uh, or any of the other resources that were proved critical for the first wave of industrializers for the Western countries.
Uh,clearly what is needed in, in the case of the third world, um, is, uh... Uh, a certain kind of, um, um, social, um, make-up.
Um, or certain kinds of social structures in_ and loyalties that, uh, that governments or states can tap into, uh, when they set about the, the, you know, on this path of industrialization.
And for example when we compare, um, Africa versus, uh, Asia.
And when i say Asia here i'm not, um, i, i don't mean to include all of Asia because Asia is a huge continent.
I'm talking amount mainly North East Asia, um, but we could also, uh, include with Africa many, uh, South East Asian countries.
Um the main difference we see is that, uh, North East A_ th- these North East Asian societies of Japan,  China and Korea mainly, um, are very homogeneous societies that have se- been settled for centuries.
Um, and with very defined patterns of authority.
With, uh, very clear, uh, lines of loyalties.
Um, so it is_ it, it, it's very easy for, for the, for the state to tap into those, uh, loyalties to, uh, channel that authority through particular, in particular ways, uh, to serve its own ends.
Um, i suppose because, um, uh, these, um, societies of North East Asia are very much_ are, are very confusion- very family centered.
Um, and so, uh, it is, it is relatively easy in this, in this case.
In the case of Africa we find the opposite.
Um, um, in the case of Africa for example we, we find that, uh, uh, there are no, uh_ first of all the topography, uh,of, of the continent it is,it is extremely adverse... Uh, to this, um, phenomenon of settling down um, a- and, and, and, and, and cultivating the land and, and being, uh, stable in one place for a long time.
I mean it's, it's a continent that, uh, that, that_ where geography doesn't permit that, so we have, um, societies that have moved around much more with, uh, um, with hardly, um, um_ where we hardly find clear loyalties, clear patterns of authority, usually they are very, uh, much overlapping or, or, or inter linked or_ so, it, it is very hard to, to, to, to sort out this hodgepodge of different, uh, ethnicity's, and religions and tribes and clans.
Um, and, and on top of that, um, um, Africa and and this is also true of South East Asia.
South East Asia is also_ you know, when we look at Indonesia for example.
It is also, you know,, a place of, you know, hundreds of different ethnic groups, religions, tribes and, you know, races, dialects.
Um, so it is very difficult for, uh, for, um, you know, an indigenous, um, government to come to power and, and, and, and establish its own authority internally and externally.
And then set about this process of, social engineering and social construction.
In the case of East Asia, um, um, the crucial event is that Japan was able to avoid Western colonization.
So by avoiding Western colonization and industrializing it became a, colonizer.
Um, and when it colonized, uh, Korea and Taiwan it set about to do the same things, that it had done only, only, um, much more intensely.
It set about to do the same things that it had done, uh, before on its own.
In the case of Africa, uh, in South East Asia, um, these societies couldn't, they couldn't sort out, you know, this problem of, um, of, of conso- of power of con- uh, of consolidation of power and authority.
And they couldn't avoid colonialism.
And when colonialism came to these, societies it only, reinforced these trends.
And, you know, Japanese colonialism in Taiwan and Korea reinforced social cohesion, reinforced, patterns of authority, uh, and, um, and, and loyalties because they were there already and they were strong.
When, when colonialism in particular, Western colonialism came to, Africa and South East Asia, um, it couldn't_ it, it also couldn't do what these societies by themselves had not done.
So it only reinforced those cen- those centrifical tendencies.
Uh, it, it only dispersed things even more, uh, than they would.
Tha- than they had been before they came.
So their_ the overall effects of colonialism in, in, in Africa and South East Asia, uh, have been very pervasive, and have contributed to this problem."
"What differentiates, uh, western musical tradition, from other musical, other wor_ other work_ other work_ musical traditions.
Well, basically, uh, with western musical tradition we should gauge, we should judge, what was produced in the later mid_ in the late middle ages.
Because, what was_ what was earlier, was produced earlier, first of all, there, there's a very scarce written record of it.
Because, uh, for example, if we_ if we start fo_ if we start, um, western musical tradition with wes_ with what we_ we will regard, uh, today as western musical culture.
We start with Greece, and, uh, Ancient Greece.
Me saying_ my saying_ me saying, um, these, these cultural areas.
But in this_ in this_ in this era, in this uh, age, music was not written, because it was part of a_ part of_ of_ of_ mm_ of, uh poetry, part of the theatre.
Of tragedy, and, and, and, and comedy.
So it was not really, an independent, item of culture.
An independent, uh... Uh, piece of culture.
When it became so, basically, apart from Gregorian Chant, is when music acquired it's polyphonic status.
With polyphony we usually mean the, uh, multilayered musical structure, in which two or more voices are sounding together.
Why's_ was this change so important.
Uh, because this required, hum, required for the first time, written_ written_ written, uh, to_ to devise a written_ a written musical system.
Because in order to_ in for two or more voices to proceed together, and in a consequent way.
It makes sense to make harmonic sense.
They needed to, to, uh, plan it_ plan it in advance.
And this was made possible only by writing it down.
So, basically, uh, this, this allowed music to_ to grow in, in, in, in, in wider and wider complexity.
Which was not possible if music wasn't wh_ uh, had not been written down.
Uh, this, this, this growing complexity_ I can find, of course, the knowledge of mo_ of most western musical tradition after the development of polyphony.
Which is to be situated, uh, at the beginning of, um, uh, the eleventh century.
This allowed_ as I was saying allo_ allo_ allowed music to be, uh, developed on a very much technical basis.
And fewer people were able to understand it.
And it required a technical preparation.
A technical training, which in other_ in other musical traditions it was not.
So, it was_ it does not_ of course it was required.
There were_ there were some_ some, some specialists.
But they were not so separated from other people.
They were not_ they were not really, uh, professionals.
Uh, this, a_ as i_ as I was saying, this allowed, a grow_ a growing com_ complexity, uh, which, uh, accentuated the mathematical aspect of music in western musical tradition.
And in order to justify it culturally, musicians tended to link it to, uh, curiously enough, to Greek theor- later_ later Hellenistic theo_ theories.
Which sa_ saw music, basically, as a.
As a, um, mathematical study of man, and, and the cosmos.
And they tried to justify it in this way, of course.
But, um_ which detached even more music_ uh, mu_ uh, written music making from, from, um, from other_ from other kinds of music making.
But, this in itself means that, uh, in, in the Western musical culture.
At least until, um, until the Renaissance, until later Renaissance.
Music_ written music was not at all the prevailing aspect of music.
Because, uh, in, in_ mus_ written music was mainly developed in, for example, the south of England, France, and northern Italy.
But in other parts of Europe, uh, it persisted for a long time, an unwritten musical tradition which was much more prevalent.
Much more_ has_ had much more import on, on, on, on, uh, um the cult_ cultural life of these countries.
And even in the countries that_ where_ where written musical tradition developed.
It was for a very long time confined to a very limited circ_ to  very limited circles.
Uh, to verily_ to very elitist circles.
And, um, for example, within the universities, or within the cathedral.
Within a cathedral, um... Cantors.
[Cough]in other musical traditions, with non-western musical traditions, musicians are usually_ have not, a, a totally_ a totally professional separated status.
And, uh, the knowledge, and the mu_ the music knowledge is much more linked to_ to their_ to their musical_ to their, uh, uh, wider, cultural environment.
And they're not, uh, uh, and then they don't rea_ they're not_ they're not so much linked to written tradition.
I- in some cases they have no written tradition at all.
In others, they have it.
But it's just, uh, it_ it just_ it just_ and, uh, a, an (xx xx).
It doesn't have_ really have, uh, um, it's all really basic for_ for_ for_ uh, for them to, to perform music.
So, basically, uh, what differentiates music_ western musical culture from others_ from other musical cultures, is the writing, is the written, is the relevance, uh, put on the written, uh_ put on writing.
Which is_ which has become far more, far, uh_ far more interesting for, for, for western culture than_ than improvis_ improvisatory music making.
And which differentiates, and is, uh, not only from musical_ western musical tradition from other cultural traditions.
But also from_ from so called non-classical popular musical traditions in the western world."
"Molecular biology, is a mixture of fields.
Molecular biology has drawn its origins from our ability to look at the chemical level, of genetics for, an assortment of species.
What do molecular biologists do.
There are varied occupations for molecular biologists.
The first molecular biologists were geneticists and physicists.
Or more particularly, the field has been dominated, by geneticists who have decided to look at individual species, and see exactly how they work.
From the subatomic, to the la- macro molecular level.
And, when I say macro molecular, large molecules.
Like protein, and D-N-A and large complex sugars, like carbohydrates.
The first molecular biologists were geneticists who wanted to know, how do we get from a simple D-N-A molecule, to a complex animal.
Like a frog for instance.
Most modern day molecular biologists have moved beyond these very basic genetic questions.
And, moved to studying how the individual component,  of the, intracellular machinery of a complex organism, interact with each other.
And how they cause the organism to function.
How are the genes within the organism turned on and off.
How is the internal cellular physiology of the organism regulated by the movement of proteins, and the interaction of proteins within the given cell.
Most biologists_ most molecular biologists study this on a day-to-day basis.
They use varied techniques to manipulate the D-N-A of small organisMs  from as small as, yeast and bacterium, to animals even as large as frogs and mice.
The intent, is to look at how a- adult organism functions and these are the primary concerns of the molecular geneticist.
Another field of molecular biology, is referred to as developmental biology.
The sou- the soul purpose of developmental biology is to look at the development of a unicellular egg, um, into a complex organism.
Um, such as a ra- a newborn mouse.
How do we develop in the uterus.
The focus of developmental biology is to look at how, genes are turned on and off.
And how, they therefore regulate the development of (niche) and structures within, uh, within organisms in, within, uh, the womb.
How do we developed_ how do we develop five digits instead of six.
Why are our eyes i- in the middle of our heads rather than, lets say, uh, on opposite ends of our shoulders.
How do these things happen.
Because the simple linear genetic code of D-N-A spatially regulate the development of organs in three dimensions is_ may seem like questions, better given to a mathematician.
Possibly better given to a physicist.
But, despite the seeming move from, linear D-N-A information, to three-dimensional beings, can actually be very easily explained, using the modern techniques of molecular biology.
Yet another field, involves biochemistry.
Biochemistry has been used to identify, uh, mainly the structures of organisms and particularly the structures of small macro molecules.
This sub field of biochemistry would be referred to as, structural biology.
Structural biology finds its purpose, in looking at how proteins, though seemingly all the same, from a macro molecular standpoint are very very complicated.
And, their structure determines their function.
Their main_ and this structure and function inter relationship, is the principle dogma of structural biology.
The way in which portions of our protein when seen at the atomic level,  a very very complicated structure.
How these mechanisms interact with one another, can give us an explanation.
How these proteins can act as enzymes, for instance.
How do certain portions of the protein act as arms, to potentially grasp a small chemical.
And then yet, another portion of a protein, become involved in manipulating that chemical once it is in the grasp of the protein itself.
The such_ structural biologist have also been interested in how D-N-A consider just a very linear molecule, as twists and kinks, curves, structure, um, in three dimensions.
And how it, through using, through changes in its structure, changes in its three dimensional structure can interact with proteins, and how this is key, uh, to the regulation of physiology within the cell.
And within the simple organism in macro scope_ in macro.
The structural biologist has become more and more important, as more and more companies, and more and more universities become interested in manipulation through the use of small chemicals.
And, through engineering of D-N-A, through not merely restriction enzymes which are used to cleave the D-N-A, and manipulate it physically.
But also, through use of small chemicals, they can intrude into the D-N-A, and change the way it behaves, at a physical level.
The need to be able to look at these molecules at an atomic level, is incredibly important.
Yet another field within biochemistry.
Aside from structural biology, is virology.
One is extremely concerned, as to how viruses not only look_ these items being addressed by both structural biologists and virologists, but also how they behave.
Uh, a vir- a virus is not a living organism.
It depends solely upon the physiology of the organism that it infects to replicate itself.
To make copies of itself.
To have its own physiology unquote.
Without a host organism, a virus is just a lump of protein, of a little bit of D-N-A.
But once its actually associated with an organism, it's animated.
So viruses have achieved a semi-living, uh, status within biology.
Are they really alive.
Are they really organism, in and of themselves.
Are they symbiotes.
Which are sy_ are organisms that depend on other organisms to survive.
What are they.
And this debate has raged, and is a large amount of the study of viruses.
They want to be able to understand how the virus does what it does within an organism, and how it causes disease.
These are just a few of the fields, uh, within molecular biology.
All of them separate, in there, fiefdoms as is true in any university.
But, yet, at the same time, all integrated in a common cause of understanding a life on this planet."
"Early part of the nineteen hundreds_ actually, er- early part of the twentieth century_ Alfred North Whitehead and his student Charles Hartshorne, developed a new cosmology.
A very interesting cosmology based on the process... Idea of process.
That is, rather than the idea, of a concrete god.
Or one_ or the idea of a, of a materialism that was largely static.
Uh, Whitehead and Hartshorn developed an idea of process philosophy.
Wherein, all experiences, um, and all matter, are essentially organic, constantly changing.
So this was a revolution over the Augustinian God, the, the God of Aquinas.
The philosophical God that stood in omniscient and omnipotent observing the activities of his creation.
But rather was a God that evolved with creation.
The radical change that brought_ was brought about by Whitehead and Hartshorne largely went into the development of process theology.
Was the idea that, God did not necessarily know,all things, uh, beforehand.
He was not necessarily, um, one who saw the future, but rather developed with the future.
God's ideas, um, were not necessarily, um, coercive ones, but rather ones of persuasion.
God was, i- infinitely knowledgeable of the possibilities with which_ his organic creation could develop, but wasn't necessarily one that provided it with only a single deterministic movement through history.
So, how does one, come from_ how does one establish a brand new cosmology.
And that what, was so incredibly innovative  about Whitehead, and Hartshorne pursuit.
White- Whitehead had already established his reputation as an eminent mathematician, and philosopher of mathematics in writing the multi-volume <i>Principia Mathematica</i> with Bertram Russell.
Where their attempt was to reduce all of the field of mathematics to basic logic.
That is starting with arithmetic and moving up, to vector calculus and linear algebra.
Reduce all the major axioms of mathematics to basic logic.
Uh, this great work had already made the two men world famous and... Russell and Whitehead went their separate ways, Russell on to develop, um, greater axioms within the philosophy of language with Ludwig Wittgenstein.
And North Whitehead ended up coming across the Atlantic to teach at Harvard University.
Where after years of developing the ideas [Bartford and Precipia] moved on to cosmology.
And to interesting ideas that stem not only from evolutionary theory.
That is the theory that had, um, the theory that had been brought into philosophy largely by Herbert Spencer.
Whose outmoded views had fallen into, uh, disuse and unpopularity.
But largely by the ideas of creative evolution of Henri Bergson and William James, who at_ then was at Harvard University.
Uh, Whitehead began with the idea that all experience, comes from, what he referred to as objective, uh, objective occurrences.
That is instances of experience that come into being, uh, reach satisfaction or what he calls concrescence and then perish.
The idea is that these individual experiences, tiny shall we say subatomic experiences come into, bet- come into being, evolve to a state of satisfaction and, then die, leave some of physical, uh, or what he calls ""prehension"" behind them.
Such that other experiences which come into being, um, afterward are affected by, its movement towards satisfaction.
Um, large accumulations of these experiences, um, aggregate to form societies.
Societies can move in a mor_ either one or two ways.
If they are very rapid, um, uh, rapid instances.
That is instances that come into being, um, concress or are satisfied within the given society.
And then are not prehended.
That is they come into being and then they immediately perish without prehension, or without understanding.
Then these are the experience that form material objects, largely inanimate objects.
If on the other hand, there are societies that are formed amongst all of these experiences that come into being.
They maybe do not have a, a, such a incredibly short or transient move to concrescence or satisfaction.
Um, and then perish and are prehended or understood by other or, uh, affect other experiences that come into being afterward.
They are intelligent.
They are for mental societies.
And therefore that can give rise to animate objects.
Society is that, the more densely a society, um, is, uh, more densely a society is packed shall we say.
Or the denser the created society, the closer and closer and closer that such movements towards con_ to concrescence and then prehension if from consciousness.
In that way Whitehead served to counteract a lot of the theories of evolutionary biologists.
Who came to think that intelligence was likely an accident.
It was also, Whitehead's way of taking Bergson's idea of creative evolution and making it_ putting logical axioms, um, to his ideas of the development of creativity and the development of mental processes.
One can see from this idea that Whitehead develops, that soc- society_ societies of experience lend themselves to life in general.
That is life is not a determinic_ deterministic process, that is a process that is governed by static laws of physic or economics or mathematics, for instance, but is inherently creative.
And this lent itself greatly to the, to the philosophies of pragmatism that, at time were beginning to flourish in the early twentieth century in the United States.
And established Whitehead, uh, Whitehead's cosmology in specific, as being central.
Uh, this is often not_ he is not often given the credit for being one of the main, um, metaphysicians of pragmatism.
But is one of the core concepts within pragmatism and gave it its metaphysical foundation.
So, given the idea that such societies evolve.
And that certain, certain events come into being.
One must understand that in, every, every entity's movement towards satisfaction is not the same.
Even though he gives a very atomistic view.
Each of these experiences is governed by its environment.
How does one, e- achieve satisfaction.
How does one achieve concrescence.
And the way it is achieved, determines the movement of the soc– society or grouping of experiences in total.
There must be something.
There must be a repository of possibilities.
This is inherent and makes sense.
There must also be an ultimate repository of prehension.
All of these experiences, if they are to become mental, and ultimately mental, in their aggregation must have some reservoir of understanding.
That is_ that reservoir is called God.
And there, um, Whitehead's movement of a cosmology moves into theism.
Moves onto that aspect or another.
The development of the theistic side of process philosophy, was handed over to Charles Hartshorne.
Who achieved his early fame by collecting the writings of the famous American pragmatist Charles Sanders Peers.
His multiple volume History of Peers, had established him at Harvard University after having graduated in only a single year with his doctorate.
And allowed him to pursue his interest with Whitehead_ in Whitehead's process philosophy.
Hartshorne, now, decided to apply process theo- philosophy to Christianity.
To be able to use the logical axioms of Whitehead's cosmology to justify such things as the, presence of evil, the logic of petitionary prayer.
Um, even the multiple existences of God, can God be plenipotentiary.
Can he have multiple existences.
And why should he.
Um, it also... Added flesh to the skeleton of Whitehead's idea that God is inherently a creative organ.
That God doesn't necessarily coerce his creation, but, gives it multiple possibilities and his morality, or the morality that is preached within theism is a means of influencing, um, influencing the subjects or the mental societies that exist in creation.
This, of course, philosophy sat very well with Americans.
Because it gave, um, great great weight to fre- to ideas of freedom, individualism and free will.
So therefore he takes Aquinas' obsession with free will, adds logical axioms, and then mixes in a little of America's obsession with ideas of individual freedom.
So hence, mental societies, um, are governed by God.
Are essential told... Or given the opportunity to either follow the laws... To directly oppose the laws, or ignore them.
And the influence of morality therefore is to essentially push, um, given mental societies in a given direction.
Towards an ultimate aim and towards the acceleration of satisfaction and the acceleration of concrescence.
Petitionary prayer makes sense in the sense, that mental societies, um, have a direct effect on God's own prehension.
That is God himself has also developed, himself or herself, depending upon you’re your feminist leanings or your, your, interpretation of gender roles within theology.
God therefore, relies upon mental societies and relies upon continuing, um, creation to develop himself.
And as he develops himself, he can therefore prehend or create even more possibilities within the landscape for the mental societies that he creates.
Petitionary prayer makes sense therefore, in that one, in moving toward satisfaction moves in the other direction that increases God's own ability, to meet satisfaction.
His satisfaction is infinite.
His, his prehension is infinite.
And his physical nature, or what is called the concrete nature, the only part of dividing concreteness that is maintained in the process of theology, is built up by us, so to speak, we the mental societies, on the planet are therefore in a symbiotic relationship with our God.
This radical idea, um, has a essentially profound influence on not only Protestant theology in the United States and in other English speaking countries.
But has had a great influence on liberation theologies, in the Third World.
Primarily the idea that, that petitionary prayer, um, can lead towards increased freedom for mental societies.
And for those Third World nations that have been the subject of colonialism that is occupation by larger economic powers and wish, to gain more freedom, more individual independence, such subsumption of process philosophy and deliberation theology has been incredibly, incredibly potent.
Therefore without knowing it the development of Whitehead and Hartshorn's process philosophy is stretched beyond mere cogitation on Harvard University's campus.
And has spread to the thoughts and minds and means, uh, by which people live their lives all around the world. "
"I'm often asked why I'm doing this.
I'm_ I find, I find musicology interesting.
And while I'm_ I'm perhaps wasting my time with these things.
Which are not at all, uh, useful for practical, uh, for empirical knowledge or for practical wo- work.
Perhaps this question should, uh, impinge upon whether, uh, I find_ whether_ and a- any people find_ why any people find, find_ a- any person finds interesting his particular_ his or her particular field of kno- knowledge or, of work.
Uh, at the moment, my field of work does not give me any money.
So, why do I find it interesting.
Well, it's perhaps because i_ because I'm, i, i, try to build up_ to build a career on it.
But, um, well... Was par_ was partly kidding.
No it was_ it was true.
But, uh, um, I find_ what I find interesting.
Musicology, rather than practical music, is that, uh, with musicology I try to_ I find it very useful for understanding music in a wider scope.
And, uh, what I really particularly_ personally find it int_ interesting is finding, how music works.
How a particular composer made his or her, uh, works meaningful.
Uh... I was_ I'm not part_ I'm not particularly talking_ or referring to if he or she attributed an external meaning to, to, to his work.
To his or her works.
But just to the fact on how it made them meaningful in themselves.
And wha_ what the structure_ if the work_ which i, which I am_ which i, which I'm working on, is, uh, it is a musical work.
I am_ I am analysing has, a cohesiveness of its own.
And whether this cohesiveness was, was also felt by his, by his contemporaries.
So, I'm interested for example, in early music.
Because, uh, uh... Because perhaps it's far more removed from our, from our, from our lives now.
And so in this way, the fact that I found- that I've find, uh, um, musicology interesting... As I was saying_ is that_ because i- i- it permits me_ it allows me to understand how, how a composer conceived its- its_ h- h- his works.
And, um... And i- it allows me to project myself into his mind, perhaps.
Well, th- tha- that says perhaps, uh, utopian, a utopian desire.
Which would nev_ which would w- w- would never be possible to be fulfilled.
But, uh, it's an ideal aim, which I always have in my mind when i, when I attempt to_ when I start to analyse any particular music at work.
But of course, musicology does not, does not ha_ just have to do with that.
With analysing musical works.
For some people, musicologists just, uh, um, trying to understand how mu_ how music was perceived.
So it doesn't_ they don't really need_ or they don't care about, uh, uh, technical musical knowledge, because they don't need it.
The- they rather research, uh, musical, um, conseq_ the consequences of, of certain musical attitude.
Or certain musical piece within a far, uh, broader, uh, sociological, uh, area.
And they try to, to understand this, as it is, is a much more sociologist than musicologist.
But, this is also musicology.
Or kind of musical psychology.
They t- try to study how, and why, a certain musical piece, of a certain musical area, uh, make people react in a certain_ uh, in a c_ make people respond in a certain, in a c_ kind of way.
And this, this is also_ this is also quite interesting.
Or, maybe one on_ can just be interested in the historical development of music.
Which, um, which, uh, again, does not have to impinge upon, uh, the technical- technical knowledge of the notation, or, things like that.
Or one just_ can just study the theo_ the theoretical knowledge, of a certain age.
Um, which is a meter_ uh, a meter_ a knowledge meter discourse.
And music is not_ it's not_ it's jus_ it's something with made, um... Above, or a- apart fro- from, uh, musical_ from music making in itself.
Its just, uh, ja.
So, musicology is al_ is all of these things.
And there's likely to be a_ i, i, personally like understanding, uh, how music, uh, technical music works, and that's it."
"The first recordings of, um, of written music in the western world, um, are linked to, uh, Gregorian Chant.
Or, what we know as 'Chant'.
And_ but in the_ in these_ in these, uh, cases, uh, um, uh, it was not_ what was fixed on the_ on the s_ on the page, was not really the pitch.
But the musical nuances.
Musical movement, um, um_ later on, uh, after Guido of Arezzo, uh, music was more, uh, it was given more impor_ the pitch, the exact_ the determination of pitch was given more importance.
Because uh, this of course facilitated, um, the apprehension.
The, uh, um, the, uh, memorisation of chant.
Which uh, monks, for example, in a_ in a cathedral, or in a convent had to do as_ as a matter of course.
As a matter of their daily duties.
And so, in this case, a written_ writing helped.
And much, um, later on with the development of polyphony, which I've mentioned before.
Is, a, a western musical tradition, um, uh, devised the_ a way of, of adding two or more texts, uh, contemp_ contemporaneously to, uh, in a, in a, in, in, in the same piece.
This, uh_ but i_ but at this time, um, fr_ at least until the_ until the beginning of fourteenth century, uh, m_ polyphonic music was written in score.
Later on, strangely, it was_ it was either more written_ it was written in separated parts.
And, uh, because, uh, each part was, was given to a_ to a singer.
And, uh, they didn't need, they didn't need to, to know where other singers was_ or, or were in a, in a determinant moment.
Because, uh, th_ it wa_ automatically being able_ be_ wa_ automatically able to recognise where they were, by calculating the mesuration of the notes.
The va_ the value of each note which, uh, and the relationship to each other.
Uh, this, this was, uh, the co-ordinator of polyphony which lasted until, uh, the late, the late, uh, sixteenth century, and which was dominated by nor- northern, uh, Franco-Flemmish composers.
In the late, uh, late sixteenth century, we_ it begins, uh, uh, to_ strong polyphonic traditions begins to fade.
And we have the first emergence of theatre, say of opera.
Which, uh, puts again into uh, uh, uh, relief the contribution of single voice.
Of, uh, of, of, of, uh, of monody.
T_ against a- an accompaniment of background.
Uh, which is actually what, what we are still more familiar with, with music.
And, uh, so the development of opera is very important.
As, uh, as of_ as the development of what we are, um, uh, wh_ what we define as, a, accompanied, uh, accompanied singing.
Accompanied music me- accompanied uh, uh, with accompaniment meaning a_ all what is instrumental.
Then of course the main musical line is sing- why the_ main musical line is singing.
Uh, in the end of, um, towards, towards the end o_ of the seventeenth century, uh, instrumental music was, uh, uh, was beginning to gain, to gain more credence between, uh, between, um, among the academic_ not the academic world, then the cultural, uh, the educated world.
And, um, it gradually became more and more independent from, uh, vocal music.
Which was put into_ which, uh, which went into a, a, a, improved, and a_ actually ac_ acquired this definitive status, as a_ if you can say so, in the end of the eighteenth century.
With beg_ with so called, uh, um, development of classical music.
Uh, with authors such as, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven which has_ which are past the author_ which is more fa_ uh, classical.
Which is, uh, uh, western classical authors best known for, for, for_ t- t- to every listener actually.
And this made, uh, instrumental music completely independent from singing.
So, uh, so we have a development of symphony, of sonata, of the concerto, which are completely independent from words.
Later on the romantic era, uh, uh, there was, uh, development of, uh, uh, very brief, uh, sort of brief lasting pieces.
Which, uh, uh, um, tended to, uh, reject, long, uh, unfolding, uh, classical music.
And, uh, tended to concentrate more on the, on the im_ on the momentary impressions, momentary feeling.
And was le_ was much less structured.
In the end of the nineteenth century, um, the, the, perfectioned, uh, tonal world, tonal world inde_ independent tonal world of classical music was, was finally, uh, broken out.
And, uh, sort of_ and d- d- and there were many composers who refused to compose within the tonal areas.
And tended to, um, uh, devise new, new means of composing outside of it.
Like Schoenberg and, and so on.
A- and, so we have development of, uh, of, or atonality.
Which, uh, uh, basically does not require anymore fixed, tall, uh, uh, um, frame.
And after that, the development of, uh, twelve tone music.
Which is the organisation of this atonality into a rational structure.
Which is, which is not anymore tonal anyway.
Because it's based on the equalisation of each of the twelve notes of the, uh, um, uh, chromatic scale.
And after that we have the_ a development of, um, uh, um, music which is more and more i_ involved with technical knowledge and with mathematics, uh, and so on.
Which is music of second force_ Second World War.
And, um, but parallel_ parallel to this we have dev_ development of so called popular music.
Perhaps because, um, music was more and more specialising into, uh, uh, um, a professional field, which people were less able to, to understand.
To grasp.
And so this sort of popular music which began with a late nineteenth century operetta, and uh, this so_ sort of light genre.
Um, tended to replace fo_ for the mass of the people what was before the concerto.
Or, or, such musical events which attracted more people.
And there was_ so, so, i- it came to build of this sort of double and, uh, some sense_ sometimes ignoring each other, uh, uh, to, um, two kinds of music.
Uh, which the popular music and the educated music.
Which is more and more_ which has been more and more, um the gap between these two kinds of music has been more and more evidenced_ stressed in the last_ in the last few decades.
In fact no_ I mean ap_ apart from very, very few people who are_ who are doing_ uh, dealing with this music.
Nobody knows anything about composers Stockhausen, (xx) and so on.
But everybody knows about, uh, uh, Bob Dylan, uh, or, uh, pop groups, uh, Dire Straits, uh, the Beatles, and I me_ I'm speaking of all the_ of older pop music because I don't know, uh, the newest ones.
So, um, so the, the, the ga- the gap between educated music and popular music is, is, is, is very_ is very big nowadays and, I don't know_ perhaps, if it's go- if it's going to be filled in it's because_ it's best because, uh, classical music is_ gets closer to popular music."

"  A. I work on Saturdays and in the school holidays. Saturdays are busy because that’s when everyone goes shopping. Our shop sells clothes and accessories for men, women and children.  I work in the children’s department. It can be crazy sometimes, but it’s fun.   B. I work during my summer holidays when I’m not at university. Oxford has thousands of tourists in the summer, so it’s easy to find a job as a tour guide. I take tourists to visit the university colleges and then we go down to the river. We go along the river on a boat. The tourists love the boat trip, but last summer one tourist fell in the river! I love meeting people from all over the world.   C. I like my job, but lots of people don’t like coming to see me because they hate dentists. Sometimes it’s very hard work, but it’s great to help people when they have a problem. It’s so important to look after your teeth.   D. My job is very difficult, but I like it because I love flying. I fly planes that take people to different places on holiday. Most of the time I fly in Europe to places like Spain, Greece and Italy. The most difficult thing about my job is when the weather is bad. Snow and thunderstorms are the worst. The best thing is visiting different places.   E. I work in a hospital in the city centre. It’s a very big hospital. I help the doctors with the patients. I give them their medicine and look after them when they feel ill. I love my job but I don’t like the uniform and sometimes I have to work at night. "

"Presenter 1: Today we are going to talk about names, particularly fashions in names, you know, the kind of names famous people use for their children. You’ve been looking into this recently, haven’t you Finn?
Presenter 2: I have indeed and it’s a fascinating topic. The US leads here with new names and we in Britain follow sometimes, but we tend to go for the more traditional names. So, the big trend is using nouns as names.
Presenter 1: Nouns, what sort of nouns?
Presenter 2: Well they can be abstract qualities like Honor or Passion. There’s a long tradition of this kind of name, like Faith or Charity, which used to be common names. A new name is Haven, that’s growing in popularity. And similar names like Shelter, Harbor and Bay also convey feelings of safety and warmth.
Presenter 1: Mmm. I suppose Passion is used to mean ‘  extreme enthusiasm’ nowadays, and people use the word a lot, so maybe it’s a good choice for a modern name. Haven has a nice, safe feel to it.
Presenter 2: OK, then there are names which come from nature or animals, although with some of these it’s hard to know whether they come from nature or a surname – that’s another trend. Here we have Frost, Wolf, Fox, Bear, for boys, of course. And a new name: Ridge.
Presenter 1: Ridge, like a mountain ridge? The top of a mountain range?
Presenter 2: Yes, weird, huh? It’s seen as a tough, outdoorsy name for a boy. OK, then there are musical names. Harmony and Melody have been around for ages, but Lyric is a new one.
Presenter 1: Lyric, wow!
Presenter 2: Yes, it came in at number 325 in the US a couple of years ago. That doesn’t sound very popular, but there are so many different names being used at the moment that it means it isn’t so unusual. Other noun categories are months – May, June and April are common, but January is uncommon and November very unusual. And then you have colours. Beyoncé and Jay-Z called their daughter Blue Ivy – a very distinctive name, a colour plus the name of a plant. Blue is very popular for girls right now, and Red or Grey for boys.
Presenter 1: I’ve just thought of another category. Food names, like Olive or Clementine.
Presenter 2: Yes, that’s another one. Flower names are pretty common, but food names are unusual. Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin named their daughter Apple, of course.
Presenter 1: Yes, poor child.
Presenter 2: Actually, Apple is becoming more and more popular, although people think that’s because of the technology connection, not the fruit. New names always seem strange at first, but you quickly get used to them, like all the names from places or jobs. Chelsea and Brooklyn seem like normal names now; they were strange when they were first used. Taylor, Mason, Cooper are all first names from jobs.
Presenter 1: And they are also surnames, I think that’s how they started.
Presenter 2: You’re probably right there.
Presenter 1: What about the Beckhams’ daughter, Harper?
Presenter 2: She was named after Harper Lee, the American novelist who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. That’s another trend, naming children after famous writers, musicians – the British band One Direction have had an effect on names – or fictional characters, like Bella or Edward from the Twilight series, or Hermione from Harry Potter.
Presenter 1: Sorry, can I just interrupt there. I’ve just has a message passed on by the producer. A listener has just phoned in with a very strange story about a family in Holland with six children. Their names are all anagrams of the letters: A, E, L and X.
Presenter 2: Ah yes, I’ve heard about this. This family are famous in the world of bloggers on names. Let me see if I remember the names … Alex and Axel … and Lexa – they’re the easy ones – Xela (Zela) and Xael (Zay-el) and the last one is Xeal (Zeal) – I’m guessing about the pronunciations, by the way.
Presenter 1: You mean there are names X-E-L-A  and X-A-E-L?
Presenter 2: Yes, but they are very unusual. I think the Dutch family are stopping at six children, but there are about eighteen more possible anagrams they could use.
Presenter 1: Nooo, you’re kidding!
Presenter 2: All seem horrible to me, but all are possible names. This is similar to another trend of giving children names all starting with the same letter, like the Kardashian family, all beginning with K, Kim, Kourtney and so on.
Presenter 1: The Kardashians have had enough publicity, let’s not talk about them. What about your name? Finn, that sounds like a good Irish name …  "
"For thousands of years the Maasai people in Kenya had no doubts about their relationship with the lions who shared the land with them. They were enemies. The lions wanted to kill the tribe’s livestock and the Maasai had to protect the animals. It was even part of the coming-of-age ritual of young warriors to kill a lion. But now things have changed and the Maasai are part of a new East African scheme to protect lions, called the Lion Guardians. The aim is for local people to be trained to manage and protect the lions without involvement from outsiders after the period of initial training. The Lion Guardians are taught basic literacy, how to manage data, how to deal with conflict between humans and lions, GPS and telemetry tracking of radio-collared lions. Some of them also learn how to speak in public and how to blog.

  The Lion Guardians monitor the lions and other carnivores and inform cattle herders when to avoid the areas where there are lions. They also help improve the livestock enclosures and educate people about wildlife. Helping find lost livestock is another important job. In the past these would often have been killed by carnivores. If anyone is about to carry out a lion hunt, the Lion Guardians try and persuade them not to. Since many of the Guardians have killed lions in the past and are very experienced, they are highly respected in the community and are listened to by their age-mates, or peers, and often by their elders. They explain the importance of the lions to culture and tourism and how they can now be arrested for killing protected animals.

  One such Lion Guardian is Olubi Lairumbe. He has killed seven lions in his lifetime. The last one was a lioness who was pregnant with five cubs. He regretted killing her very much, had a massive change of heart and volunteered to become a Lion Guardian. Olubi’s father used to hate lions and encouraged his sons to hunt them, but since Olubi became a Guardian, he has been advising them not to kill carnivores. Olubi was recently interviewed by Sir David Attenborough and appeared on the Africa documentary series.

  Another Guardian, Mingati Makarot, is very good at tracking lions using his traditional skills and has a great knowledge of the area that acts as a refuge to many wildlife species. Mingati is a past lion killer but has completely converted to being one of its ardent protectors. His name, Mingati, is a ‘lion name’ given to him meaning one who is fast and doesn’t lag behind.

  In the past, a moran (a Maasai warrior) received a lion name after spearing a lion. In Maasai culture the name represents the characteristics of both the warrior and the lion he has killed. A warrior with a lion name feels that he has achieved something great. When the successful warrior brings the lion’s mane and tail back to his manyatta (his home in the community) to be put on display, he is treated as a hero. Other young men who don’t yet have their lion names are called by the general name of ‘moran’. They long to have recognition and dream about the day that it will be their turn to bring home the lion trophy.

  Now, this naming tradition is changing. The Lion Guardians experimented by giving lion names to boys who had not killed lions and it worked. Other young people called them by the lion names, then the older people did so too.There were still some boys who wanted to do something to prove their bravery, and they were assigned conservation tasks to do. Now young men can earn respect by protecting lions, rather than killing them.

  Another change is that the lions are now given Maasai names and each has a card explaining who the lion is related to and which lions they keep company with. Personalising the lions helps them to be seen as individuals by the community.

  Since the programme began in 2007, no lions have been killed in the area patrolled by Lion Guardians. Compare that to a similar neighbouring area without Guardians, where 63 have been killed, and you can see just how successful the scheme is. The Maasai have managed to successfully adapt their culture to changing times without giving up their identity.

"A (Girl 1):
 	My hero isn’t very famous, but she ought to be. She’s Mary Anning, who was only 12 years old and from a poor family when she made an amazing discovery. She found the first dinosaur skeleton, that of an ichthyosaur, on the cliffs of Lyme Regis in the south of England. That was in 1811, and until then people had thought that it was impossible for an animal to become extinct. Because she was a woman and didn’t have enough money for a proper education, she wasn’t able to take part properly in the scientific community of the time. But she read as much scientific literature as she could and continued to search for fossils, often risking her own life to get them by climbing dangerous cliffs. She once nearly died in a landslide which killed her dog. Although she didn’t write famous books about fossils, her contribution to paleontology, the study of fossils, is said to be enormous. I admire her because she kept on trying to make new discoveries at a time when usually only men, and men with money, were allowed to be scientists. After her death the writer Charles Dickens said that ‘the carpenter’s daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it’. B (Boy 1): 
 	My hero is Kailash Satyarthi, who has been campaigning against child slavery for years. He is from India and first became aware of the problem of children working when he was 6 and noticed that a boy younger than himself had to spend all day polishing shoes and was unable to go to school. When he was 11, he began to collect money to help buy textbooks for other children, and when he was 26 he gave up his job as an electrical engineer to fight child slavery in India, by doing things like raiding factories where children were forced to work, making rugs or glass bottles. He introduced a programme first called RugMark, now known as Goodweave, which puts tags on child-labour-free rugs made in factories. He has saved many thousands of children, over 80,000, from a terrible life of enforced labour in South Asia and helped them to get an education. He has often been physically attacked for helping children, for example for trying to free Nepalese children forced to work in a circus. He regularly risks his life to fight injustice; two of his colleagues have been murdered. I believe that the best thing he has done is to change how people think about child slavery and to make it an international issue. C (Boy 2):
 	I’m really interested in ecology and my hero, or heroine, is Rachel Carson because she first got people thinking about the way we humans are causing permanent damage to the Earth’s ecosystems. She began as a biologist, specialising in writing about the sea, but she gradually became aware of the danger of  using pesticides like DDT and the way they can harm the whole of the food chain, from the worm to humans! She wrote her classic book Silent Spring in 1962 to explain this to the general public, to explain how humans and nature are interdependent. The title of Silent Spring refers to the fact that one day all the birds might be dead so they won’t be able to sing in the springtime. The agricultural and chemical industries reacted very badly to the book and said she was unprofessional. But further research by other scientists proved that she was right about the dangers of chemicals used to kill insects. Nowadays there is a growing movement for organic food production, but unfortunately things in general are still getting worse, rather than better. We still need to read Rachel Carson’s book and think about its message. D (Girl 2):
 	My choice of hero isn’t very original, I’m afraid, but he’s the person I would most like to have met: John Lennon. He died a long time before I was born, and his most famous songs were written long before that, but when I listen to his music I really feel as if he’s speaking to me personally. I love the whole range of the Beatles’ music, from the early pop songs to the very experimental music at the end of their time as a group. John Lennon was the most innovative writer in the Beatles and he continued to create exciting music when he left and went solo. But although I love his music, what I admire about him is his dedication to universal peace. It’s amazing that the song Imagine, written in 1971, is still incredibly popular after all this time. It’s about a world where everyone can be equal, a world with no wars, no divisions between countries, no greed, no hunger, no material possessions ...  I’d like to meet him because he was a lifelong rebel, and although he could be a difficult person, he was original, clever and funny. It was awful that he was killed in 1980 when he was only 40. I wonder what he would be doing if he was alive now.

"Hello. I’m going to talk about British festivals. 
I’m sure you’ve heard about the Notting Hill Carnival in London and the Edinburgh Festival, but today we’re going to look at a lot more that you might not know about. 
Actually, a lot of these are not exactly festivals, but strange races or competitions. 
Some of them are ancient and some are modern. So, let’s start in January in the north of Scotland with the Burning of the Clavie. 
This is a whisky barrel which is set alight then carried through the streets as a bonfire. 
It’s an ancient tradition which always takes place on 11th of January, the first day of the year, according to an older form of the calendar. The bonfire brings good luck for the coming year and people used to keep bits of burnt wood as protection against evil spirits. At the end of January, even further north, in the Shetland Islands, there’s another fire festival, the Up Helly Aa. This seems like an ancient festival, but has actually only been going for about 130 years – well, it is fairly old, I suppose. People carry fire-lit torches and a Viking boat through the streets, then set fire to the boat. There’s lots of dancing; it’s good fun. Now to the north of England. On Shrove Tuesday in February, otherwise known as Pancake Day, a special Pancake Bell is rung in Scarborough. Everyone goes down to the road next to the beach where they skip – yep, they jump over long ropes, up to fifteen people to one rope. And they have pancake races. This is quite common in the UK – running with a frying pan and tossing a pancake at the same time. Another kind of race takes place in spring – cheese rolling. In Gloucestershire, in the south-west of England, round cheeses in round boxes are sent rolling down a hill and people run after them and try and catch them. The hill is very steep, so people often fall over – if you take part in this you need to be very fit and wear your oldest jeans. Nowadays this strange custom attracts visitors from all over the world, but the people from the local village are usually the ones who catch the cheese. From people-racing, to animals, very tiny animals. World Championship Snail Racing takes place in a village in Norfolk. The snails have to race from an inner circle to an outer circle and the winner gets a lot of lettuce. There’s a party and barbecue for the snail owners and observers. This custom began in the 1960s after a local man saw something similar in France. In the UK we don’t eat snails, by the way. More fun, in my opinion, are the onion-eating contest, also in Gloucestershire – a race to finish eating a raw onion – and the Black Pudding Throwing Championship, in Lancashire. Black puddings are like big sausages made mainly from dried blood. Contestants bowl three black puddings each at 21 Yorkshire puddings set on a six-metre platform; the winner is the one who knocks down the most. Another fun contest takes place in September at the Egremont Crab Fair in Cumbria in the north of England. The World Gurning Championship is a competition to pull the ugliest face. It sounds ridiculous but this is an ancient British tradition and the Crab Fair itself dates back to 1267. The man who won the title of best gurner the most in recent years had all his teeth taken out so he could make terrible faces more easily. Finally, let’s go back to the south of England. In Brighton there’s a Burning the Clocks Festival to celebrate the winter solstice on December 21st. This custom started twenty years ago and is very popular. People make clock lanterns and time-themed figures of paper and wood, then walk through the town to the beach where the sculptures are set on fire and there’s a massive firework display. So, that’s just a taste of a few of our old and more modern traditions. Would you like to take part in any of them?

"Good morning. 
Today I’m going to talk about how to study. Now you probably think you know all about that, right? You’ve been studying for years. And I expect some of you are fantastic at studying, really organised and good at concentrating. But there’s always room for improvement, and your exams aren’t far away, so these tips are for all of you. Right, so, what’s the best way to study? Well, first of all, it’s a good idea to have some kind of plan or timetable. This could be for the week or a longer revision timetable for an exam, from one month to six months. Yes, if you’re studying for an important exam it’s important to think long term. Draw up a timetable, but revise it often. If it’s not going to plan, you may have to rethink it. Next, think about your environment. Make sure the place where you are going to study is comfortable with enough light, air, etc. Not too hot, not too cold. Make sure there are no distracting noises around, such as television. If you think you concentrate better listening to music, experiment and see if it’s really true. Some people really do seem to work better with music in the background, especially classical music, but for many people it spoils their concentration. However, if you have to work near a TV, you might have to use headphones to play music to drown out the sound of the TV. In this case, find out what kind of music works best for you, maybe something without words. By the way, you might think you work fine with the TV on, but, again, experiment. You might be surprised at how much better you work away from a TV. Oh, and the other thing is the internet, text messages, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Forget about all of that while you’re studying. No, really, you can ignore it for an hour or so; it won’t be the end of the world if you don’t reply to a message immediately. Right, planning breaks. Plan your study periods in chunks with regular breaks. Many people recommend half an hour of concentrated study, then a ten-minute break. But you can adjust this to suit you. If you study for too long at a stretch your mind will work less effectively, so be careful. In your short break, you can give yourself a treat, such as a cup of green tea. I wouldn’t advise a chocolate bar as a treat – a sugar rush is not great for concentration. OK, so next let’s think about what you do when you’re studying. Some people just read through their notes or textbooks and underline in pencil or highlight important bits. If this works for you, fine, but I’d suggest that it’s better to write notes of some kind, so your mind is processing the information more. This way you are also producing material which will be useful for last-minute revision. I don’t recommend very last-minute revision, by the way, but we’ll come back to that later. Have a look at these examples of student notes. Which do you think are best? The first person has written important phrases at random, the next has a table with clear headings and boxes with notes, the next has summaries, and the last one has mind maps: you’ve got the main topic in the circle, then lines coming off the circle attached to subcategories, then more lines to further details. Mind maps are great for showing the connections between different bits of information. They seem to work in the same way the brain works. So what do you think? To me, the first one wouldn’t be very useful to come back to and use in the future. But the others are all fine – it depends on your personal preference. Mine is for mind maps. I would suggest using colours, though, and even little drawings. They can make things much more memorable. Obviously, when you are studying, the first thing to think about is whether you understand the information, and the second thing is how you are going to remember it. Let’s look at some more ways of making information more memorable …"
"Presenter: The internet is full of articles about what makes a good boy band. But many bands appear and disappear without a trace. Alana, it can’t be as easy as following a formula, can it?
Alana: No, I don’t think so. The traditional formula is that you have four or five good-looking young guys with some musical ability and the ability to dance – the choreographed dancing was very important to boy bands in the past. They tended to wear the same, or very similar clothes when they performed, so you had to decide on a ‘look’ for the group. The most important element, however, was said to be that the band members had different and very distinct personalities.
Presenter: Right, the cute one, the rebel, the joker, the shy one, mysterious one ...
Alana: Yeah, although sometimes they all just seem to like the cute one! The idea is that different boys appeal to different girls, so you can have a bigger fan base. There’s someone in the band for everyone.
Presenter: So, do you think this all still holds true? Or have things changed in the 21st century?
Alana: Yeah, I guess things have changed for several reasons – partly just because we needed a change – but mainly because of changes in the media and with new technology. Take One Direction …
Presenter: Ah, I’ve been counting the seconds before you mentioned One Direction!
Alana: Well, we have to talk about them because they’re the biggest thing at the moment, although who knows how long they will last.
Presenter: Oh, ages and ages ...
Alana: We’ll see. Anyway, One Direction, as you know, came to fame through the X Factor, a reality show, and that was a great way to start. You had loads of people watching them every week and wanting them to win. They felt as if they had a personal stake in their story as they voted for them every week.
Presenter: What age group does One Direction appeal to exactly?
Alana: That’s another clever thing, they seem very unthreatening, so they appeal to very young girls, they are cute so teenage girls really like them, but they also have a laddish, slightly naughty side to appeal to the mums! The teenage girls and the mums are the ones who will spend money. The lyrics to the songs are calculated to appeal to girls who feel a bit insecure about themselves, like most teenage girls.""You don't know you're beautiful, that's what makes you beautiful"", that kind of thing. Lots of girls want to feel wanted, but not scared, and that’s traditionally what boy bands do. They present this image of a clean-cut, reliable boyfriend. Actually, One Direction’s clothes also help here: chinos and clean casual shirts and canvas shoes. You’ll have noticed that they don’t wear the same clothes. Their stylists have been instructed to keep them looking individual, but despite that they all have this attractive but unthreatening look. No tattoos, or piercings, or black leather, or make-up or anything.
Presenter: You make them seem very cold and calculating. Remember that  they’ve been nominated for loads of music awards and they’ve won dozens, so they’re regarded as serious musicians.
Alana: OK, if you don’t want to believe they’re calculating you can blame their management. They’re nice boys who are fantastic musicians.
Presenter: They are! And they keep proving their critics wrong. A lot of people said they wouldn’t make the leap from the UK to the US market, but they did very quickly.
Alana: Yes, and that’s all down to their clever use of social media, or rather their management’s clever use of social media. One Direction are all over Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr. That’s how they made it in the States so quickly. In the past it was a lot more difficult and took a lot longer. Bands had to try and get air-time on local radio stations and that was really hard. But they’ve by-passed all that. Social media has become the new radio, as their manager said.
Presenter: Their first record, Up All Night, went to number one in the US, didn’t it?
Alana: Sure did! They achieved a world record as the first British band in history to reach number one in America with a debut album. It sold 176,000 copies in the US in a single week.
Presenter: Amazing. And the boys are all rich from the merchandising too.
Alana: Yes, well, the boys and their management company. There are One Direction phones, toys and games. Dolls, even. I think that’s another 21st-century thing – companies are cashing in on success in all possible ways as quickly as possible.
Presenter: May they all enjoy it while it lasts."
"Presenter: Next on the programme we have an interview with someone who has been writing a book about high-achieving teenagers. Welcome, Louise Hardy.
Louise: Hi, it’s lovely to be here.
Presenter: Louise, many of these teenagers who have achieved success and fame early on, have done so through using new technology, haven’t they? Through blogging or using YouTube or Twitter?
Louise: Absolutely, and the greatest example of this is Justin Bieber.  As I think everyone on the planet knows, he started off by posting videos on YouTube at the age of 14 and was spotted by a talent scout who worked with the R&B singer Usher. After that he very rapidly became a worldwide sensation.
Presenter: I heard that last year he was said to be more influential than Obama!
Louise: (laughs) Yes, that was because he is number one on Twitter. He has over 35 million followers. There’s a new one every two seconds. A company that analyses social media called Klout said that he is the most influential person in the world because of that. But whether he’s really more influential than Obama, well …
Presenter: Mmmm. All this exposure has negative consequences for young people too, doesn’t it?
Louise: Yes. Although millions adore Justin, a lot of people don’t. One of his videos was the most disliked ever. And he has a big problem with privacy. He’s followed everywhere by the paparazzi, and that’s bad for anyone, never mind a teenager.
Presenter: OK, let’s turn to a very different teenager. Tavi Gevinson was even younger when she began, wasn’t she?
Louise: Yes, she was only eleven years old when she started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. By the way, for British listeners, “Rookie” is an American word used for a person who is new to something.
Presenter: Thanks.
Louise: On her blog she posted photos of herself wearing unusual combinations of clothes and wrote about them.
Presenter: Some of them were quite weird.
Louise: Well, yes, I suppose a lot of high fashion is weird. Anyway, she quickly built up a huge following, up to 300,000 readers per day, and many of them were adults. Serious fashion magazines interviewed her and sent her to fashion shows in Europe and to meet top designers, like Karl Lagerfeld.
Presenter: Some people didn’t believe she was as young as she was, did they?
Louise: No, one magazine printed an article saying the writer didn’t believe Tavi was only 12, and that upset her. But she bounced back and continued blogging. Then, as she grew older, Tavi became interested in other things besides fashion. In 2011, when she was 15, she started Rookie Magazine, an online magazine for teenagers. In less than a week it had one million readers.
Presenter: I’ve seen it. It’s very impressive, isn’t it? All teenage girls listening, check out Rookie Magazine.
Louise: Yes, I think it’s fantastic and Lady Gaga called Tavi “the future of journalism”! She employs about 50 writers and photographers – both adults and teenagers – on Rookie, but she is the editor with overall control.
Presenter: And all this time she’s continued to lead a normal life, hasn’t she?
Louise: Oh yes, she lives a very normal life in a small town and goes to school and so on. She’s not even twenty yet. But I think writing and editing are very different from being a performing artist. There’s a lot less pressure from fans and the press. Although some actors, like Emma Watson, seem to manage a private life and getting a normal education.
Presenter: Yes, Emma Watson is now in her twenties, of course, but …"
"Once again the organisation which promotes Australia, Tourism Australia, is advertising the best job in the world. But this year, they have six jobs going, all for six months, with a great salary and extra spending money. If you think one of these is your dream job, you have to make a 30-second video explaining why you are the best person for the role. But – be warned. Thousands of people will be competing for each post.
  The job of “outback adventurer” is for someone with a passion for outdoor life, and in the Northern Territory there are plenty of wide-open spaces. The job is for someone to find out the best adventures and jobs for young people on working holidays. You’d be getting close to wildlife, sleeping under the stars in a bush camp and flying over stunningly beautiful landscape in a hot air balloon. Your duties will include getting to know about aboriginal culture and eating traditional bushfoods, maybe including the famous witchetty grubs – insect larva.
  Like the idea of 200 days of sunshine every year? Job number two is a park ranger in tropical Queensland. It’s a wonderful state with ancient rainforests, the world’s largest sand island and the awesome Great Barrier Reef. Here your duties would include protecting and promoting native plants and animals, spectacular waterfalls, dinosaur fossils, untouched beaches and indigenous culture. You’d get paid to patrol the beaches of Lizard Island and live a life most people can only dream about.
  Another island job is as 'wildlife caretaker' on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. If you love all kinds of animals, this is the job for you. The advert says you’ll be able to talk to wallabies (a kind of small kangaroo), play with dolphins, cuddle koalas and sunbathe with seals on the unspoilt beach at Seal Bay. You would get about the island on foot, by bicycle, kayak or boat, taking photos and leaving only footprints. There is one potential drawback, though. You’d need to be pretty brave since you might come face to face with great white sharks.
  Maybe you are not quite so keen on the great outdoors and your talents are more journalistic. If you fancy feature writing, photography and making videos, you can apply for the position of lifestyle photojournalist for Time Out in Melbourne. You would be required to photograph and write about the city's coolest cafés and musical events. But you’d also cover tourist activities in the whole state of Victoria, including surfing on the Great Ocean Road, skiing at Mount Hotham or watching the little penguins at Phillip Island.
  Are you a foodie? Do you know about food, as well as love eating it? If the answer’s yes, you can apply for the role of ‘taste master’ in Western Australia. Your job would be to promote the best restaurants, pubs, wineries and breweries. You’d also catch fresh seafood off the beautiful coast and learn all about making wine and beer.
  Finally, a fantastic job in Sydney. We’ve all seen those amazing firework displays in Sydney Harbour. Well, you could be one of the people making that happen next year.  New South Wales is looking for a ‘chief funster’, who would be based in Sydney while travelling around the state and tweeting about the coolest things going on. This job would appeal to someone interested in everything: sports, the arts, entertainment, food. You’d also be involved in making the Sydney Festival, Mardi Gras and Vivid Festival as spectacular, and as fun, as possible."
"Presenter: Now the 2020 Olympics might seem a long way away to you, but people are already talking about what new sports might be included. Today I’m going to talk to two people who are hoping their sport might be included. The first is Jonny Mills whose sport is wakeboarding. Jonny, can you tell us what wakeboarding is? Is it like surfboarding?
Jonny: Well, a bit. It started in California because people wanted to surf but didn’t have waves ... It’s also a bit like waterskiing in that the rider is towed behind a specially-built speed boat.
Presenter: How fast does the boat go?
Jonny: Usually at about 25 mph, or a bit less. The rider uses the wake the board produces in the water to launch into the air.
Presenter: And then you do a lot of complicated things in the air?
Jonny: That’s right, spins of up to 1260 degrees, things like that.
Presenter: 1260 degrees, that’s impossible isn’t it?
Jonny: Oh no, but it’s pretty crazy. You spin round three and a half times in the air.
Presenter: And then you have to land again without falling over.
Jonny: You’ll have to come and watch some wakeboarding if you haven’t seen any. Come to Wakestock in July if you can.
Presenter: That’s in Wales, isn’t it?
Jonny: Yep, Abersoch in North Wales. It’s a really popular wakeboarding and music festival. It’s right by the beach. It’s not quite the same as California, but it’s cool. It attracts a lot of great riders.
Presenter: Who does wakeboarding?
Jonny: They reckon about 3 million people all over the world. More guys do it, but there are increasing numbers of girls too. The people who compete are usually in their teens or twenties, but anyone can do it. There’s a lot of crossover with other board sports like surfing and skateboarding. The tricks people pull are similar and the names for things are often the same.
Presenter: And looking at you, I’d say the fashion was similar too.
Jonny: Yeah, the clothes and the lifestyle are similar.
Presenter: Right, now I’d like to ask Jules Russell about her sport. She’s a skater in a roller derby team. Tell us about that, Jules. Is it a popular sport?
Jules: Yes, it’s becoming really popular in the UK. There are about 60 leagues in England and 1,200 throughout the world. In the US and Canada, of course, and places like Scandinavia and Australia, but lots of other countries too.
Presenter: The sport began in the States, didn’t it?
Jules: Yes, in the 1930s, but it was more for entertainment than sport and it died out by the 1970s. Then there was a revival in Texas in 2001 and from then on it’s just been growing and growing.
Presenter: So how do you play it?
Jules: Well, you have two teams of five people on roller skates, of course, and they go round an oval track in the same direction. Each team has a ""jammer"" who scores points by passing members of the opposing team. They do whatever they can to stop her, within reason. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.
Presenter: It sounds a bit rough!
Jules: Well, it’s a contact sport, so there’s bound to be a lot of pushing and falling over. It’s all good fun, though; people don’t often get hurt. If you try and trip someone up you get penalised. You do try and frighten the other team a bit though.
Presenter: That’s right. You have frightening clothes and special names.
Jules: People used to have incredible costumes a couple of years ago. Now the sport is changing and becoming more professional. Lots of the teams train three or four times a week, and spend a lot of time in the gym you have to be really dedicated and fit. We still have nicknames, though. I’m “The Julifier”.
Presenter: And is the sport all female?
Jules: There are a few men who do it, but it’s mostly female and amateur at the moment. Things are changing fast though, so who knows what the future will bring. It would be fantastic to be an Olympic sport.
Presenter: What do you think about roller derby, Jonny?
Jonny: It’s wild! Those ladies scare me to death! Good luck to them with the Olympics thing though. And good luck to us too.
Presenter: Good luck to you both."
"Presenter: Welcome to ‘Tech-Today!’ This week it’s National Science & Engineering Week, so to celebrate we asked Jed our science correspondent to give us a round-up of new inventions.

Jed: Hi, yes, I’ve got some very interesting things to tell you about today, starting with a fun one. Wing-suits, those suits that look like bats and allow people to fly, or glide, at least. They’re the ultimate in cool.
Presenter: But, they’re not very new, are they?
Jed: Well, no, but the modern ones are better than ever and last October was the first ever world championship in China. The price is coming down, too. Now you can buy one for 600 to 2,000 dollars. It’s still too expensive for me, but I suppose it’ll keep coming down.
Presenter: OK, what about useful new inventions?
Jed: There are lots of those. There’s a new solar water distiller created by Gabriele Diamanti aimed at parts of the world where it’s hard to get clean drinking water. You pour in salty water and let the sun do the work for a few hours. Then, hey presto! You have clean water! It’s a very simple device and fairly cheap to produce.
Presenter: Can I hear some doubt in your voice?
Jed: Well, they still need help with investment to start producing the distiller properly. So if anyone out there has money to invest in a great product …?
Presenter: Absolutely. Get in touch with the designers.
Jed: Another useful invention which it would be good to see in production are “enable talk gloves”. These were invented by some Ukrainian students to allow people with speech and hearing impairments to communicate with people who don’t understand sign language. The gloves use sensors to translate sign language into text, then into spoken language using a smartphone. A brilliant invention!
Presenter: Yes, that could benefit thousands of people.
Jed: Another useful invention comes from a surprising source, James Cameron, the film director.
Presenter: The 'Titanic' director?
Jed: The very same. Cameron was part of a team, headed by engineer Ron Allum, which designed the Deepsea Challenger Submarine, capable of descending to the lowest parts of the sea, 10 km down. Last year Cameron went down to the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the sea in the world. He was the first person to do a solo dive there, and he stayed for three hours, the longest time so far.
Presenter: That sounds impressive!
Jed: Yes. We know so little about what’s at the bottom of the ocean, and it’s important to find out more. OK, so now for something useful in a different way. You know that feeling when you’re trying to get tomato ketchup out of a bottle and it won’t come out, but you’re sure there’s lots more in there?
Presenter: Yeah, of course. It’s really annoying.
Jed: Well, a team of students at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have come up with a new product that you use to coat a glass or plastic bottle, and then what’s inside, hair gel or mustard, or whatever, comes out really easily.
Presenter: So, it saves hours of frustration trying to get stuff out of bottles?
Jed: Exactly. Right, now for my favourite invention. This is really silly, but I love it. It’s a way of producing clouds indoors.
Presenter: Clouds?
Jed: Yes. A Dutch artist has come up with a way of forming perfect, small, white clouds inside. They’re just beautiful. I don’t think you can do it yourself at home yet, though.
Presenter: I don’t think I’d want to.
Jed: Oh, you would if you’d seen the photos. They’re amazing.
Presenter: OK, Jed, thanks for that. We’ll leave you with your head in the clouds and see you again next week!"
"A: Hey, I’m reading this really interesting article about the human body.
B: Yeah? Well, we know all about that from biology lessons.
A: No, we didn’t learn much at all at school! They’re discovering loads more things all the time. Really amazing things! Did you know that only about one tenth of the cells in your body are really you? The rest are bacteria.
B: What? I’m not really me?
A: No, of course you are you, but you also have millions, or trillions, of bacteria in you.
B: Eeeeuuugh!
A: No, they’re mostly really helpful. Someone did an experiment to see if animals can live without bacteria, and he found that a lot of them died or had to have a special diet. Animals need bacteria to digest food, you see. So we’re better off with bacteria.
B: Unless the bacteria are bad.
A: Unless they are bad, but they’re nearly all good. Oh yeah, and going back to cells, do you know how many cells you have in your body?
B: Quite a lot, I’d say. A good few.
A: Yeah, but how many?
B: I don’t know. I’m not mathematical.
A: 7 octillion! That’s 7 plus 27 noughts.
B: I knew it was a lot.
A: OK, that’s an amazingly huge number, almost impossible to imagine. But the really weird thing is that most of the atoms are empty space, just air or nothingness. And if you took out the empty space, you could fit your body inside a tiny cube which measures one 500th of a centimetre on either side. That’s a box measuring  0.002 of a centimetre on each side. You’d be much too small to see.
B: Mmm, I can imagine that. It sounds like something that would happen in a really bad Hollywood movie. You know, a mad scientist goes:(funny voice) ‘I’m going to extract all the air from your body’. OK, enough facts for one day.
A: Don’t go! One last thing, did you know …
B: No.
A: Did you know that you probably have mites in your eyelashes?
B: Mites in my eyelashes? What are mites exactly anyway?
A: Yeah, they’re very small creatures, like insects, only not insects. They’re about a third of a millimetre long, so you can’t really see them. These particular mites live in eyelashes and eyebrows.
B: But in mine?
A: Well, maybe not. Only about 50% of people have them, and more older people. So you might not have any. Anyway, they’re completely harmless, they just eat dead skin.
B: Yeah, right, harmless. I really would have preferred not to know that.
A: Sorry.
B: I mean, really!"

  She lives next door and she’s always been really important in my life. When we were little and my mum was working she used to look after us. She’d tell us stories about her childhood. It was like listening to fairy stories, life was so different when she was a child. In her kitchen she used to keep a special dish with sweets for us, and she was always baking cakes and pies. Now she doesn’t bake so much. She’s started eating more healthily in her old age, salads and vegetables and things. It’s funny how she’s changed. She also goes to this special gym class for old people, it’s amazing. I don’t see her so often now, but she’s always the same person however much her lifestyle changes. 

B (Boy)
  He’s four years older than me and that seemed like a huge amount when we were children. When we were at the same school we’d never talk to each other during school hours. But now we’re older it’s a lot better, although I’ll always be the little one, and that’s annoying sometimes. He’s taken me to rock concerts that I wouldn’t have gone to otherwise and when he was at uni I went to stay with him sometimes. That was really cool. It was great to see what real student life was like when I was still at school. Now that he’s working he’s really busy, but we still hang out sometimes. We go to football matches together because we both support our home team. It’s always good to see him. 

C (Girl)
  We’ve known each other since we were five and we’ve always got on really well. Well, apart from that time when we fell out because we both liked the same boy. But he went off with Heather Jenkins, so we made friends again quite quickly! We both like the same kind of music and going dancing at the weekend, and when we were younger we went out on our bikes together. At school we’re good at different things. I’m good at languages and Laura’s good at maths. That’s good though – it means that we can help each other with our homework. Next year I’m probably going to study in London and she’s going to Manchester, but I’m sure our relationship won’t change. 

D (Boy)
  His family moved in just a few houses down from us when I was about ten, and I still remember how excited I felt when I found out there was another boy on the street. I’d been the only boy, you see. The others were all girls. We were good friends from the beginning because we were into the same things: computers and football, mostly. But we had quite a few of the same hobbies for a while. I remember making lots of models of aeroplanes one year. Another year we took up fishing. We had all the equipment and everything and we’d spend ages down by the river. I never go fishing now. His family moved away a couple of years ago. We’re still friends on Facebook but we don’t really have much contact. 

E (Girl)
  I can remember all the details of when we met. I was wearing a red dress and I’d just had my hair cut. I can even remember what music was playing the first time I saw him. I knew he was special from the beginning, and I was right. We’ve been together ever since. Well, it’s only been eighteen months, and some people say that isn’t very long, but it seems like ages to me. We’ve got such similar personalities and so much in common. I’m sure we’ll stay together forever."

 	My favourite thing has to be my new tablet. It’s really light and quite small, so I take it with me everywhere. I’m always writing messages to friends and it’s big enough to do college work on it too. It takes really good photos, and I play games and listen to music on it as well, of course. I often download films onto it and watch them in bed. My mum says I’m addicted, because I’m always on it. I even read things on it at breakfast time. I’m not allowed to at dinner time, though. I have to be polite and talk to people then.“Welcome back to real life,"" my mum says. B (girl)
 	My favourite thing? Does my cat count as a thing? She’s not really a thing, but anyway. She’s a really beautiful little cat. I’ve had her since she was four months old. You know how some cats are really independent and hardly talk to you? I know cats don’t really talk, but you know what I mean. Well, she’s not like that at all. She’s really affectionate and comes up to me as soon as I get home, purring away like mad. She makes a lot of noise for a tiny thing. She loves being stroked and comes and curls up next to me when I’m on the sofa. She’s great company. C (boy)
 	My new scooter! It’s quite small, but fun, and just what I needed for getting around the city. I used to have quite a long walk to the metro, then a longish walk at the other end to get to college. But now I can just whiz there on my scooter. And there’s no problem parking, there’s always space for it. You have to be careful with the cars and lorries – they don’t always see you – and when it rains the surface of the road is terrible, it gets really slippery. But in general it’s perfect for me, and I can fit a friend on the back too – I’ve got an extra helmet for a friend. It’s great. Riding along makes me feel so free. D (girl)
 	This might sound a bit old-fashioned, but my sewing machine is my favourite thing. I’m studying fashion and love making things, as well as designing them. I also love clothes myself and often buy second-hand clothes –  everyone loves the “vintage” look at the moment – and then I adapt them to my size. It’s much easier using a machine to do that than doing it by hand. I do alterations for my mum and my sister too. If I don’t make it as a designer, I suppose I can always set up my own alterations and customising business. Customising clothes, by taking things off and adding things on, is actually very creative, so I wouldn’t mind that. E (boy)
 	My set of Japanese knives. That sounds a bit sinister, doesn’t it, but I’m not a murderer or anything. They’re chef’s knives and the best ones come from Japan. Cooking is my new hobby. I got into it when I started watching Masterchef on TV. Then I went to an evening class for beginners, and I haven’t looked back since. I try and have a dinner for between four and eight friends every two or three weeks. That gives me something to work towards and I always do new dishes so they can try them out and give me feedback. It’s quite an expensive hobby if you use good ingredients, but now my friends help towards the cost. They still get a good meal for a very low price."

  Hi, come in. I’m Maya. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Grange Park Sports Centre. I’ll just show you round the centre and explain what we offer here, and then you can ask me questions. Well, as you can see, this is quite a small centre but we offer a lot of different activities at different times of the day. If you’d just like to come through here, you can see the main rooms. These are nice and light and airy and we have a very good air-conditioning system so they are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Here we have classes of yoga, tai chi, Pilates and Zumba at different levels. We also have different types of dance class: jazz dancing, Indian dancing and Latin dancing. Oh, and we’ve just started offering flamenco. All our teachers are fully qualified and experienced. We have beginners’ classes up to advanced. Some of our students have been coming since we opened, ten years ago.
  So, if you could follow me through here - mind the steps here - we’ve got the sauna and massage rooms. We have very reasonable prices for massages. And over here we have the gym with exercise machines. It’s quite a small gym, but usually there’s plenty of room for people to move around without any problems. OK, that’s about it. Over there we have the changing rooms with showers. You do need to bring your own towel if you want a shower, but you don’t need to bring a mat for the yoga and Pilates classes. Oh, and I must mention the café. It’s just off the main entrance. That’s very popular with our clients; we have a great selection of teas, fresh juices, sandwiches and cakes.
  Right, the prices. You can join for three months, six months or a year and that gives you the right to use the gym and go to two classes a week. If you want to go to more classes or use the sauna, there’s a small extra charge. For three months the fee is …

B
  OK, let me show you the gym. My name’s Bill and I’m the main sports trainer here, but we have a team of four specialists who are always around to help you with exercise programmes and give advice about lifestyle and diet. We strongly recommend that you talk to one of us as soon as you sign up and set up your personalised training programme. So, through here we have the main gym. As you can see, it’s enormous and we have lots of brand-new machines. You can do everything here, running, cycling, rowing, weights … you name it. Although we have a lot of clients, it’s very unusual to have to wait for a machine. Over there is the area for weight-training. If you want a closer look at the machines, you can come back later. Oh, by the way, you can only come in here with trainers on. No outdoor shoes, please.
  OK, through here we have the swimming pool. It’s great, isn’t it? We’re very proud of it. You can use it most of the time without booking, but there are certain times of day when we have swimming classes and water aerobics. There is always a lifeguard in attendance who will also offer informal swimming tips. OK, just over there you have the changing rooms and lockers, and on the right are the bathrooms and showers. We have our own shop, here, where you can buy our own brand of sportswear and sports drinks and supplements. Right, I can see you’re impressed, and as I said, we’re very proud of our centre. However, I should warn you that we are slightly more expensive than other gyms in the area – but then we offer a much higher level of services and a very wide range of activities. Here’s a brochure with the timetables of the extra classes that we offer, such as boxing, taekwondo and capoeira and quite a few others, besides swimming activities: swimming classes, diving classes, water aerobics and water polo. OK, so have a look at the brochure, then you can speak to one of the secretaries in reception about the best combination of activities for you."

 	I really like The Notebook; it’s a romantic classic. The story is about a poor boy, called Noah, who meets a rich girl, called Allie, and they fall in love over one summer. But of course there are problems. Allie’s parents don’t approve of Noah because he’s poor and they get separated, then a lot of time passes before they can get together again. She goes away to college and he writes to her every day, but she doesn’t get the letters. Then after quite a long time, Noah buys an old house which he promised to restore for Allie. He does it up and she sees a newspaper article about it and goes to find him again. You can probably guess the rest, but it’s a bit complicated because she is engaged to another man. Noah is played by Ryan Gosling, who’s my favourite actor, and he stops the film being too soppy – but you still cry a lot at the end. Rachel McAdams is really good too, as Allie. B (boy)
 	I think my favourite film is Skyfall, the last James Bond movie. It stars Daniel Craig again and Javier Bardem is this really evil baddie. They’re both great, and so is Judi Dench as M, Bond’s boss. It’s a bit different to other Bond films. The story is more important, although there is still a lot of action. It’s really well filmed, especially in the scenes which are shot in Shanghai and Scotland, and it’s really exciting, of course. Bond is also a bit different – although he does amazing things, he seems older and that makes him more human and the story more realistic. Oh, the song by Adele is great, too. You know it won an Oscar? C (girl)
 	It’s not a very recent film, but I love Pride and Prejudice – the version with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy. The story is really clever and interesting, besides being romantic. It’s all about how we tend to jump to conclusions about people and we’re often completely wrong. Elizabeth thinks Mr Darcy is stuck up and snobbish at the beginning of the film, but at the end she realises she has been completely wrong and he isn’t like that at all. She also realises he has an enormous house and that maybe helps her fall in love with him too! After I saw the film I read the book by Jane Austen and I really recommend that too. Although it was published 200 years ago, it’s still a great read and really funny in parts.

 	D (boy)
 	My favourite film has to be The Matrix. Even though it was made back in 1999, it still feels really modern. It’s about this ordinary man, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, who works with computers during the day and is a hacker at night. One day he is contacted by a woman who introduces him to a very strange man: Morpheus. Morpheus explains to Neo that what he thinks of as real is actually fiction and the world is run by evil machines who have imprisoned and tricked the human race. Laurence Fishburne is terrific as Morpheus, and Keanu Reeves is excellent, but the best thing about the film is the special effects. I can watch it again and again. E (girl)
 	Let the Right One In is my favourite film. There are two versions, the first is Swedish and the second American – I prefer the original, Swedish version. It’s a modern vampire film and also a kind of love story, but it’s really unsentimental and a bit scary in places. Oskar is a young boy with a lot of problems. He is being bullied at school and wants revenge on the bullies. Then some new neighbours move in next door and he becomes friends with Eli, a beautiful but strange girl. I won’t tell you any more, because it will spoil the story, but expect a serial killer, a lot of violence and blood-drinking. If you like that kind of thing, you’ll love this."
"Interviewer: Good morning. Today we’re going to talk about theme parks and we’re going to hear from Andy Wells who has written a guide to theme parks around the world. Welcome to the programme, Andy.
Andy: Hi, it’s good to be here.
Interviewer: You really have a dream job, don’t you, Andy? Flying round the world all the time, visiting adventure parks ...
Andy: Well, yes, it’s pretty exciting. But it’s really hard work too, you know.
Interviewer: I bet. So, what’s the number one theme park in the world?
Andy: That all depends what you’re looking for. In terms of numbers, it has to be Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, the most famous theme park. But the most popular park for people who like adventure rides is Cedar Point in Ohio, USA. It has the biggest number of rollercoasters in one park, 17, and three water rides. There are lots of other attractions too. Last year they introduced 50 animatronic dinosaurs. You know, life-size models that move and look real.
Interviewer: Cool! Have they got anything lined up for this year?
Andy: Yeah, there’s a new rollercoaster called the Gatekeeper. Well, actually it’s not a rollercoaster, it’s a wingcoaster. It’ll be the biggest in the world.
Interviewer: What’s a wingcoaster?
Andy: With a normal rollercoaster you are sitting on a seat with the track under you. With a wingcoaster the seats kind of stick out at the side so the passengers have nothing below or above them. You feel as if you’re flying.
Interviewer: So it’s more frightening?
Andy: More exciting! Way more exciting.
Interviewer: What other attractions have you seen recently?
Andy: I’ve just been to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at the Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. It’s great! You know those shops that sell magic sweets and things in the Harry Potter books? Well, they have those, just like you’ve imagined. There’s a fantastic tour of Hogwarts School where you meet characters from the books. It’s so well done.
Interviewer: Right, sounds interesting. In your book you have a lot of theme parks in Asia too. Can you tell us about them?
Andy: Sure. Tokyo has had a Disneyland for quite a long time, which attracts a lot of people. Ocean Park in Hong Kong has also been going for a long time – that has a lot of marine animals as well as rides. Lotte World, a huge park in South Korea, has the world’s biggest indoor theme park. And then there’s Universal Studios in Singapore. That’s expanding with additions to its New York street section. There’s going to be a Sesame Street dark ride. A dark ride’s a ride inside a building.
Interviewer: I see. New York in Singapore?
Andy: Yeah, it’s weird, but it works. But the place to watch at the moment is China – they’re really expanding. Lots more parks will open in China in the next few years, including another one with dinosaurs in the north, and Ocean Kingdom in the south. That will have the world’s longest roller coaster and tallest Ferris wheel, as well as boat rides and a night-time zoo.
Interviewer: Wow, so that’s opening soon?
Andy: Yes, this year. I’ll be there!
Interviewer: Have a ride for me, then."
"Zoo guide: OK, are we all together? Right, next we’re going to look at the llamas, but actually here we have four different animals which are all from South America and all related to camels. Llamas, which you have probably heard of, over here. And over there alpacas, vicuñas and guanacos.
  Llamas and alpacas are both domesticated animals and vicuñas and guanacos are wild. Llamas are the biggest animal – they can grow up to 1.8 metres tall and in the past they were used to carry things. Llamas are very sociable animals and live together in groups, in herds.
Teenager 1: Don’t they spit at people, though?
Guide: Well, yes, they can. All members of the camelid family sometimes spit. You don’t want to mistreat a llama; it might even spit some of the contents of its stomach at you.
Group of teenagers: Uuuugggh!
Guide: But if you treat them properly they are not likely to. They respond well to being trained and they are usually gentle and curious.
  OK, over here we have the alpacas. As you can see, they are smaller than the llamas. They’ve got smaller faces and they always look as though they are smiling. Look at this one’s face.
Group of teenagers: Aaaah!
Guide: The alpaca is famous for its wool, which is softer and warmer than sheep’s wool. There’s a big demand for alpaca wool from the fashion industry.
  Right, next to the alpacas we have the vicuñas. As I said before, these animals are wild and they are thought to be the ancestors of the alpacas. Vicuñas are very elegant and graceful creatures. Look at this one. She’s beautiful.
Group of teenagers: Mmmm. She’s lovely. (etc.)
Guide: Have you heard of the Incas? The ancient rulers of Latin America who lived in the Andes? Well, they wore clothes made from vicuña wool – only the royal family were allowed to wear the wool. It is even softer than alpaca wool but vicuñas can only be shorn of their wool every three years. For that reason the wool’s very expensive.
  And, lastly, we have the guanacos. They are similar to the vicuñas, but larger and stronger. They are capable of surviving at over 4,000 metres in the Andes. When they are in the desert they survive by licking the water off the cacti and other desert plants. Right, any questions?
Teenager 2: I think I can hear this llama making a noise.
Guide: Ah, yes. That could be the llama humming. They don’t open their mouths, they just make this strange noise. They hum when they are stressed, or the opposite, feeling relaxed.
Teenager 1: Can llamas live in the UK?
Guide: Yes, there are quite a lot of llamas and alpaca in the UK. They adapt very well to our climate. They make good pets and sometimes they’re used for trekking. You go on a picnic and use a llama to carry your food.
Teenager 3: Cool! I want to do that!
Guide: And sometimes farmers use them as guard dogs, I mean guard llama. The adult males will protect sheep and hens from animals that might attack them, like dogs or foxes. They’re really useful animals."
"Girl: So, have you got any plans for the weekend?
Boy: Yeah, me and my mates are going to this activity centre in the mountains.
Girl: Oh, yeah?
Boy: You can do all kinds of things. It’s a new centre; it sounds great. We’re going to go dirtboarding …
Girl: What’s that?
Boy: It’s like skateboarding or snowboarding. You have a board, or deck, to stand on and wheels. They’re pretty strong because you go down rough mountain tracks on them. Steep, rough mountain tracks.
Girl: Sounds a bit risky. Have you done it before?
Boy: No, but I’ve done similar things. Anyway, we’re also going to go canyoning. Before you ask, that’s when you jump and swim down a river canyon. You have to use ropes and special equipment. And maybe we’ll go white water rafting too.
Girl: Phew. It sounds far too difficult to me.
Boy: They have lots of things that you could do too. Like zip-wiring, you know when you go along a wire through the trees or down a mountain.
Girl: Go down a mountain on a wire!
Boy: It’s really easy, and exciting too. You just have to hold on and enjoy the ride. Or there’s bungee jumping.
Girl: Jump off a bridge on a long elastic band! Me? You’ve got to be joking! Anyway, I’m going away this weekend too, thank you for asking.
Boy: I was going to ask. So where are you going?
Girl: Paris! I’m so excited!
Boy: Paris, wow!
Girl: Yeah, it’ll be brilliant! We’re going to do all the sights, like go up the Eiffel Tower and take a boat along the River Seine and see the old parts of the city. It looks so beautiful in the photos. And then there are all the art galleries. You know how much I like art. I can’t wait to go round the Louvre and see all those famous paintings.
Boy: I think the famous Impressionist paintings are somewhere else.
Girl: Yeah, I know, they’re in the Musée d’Orsay. We’re going there too. And then I want to go to the Rodin Museum and see that famous statue, you know, The Thinker. And of course, if we’re in Paris, we’ll have to go shopping. Or look at the shops, at least. And then there’s the restaurants. Just think, French food!
Boy: You’ve got a lot planned for one weekend.
Girl: Oh, we’re going for four days, actually.
Boy: Oh, four days, very nice. And who are you going with?
Girl: Oh, just a friend."
"A
  It was Nicky’s idea, but we all think it’s going to be brilliant. As soon as the last exams have finished, we’re going to decorate the main hall at school with paper streamers and Chinese lanterns and things. Steve had this idea of projecting photos of everyone onto a wall, like a slide show. And we’ve got Jo’s brother, who’s a professional DJ, coming along. Then there are three different bands lined up to play. Ours is the best, because we’ve been together longest and we’ve got a great bass player, (coughs) although I say so myself, so we’re on last. It’s going to be cool. 

B
  Every year there’s a carnival in August in London. You’ve probably heard of it, the Notting Hill Carnival? So this year, me and my friends are going again. We went last year and we had such a fantastic time. It’s all Afro-Caribbean, with people in amazing costumes and these brilliant steel bands. We don’t go in costume, but we do dance a lot. It does get quite crowded, so you have to make sure you stick together. And you have to watch out for pick-pockets when there are so many people in the same place. But it’s really good fun; it’s like London becomes a different country. Even the police dance sometimes. 

C
  We’re going to hire a boat for the day and take it up the river. It’s my grandparents’ golden wedding anniversary, so the whole family is getting together. I’m really looking forward to seeing my cousins again. I haven’t seen them for ages. We’ve got this huge picnic planned, with loads of different types of sandwiches and salads and an enormous cake. My dad has borrowed an ancient gramophone player, you know, what they had before CD players, and some old records. So as we go up the river we’re going to listen to music from the time my grandparents got married – the swinging sixties! 

D
  Two of my best friends have their birthday in the same week, so some of us have decided to have a surprise party for both of them. One of my friends, Sandra, has a big house, and her parents say we can use it. They’re going away, luckily. It’s at the end of October, so we’re going to decorate the house with Halloween things, you know, spiders' webs and spooky things. We're going to make up an excuse to get the birthday girls to come round to the house – say we’re going to help Sandra move some stuff, or something. Then, as soon as Sandra lets them in, we’re going to turn the lights out and jump out at them! We just have to make sure nobody mentions anything on Facebook and gives away the surprise. 

E
  There’s a Royal Wedding in June – one of our princes is getting married – so it’s a public holiday. Lots of people are having parties in squares and parks and places, and the people in our street decided to have one too. Well, it’s a good excuse to have a party, isn’t it? We’re all going to take out tables and chairs and put them together in the middle of the road. We’re going to stop cars coming through, obviously. We’re all going to bring different dishes and share them round. There are quite a lot of different nationalities living on our street – people from India, China and different African countries – so the food should be really interesting. It’ll be good to get to know more of the neighbours too."

Boy: Mum?
Mother: Yes?
Boy: You know that Economics exam I had last week?
Mother: The one you didn’t revise for?
Boy: I did revise for it. I was working on it all weekend. Don’t you remember?
Mother: Oh, yes, I remember. Apart from going out until four in the morning, you mean?
Boy: Well, I have to relax a little, even if I’m revising. Anyway, I didn’t pass it.
Mother: You failed it! But wasn’t that an important one?
Boy: Yeah, I’m really sorry.
Mother: I’m really sorry too. What does that mean?
Boy: Well, I’ll probably have to retake the whole course.
Mother: Oh, Ryan! It’s a really expensive course. I’m not sure we can afford for you to take it again. Things are difficult enough as it is.
Boy: I know, Mum. I’m sorry. I’ll talk to the teacher again and see if I can retake it.

Girl 1: Hi, Megan. How are you?
Girl 2: Not feeling too good, actually.
Girl 1: Oh? Why’s that?
Girl 2: Well, something terrible happened this morning … (voice trembling)
Girl 1: What? Sorry, take your time, and tell me when you’re ready.
Girl 2: Well, I was playing with Bonzo in the garden with a ball, and the ball went over the hedge into the road, and …
Girl 1: Yes?
Girl 2: And Bonzo jumped over the hedge after it and he got hit by a car.
Girl 1: Oh, no! And is he … ?
Girl 2: Yes. We took him to the vet’s immediately, but there was nothing she could do.
Girl 1: Oh, poor Bonzo. And poor you. I know how much he meant to you.
Girl 2: We’d had him since he was a tiny puppy. He was like one of the family.
Girl 1: I’m really sorry. At least he had a happy life.
Girl 2: His life was too short!
Girl 1: Well, yes, OK. I’m sorry, that was a really insensitive thing to say. I’ll come round and see you later, OK?

Boy: Hi, Dad.
Father: Hi, how’s it going?
Boy: Did you have a good day at work?
Father: Same as usual, really. What about you? Good day at school?
Boy: Yeah, pretty good. Except for one little thing …
Father: Why do I have a sinking feeling in my stomach?
Boy: Do you remember you lent me your phone?
Father: Yes?
Boy: Well, I was standing just outside school, texting Jack, and somebody ran past and grabbed it.
Father: You let someone steal my phone?
Boy: I didn’t let them.
Father: No, I suppose not. But did you know that that might happen? Is that a dangerous spot?
Boy: Well, I had heard of that happening, but I’d forgotten. Anyway, I didn’t think it would happen to me.
Father: No, OK. Did you see who it was?
Boy: No. It was someone in a blue tracksuit, and there are loads of people who wear those. But there’s a CCTV camera on the entrance. It might have got a shot of the thief’s face.
Father: You reported it then?
Boy: Well, not yet, but I will tomorrow.
Father: All right. Don’t forget to report it tomorrow. I’ll have a look at the insurance and see if it’s covered."
"<strong>Josh</strong>: Hey, Shirley. You&rsquo;re from Australia, right?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. From <strong><i>Down Under</i></strong>.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay. Are you from Sydney?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: No. I&rsquo;m not from Sydney. Actually, I&rsquo;m from Melbourne.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Melbourne?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Hmm.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay. So are there any nice parts in Melbourne?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Well, you know Josh, Melbourne is a great city. And one of the reasons is because there are lots of parks. There&rsquo;s a really big park right in the center of the city.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Is it beautiful?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: It&rsquo;s <strong><i>gorgeous</i></strong>. It&rsquo;s called the Botanical Gardens. And they have plants from many different places around the world. And there&rsquo;s a lake, a small lake in the center. But what I really love about that park is at one time of the year, they have lots of big <strong><i>fruit bats</i></strong> that fly into the park and they hang <strong><i>upside down</i></strong> from the trees. They are really huge, like big sacks. It&rsquo;s very cool.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: That sounds beautiful.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: So is there good shopping in your city?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Oh, there&rsquo;s great shopping in Melbourne. You know, Melbourne has people from many different countries. So we have a great variety of things; and clothing, cars, coffee shops, foods from many different countries. So it&rsquo;s a great place to shop.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Wonderful. What about housing? Is there cheap housing or is it really expensive?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Well, it&rsquo;s not cheap but it&rsquo;s not as expensive as Sydney. Sydney is the biggest city in Australia. It&rsquo;s very expensive to live. But in Melbourne, hmm, the housing is so-so.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: How do you get around in Melbourne? Do you take the bus?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: You can take the bus but Melbourne has something very special that no other city in Australia has. We have a <strong><i>tram</i></strong> system. I think they&rsquo;re called trolley cars in America, maybe.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, that sounds familiar.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. Well, Melbourne has a really big tram system so you can go lots of places in the city by tram. It&rsquo;s really good fun.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: What about the tram? Is it expensive?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Not so expensive; cheaper than the bus. Maybe about the same as the train. Cheaper than a car. Probably, one of the cheapest ways to travel in the city.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: What about schools in Melbourne. Is there a big university?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Melbourne has three or four really big universities and some smaller universities, too. Also, they have some very good <strong><i>private</i></strong> high schools and some very good <strong><i>public</i></strong> high schools.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Great. That sounds like a great place to go to school.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: It&rsquo;s a pretty great place to live.<br />End of Transcript"

Those are hard. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: So what did you do on Saturday? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Well, Saturday morning, I usually clean the house. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. It’s kind of boring, but I have to clean the bathroom and then the kitchen, and then the lounge room because I have lots of cats. And the cats leave hair everywhere. So I always have to clean on Saturday mornings. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yes, cats are messy. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: So after you cleaned, what did you do? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Well, in the afternoon, I went for a walk up the mountain. It was a beautiful sunny day. There were no clouds in the sky. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Wow. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: It was gorgeous. So I walked up the mountain and I saw a <strong><i>ferret</i></strong>. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: A ferret? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Wow. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: They’re a little <strong><i>furry</i></strong> animal, four legs, tail—not like a rabbit, but about the same size as a rabbit. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: And they’re kind of gold brown color. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Wow, did you see any other animals on your walk? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: No. I didn’t see any other animals on the <strong><i>ground</i></strong>. But I did see a beautiful bird flying in the sky. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Wow. Do you know what kind? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: I think it was an <strong><i>ibis</i></strong>. It’s a big bird that usually walks in the water. It has long legs and it was white with a black head. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Great. So after your walk, did you do anything else? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: I went home and then I watched some TV. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: That was about it for my Saturday. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay. What did you do on Sunday? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Sunday, I went to the art museum. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Really? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Great. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: I really like to go and see new art; pictures or paintings or photographs or sometimes <strong><i>sculptures</i></strong>. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay. So who’s your favorite artist? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: I don’t really have a favorite artist but I really like watercolors, so pictures that are painted with just soft—a kind of soft painting style. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Do you like paintings of nature? <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: I do like paintings of nature. I especially like paintings of flowers and animals and places that have water like lakes or rivers or the sea. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Oh, that sounds like you had a great weekend. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah, it was good. Thanks. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay. <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                        "

So who is an artist that you like?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: My favorite artist at the moment is Jason Mraz.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. Where does he come from?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: He comes from the States, the US. He plays guitar and sings at the same time.<br><strong>Shirle</strong>y: <strong><i>Nice</i></strong>. So you like to sing, too.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, I like to sing, too.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Cool. Okay, do you play any other <strong><i>instruments</i></strong>?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: I do. I play the piano as well.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: <strong><i>Wow</i></strong>. You are really very talented.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Thank you.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: So when you play piano, do you like to sing as well?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: I don’t usually sing when I play piano because I’m not as good at the piano.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Oh, I see. So like guitar better than piano or you’re better at it?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: I’m <strong><i>better at</i></strong> guitar.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. Do you have a band?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: I don’t have a band, but I hope someday, I will.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Hmm, a rock band?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Maybe.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Do you have a name for your rock band?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: No, I haven’t really <strong><i>picked </i></strong>one up yet.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: What about Josh and the Jammers?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: That sounds okay, but it’s a little long.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. JJ’s Jammers.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: That’s a little better.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yes. In Australia, that sounds like <strong><i>pajamas</i></strong>.                                                                                "
"<strong>Shirley</strong>: So Josh, where do you come from? <br><strong>Josh</strong>: I come from Tacoma. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Tacoma. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: I’ve never heard of that. It’s in America, right. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yes, it’s in Washington State, really close to Seattle. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Oh, okay, Seattle. I’ve heard of that. Well, tell me about Tacoma. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Well, Tacoma is smaller than Seattle but it has many great things to do too. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. So give me some examples. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Well, there’s a great par right in the center and at that park, there’s a <strong><i>botanical garden</i></strong>.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Wow. So a little bit like Melbourne, in Australia. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, it is. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. What about shopping? <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Shopping? There’s really one place for the best shopping, and that’s the Tacoma Mall. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Mall. Hmm, what’s a mall? <br><strong>Josh</strong>: It’s a big indoor shopping center. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Oh, it’s all indoor. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Wow that must be a really big building. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: It’s <strong><i>huge</i></strong>. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. What kind of shops do they have there? <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Everything. They have lots of clothing shops, and they also have two sport shops and they have a <strong><i>food court</i></strong> where you can buy any kind of food you want. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Wow. Well, that sounds convenient. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: It is. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. Well, how about traveling around the city. What’s the public transport system like? <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Mostly, we travel by car. But there’s buses too. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. So not so much public transport. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Not really. The buses stop early in the evening. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. I see. What about sports because, you know, in Australia, we have lots of places to play to sport. We really like our sport. So what about Tacoma? Are there many places to play sport?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Mostly, we have parks that have <strong><i>baseball fields</i></strong> and <strong><i>tracks</i></strong>. And those are the best places. But as far as professional sports, you have to go to Seattle. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Oh, okay. What about <strong><i>tennis courts</i></strong>? <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Tennis courts, I think there’s one. But it’s really expensive. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Really? <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Really. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: You know, in Australia, we have lots of tennis courts everywhere. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: That must nice. I love tennis. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. It’s kind of fun. What about eating in Tacoma because it sounds like it’s a little bit of a small town, so is there any good place to go and eat food? <br><strong>Josh</strong>: That’s one strong point. There’s lots of restaurants. The best restaurant is actually near my house, and it’s a barbecue restaurant. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay, lucky for you. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah. <br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Tacoma sounds like a nice friendly place to live. <br><strong>Josh</strong>: It is. <br>"
"<strong>Josh</strong>: So, Shirley, I told you about my favorite restaurant. What is your favorite restaurant?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Well, my favorite restaurant is a kind of salad and soup restaurant.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay, that&rsquo;s my favorite.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Great! Well, the food is very good but I also like it because the room is nice, it looks on a garden and the food is very cheap.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Wow!<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: With a great view of a garden. It seems like it would be expensive.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah, it does seem like it would be expensive, but it&rsquo;s not. The garden has lots of beautiful flowers but also they grow herbs. So the <strong><i>herbs</i></strong> that they use in the salad are all fresh from the garden. It&rsquo;s delicious.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: That sounds really delicious.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah, it&rsquo;s great. And they make a fantastic soup.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Some cream soups, and also a really nice vegetable soup.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Great! So, is the vegetable soup your favorite dish at the restaurant?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Mmm, yes. In the wintertime, the <strong><i>minestrone</i></strong> soup is my favorite soup.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: I love minestrone soup.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah. It&rsquo;s excellent. But in the summertime, my favorite soup is cream of potato <strong><i>chilled</i></strong>.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Chilled?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: That means it&rsquo;s served cold.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay, that sounds amazing.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: It&rsquo;s really <strong><i>refreshing</i></strong> in the summertime.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: What are the prices at the restaurant?<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: It is so cheap. It&rsquo;s about nine dollars for a small bowl of soup, a big salad, and a sandwich that usually has some salad and seafood in it.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: That&rsquo;s really cheap.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Yeah.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: We should go there.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Plus, after all that, you get a coffee or herb tea.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: Wow, that&rsquo;s great!<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: I definitely recommend that you go there some time.<br /><strong>Josh</strong>: I&rsquo;ll try it out.<br /><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay!"
"                                            <strong>Shirley</strong>: Josh, I’m really hungry now. Do you know a good restaurant we could go to?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yes, there’s a really great chicken restaurant near my house.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Chicken?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah, they have lots of different types of chicken. They have fried chicken, baked chicken, <strong><i>broiled</i></strong> chicken, and <strong><i>so on</i></strong>.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Hmm, chicken. You know, I don’t really like chicken that much. Do you know about somewhere else, somewhere that doesn’t have chicken or beef?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yes, there’s a vegetarian restaurant near my house, too. But it’s in the opposite direction.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Great. Okay, what kind of food do they have?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: They have lots of salads, fresh salads. And they also have some <strong><i>stirfry</i></strong>.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay, and what’s the restaurant like?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: The restaurant is really nice. It’s pretty small, and there’s not a lot people usually.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. Is it light or dark inside the restaurant?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: It’s a little bit dark but the food is really good.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. What about the tables? Do they have tablecloths or do they not have tablecloths?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: There’s no <strong><i>tablecloths</i></strong> and the tables are a little bit low.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: What about the price of the food? Is it expensive or is it cheap?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: It’s very cheap.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Hmm, that’s good.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Yeah. For example, you can buy a salad for only 5 dollars.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Wow. That is cheap.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: It is.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. What about a soup?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: A soup is usually 6 dollars but they’re really good.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay. Well, I have my car today, so is there parking at the restaurant?<br><strong>Josh</strong>: There’s some parking but there’s actually a lot nearby.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Okay, so no problem to park my car.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: It’s no problem.<br><strong>Shirley</strong>: Great. Then, let’s go for <strong><i>vegetarian</i></strong>.<br><strong>Josh</strong>: Okay, <strong><i>sounds great</i></strong>.<br>"
"<strong>Heidi:</strong> Fall.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> In the fall? <br><strong>Heidi: </strong>Yes, because in the fall we have a celebration called Naadam and that’s the best time to go. And you get to see <strong><i>horse racing</i></strong> and <strong><i>archery</i></strong> and <strong><i>wrestling</i></strong> and so many tourist come to Mongolia at that time. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> Okay, now in your city, what is one food I should definitely try? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Well I would say khuushuur. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow. khuushuur? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yes. Everyone loves it. And for me, I love it too. It looks like <strong><i>dumpling</i></strong> but fried and it’s more bigger and inside is meat. <br><strong>Todd: </strong>So it’s like a dumpling and inside it’s meat. <br><strong>Heidi: </strong>Yes. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> So outside, the dumpling part, it is like bread or is it like...<br><strong>Heidi: </strong>It’s a flour, yeah.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> Like a flour-based... <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yes<br><strong>Todd:</strong> Okay, now Mongolia is quite famous for meat, correct? So, what is probably the most popular meat? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Beef. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> Beef?<br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> So not chicken, not fish...? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> We don’t really eat chicken and we don’t eat fish. Well, we have a river fish. It’s like really delicious but then we don’t have sea so seafood is not popular at all. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> So people mainly eat beef. <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yes. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> So when I’m there in your country, what place should I go to. Like, what should I see? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Probably, [it’s] better to go to the countryside because if you go to Ulan Bator it’s just the same as other cities -- other cities around the world. But the countryside is a whole different world. And the countryside is where you can see the Mongolian tent and horses, like, Nomadic places like where people live in the outside. That’s the best place for foreigners to go. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> Is there anything I should buy? Like, what would be a good souvenir or gift from your country? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Well, in the department stores they have sections for Mongolian traditional gifts and stuff so probably you can get the tent -- a small <strong><i>tent</i></strong>.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> A little tent?<br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yeah, and then if you open the door you can actually see all the furniture is inside it. So it’s kind of interesting. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow, like a little doll house? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> Okay, wow, it sounds good. I hope to go. <br><br>"
"<strong>Heidi:</strong> Oh sure. In Mongolia, we don’t have elementary school, secondary school, or high school divided into three parts, but we have from 1st grade until 12th grade in one school so we don’t really call them like high school or secondary school or elementary school. And for the high school, like, from the 8th grade until 12th grade, well, they study  what other students study in different countries but nowadays they are focusing on more, like, English studies or different language studies. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> How long is a <strong><i>typical</i></strong>class? Do you have, <strong><i>let’s say</i></strong>, six classes a day, each class is one hour? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> We start school at 8:00 in the morning until 1:00 in the [after] noon and we have about six classes a day. Each class has like 45 minutes. So we finish at 1:00. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> And then, what do you do in the afternoon? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> We go back.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> You go home?<br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yes, ‘cause in Mongolia we have two parts. In the morning, the high school students go to the school and from 1:30 the elementary school students go to the school so we share one class [between] two classes. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, so you <strong><i>split</i></strong> the school?<br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yes. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> So do teachers sometimes have to teach both levels? <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow! That’s tough. <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> So when you go home, do you usually...do have family there waiting or do usually both parents work?<br><strong>Heidi:</strong> In Mongolia, the mother and father they usually work and when I finish my school I just go back and make my own food, because in Mongolia mothers’ work is not to, like, stay at home or do housework. Kids are taught to clean up the home and cook their food and  wash their clothes and that’s your work and usually the mothers don’t do that kind of thing. <br><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, so the children have to do all that work?<br><strong>Heidi: </strong>Yes.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> Actually it’s quite similar I think in the US pretty much. So what about your study load? Do you have a really <strong><i>heavy study load?</i></strong> Like, do you have two hours of homework a night or...?<br><strong>Heidi:</strong> It really depends on the school but for me, like, I was studying in an international school so I had to study quite hard to get the level still. So for me, I studied after school...I’d rather study at night, so I studied like 3 or 4 hours at night. So that’s my <strong><i>study habit</i></strong>. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> That’s a lot. <br><strong>Heidi:</strong> Not really compared to other students. <br><br>"
"<strong>Ron:</strong> My favorite cuisine has to be Hawaiian food.

OK. What about dessert? What's your favorite dessert?<br><strong>Mari:</strong> My favorite dessert <strong><i>has to be</i></strong> chocolate cake.<br><strong>Ron:</strong> Chocolate cake. Anything else? Do you like to eat it with anything? <br><strong>Mari: </strong>No, I like chocolate cake by itself. Anything else? I like brownie sundaes, like brownies and choc ... brownies with vanilla ice-cream. I guess my favorite dessert is anything chocolaty. <br><strong>Ron:</strong> Sounds good. So before you said you like to eat a salad. What type of salad, what type of vegetables do you like?<br><strong>Mari:</strong> I like all vegetables. I like them cooked or raw but I don't like raw onions.<br><strong>Ron:</strong> Not raw onions.<br><strong>Mari:</strong> I really can't eat onions <strong><i>raw</i></strong>. That's probably the only vegetable I can't eat raw.<br><strong>Ron:</strong> That's interesting. Thanks Mari.<br>"

One is you use a bounce called “bounce pass” and you can only use a <strong><i>bounce</i></strong> once. <br><strong>Dai: </strong>OK, to pass it to your teammate. <br><strong>Naomi: </strong>Yeah.<br><strong>Dai: </strong>OK, and what are the other passes? <br><strong>Naomi: </strong>There’s “chest pass”.<br><strong>Dai: </strong>And what’s that?<br><strong>Naomi: </strong>It’s just a straight pass from your chest to the other person’s chest.<br><strong>Dai: </strong>Oh OK.<br><strong>Naomi: </strong>And “shoulder <strong><i>pass</a>” which is sort of <a href=""../../ANA/AN/0901A/0927-5-Lob.mp3"">a lob</i></strong>. <br><strong>Dai: </strong>Like a lob, you throw it over your shoulder kind of thing. And so, it’s just...well like basketball somebody throws it in the net and how many points do you get?<br><strong>Naomi: </strong>It’s one point for every net - every ball that you get in the net. <br><strong>Dai: </strong>Oh OK. and how long is a game of netball?<br><strong>Naomi: </strong>Probably about an hour.<br><strong>Dai: </strong>Oh really?

You see different kinds of trends, but I think tight jeans and <strong><i>baggy jeans</i></strong> are very popular.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, wow, that's quite a difference.<br><strong>Mariel:</strong> <strong><i>It's a contrast</i></strong>. Yeah.<br><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, let's start with the baggy jeans. First of all, who likes to wear baggy jeans?<br><strong>Mariel:</strong> I think baggy jeans go with <strong><i>the hip-hop kind of style</i></strong>. Also, skateboarders really like to wear baggy jeans. People who like to feel relaxed and move around a lot are usually baggy jeans fans.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> What about you? Do you like to wear baggy jeans?<br><strong>Mariel: </strong>Oh, those are my favorite kind of jeans.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> Your favorite?<br><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yeah, I love to wear baggy jeans.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> Why is that?<br><strong>Mariel:</strong> It's just that they're so easy to wear and so relaxed and I can just do  whatever I want in baggy jeans I feel.<br><strong>Todd:</strong> Sounds good. Well, then what about tight jeans?<br><strong>Mariel:</strong> Mm, tight jeans. To me they're very unconfortable, but a lot of girls like to wear them. <br><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, usually only girls wear tight jeans?<br><strong>Mariel:</strong> Some guys do as well. Again, those people are usually very trendy and it's quite often that punk people and rock people wear tight jeans.<br>"

"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, Michael, you are into <span class=""audiodef"">spear fishing</span>!</p><p><strong>Michael: </strong>Yes, I enjoy going spear fishing<span></span></p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK. Can you talk about that a bit.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Michael: </strong>Yeah, sure. Spear fishing basically is a sport that you dive under the wate with <span class=""audiodef"">the aid of</span> flippers, wet suit and weights but you don&#39;t use oxygen at all it&#39;s all, you hyperventilate before you go down to get your oxygen levels up then you dive down...yeah, and then you hafta you sometimes hide under rocks or actually <span class=""audiodef"">stalk</span> the fish, and when you see a species that is edible and of <span class=""audiodef"">legal size</span> you can catch the fish</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, Wow. Now spear fishing, does that mean you throw the spear!</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Michael: </strong>No, you use spear guns which uses surgical rubber to propel the spear you just pull it down to cock it. It&#39;s kind of like a crossbow without the cross piece at the front.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So do you ever see sharks down there?</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Michael: </strong>Yeah, you occasionally see sharks, it depends on where you are. You see a lot of, there are some sharks called wabby-gones which are harmless sharks and they are actually quite friendly, and they won&#39;t attack you, but if you&#39;ve caught some fish and you keep them on your purse and the blood goes into the water it can attract bigger sharks, and a few times when we&#39;ve been spear fishing, we&#39;ve actually had the sharks come down and take the fish while we&#39;re there and it&#39;s a little bit scary but the sharks themselves are, they just sit there and watch you in the water. They&#39;re kind of like dogs, they, it&#39;s scary because they follow you, and they look at you, and you turn around and they&#39;ll be sitting there looking at you so most of the time we like to, when we catch the fish, to keep the blood out of the water we put them on a float that floats a <span class=""audiodef"">fair way</span> away from actually where you are fishing as a <span class=""audiodef"">safety precaution</span> if you know you see too many sharks you just get out of the water...but no, it&#39;s nice and exciting.</p>"

I would come and visit and that kind of stuff. We were really excited about it and he was a model at the agency, at the same agency where I was an actor and....so we had the same agent. He went to Japan and was teaching and we were <span class=""audiodef"">writing back</span> and forth looking forward to seeing you all that kind of stuff and I was having lunch with my agent one day and telling her that I had started taking Japanese and I had been planning out my trip and I was very excited about this whole thing and she says, JJ, I don&#39;t know how to tell you this.

And you lease not only the plane but engines as well?</p>                 <p><strong>Alexandra: </strong>Sometimes you have an airplane that's delayed at the airport because of some reason and they need to <span class=""audiodef"">swap an engine out</span>, or whatever.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Right before the plane takes off, they sometimes <span class=""audiodef"">switch</span> engines?</p>                 <p><strong>Alexandra: </strong>They'll <span class=""audiodef"">take the passengers off</span> and put them on another plane cause it takes a lot longer than the 10 or 15 minute <span class=""audiodef"">turnaround</span>, but, you will have, it's more an emergency type of situation, so they'll take the engine off, and it might be and overnight deal so we go ahead and furnish a replacement engine until they can move that plane back to where it belongs or have the engine repaired. </p>                 <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So can you lease a pilot?</p>                 <p><strong>Todd: </strong>You can, yes, you can lease a crew.

"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, Travis, what is your favorite movie?</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>My favorite movie of all time is the original Star Wars.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, that was a pretty great movie.</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>The original Star Wars was a fantastic fantasy set in space, with great characters, and while simple I thought meaningful story, but you know, it meant something to me, especially whenI was a kid.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah! Who was your favorite character?</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>My favorite character was Darth Vader.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>What? You got to be kidding me!</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>When I used to play Star Wars as a kid with my friends we used to always fight over who had to be Luke Skywalker, and who got to be Darth Vader. Who ever got to be Darth Vader always got to kill Luke Skywalker.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow. Why do you think that Star Wars is such a popular movie?</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>Well, I think of the time that the original Star Wars came out it was unique in a way that no other movie had really been, and so that was part of it. It used special affects in a way that no other movie ever had, andI think America was looking for a feel good fantasy movie that basically, while simple really made peoplefeel like there are good things out there and good sides out there and you could be on a good side. You know,you have the evil empire, which apparently were the British Empire, and, since all the actors had a British accent. And then you had the rebels, who were apparently, according to the director. What&#39;s his name again?</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>George Lucas</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>George Lucas. I was about to say Luke Skywalker, but I was pretty sure he didn&#39;t direct it. According to George Lucas were the Americans, so it seemed like it was a replay of the revolutionary war, in some senses, though he also borrowed from some Japanese movies too. Notably he borrowed from KitaKurasawa&#39;s The Hidden Forstress I&#39;m not really sure what the Japanese title is of The Hidden Fortress but in English it&#39;s translated as &#39;The Hidden Fortress and in that movie, it&#39;s a movie where, what&#39;s his name, Nufume?, the actor, he is actually protecting a princess who has to go in hiding because an enemy samurai clan has destroyed her family, and then the whole movie is told, that movie, The Hidden Fortress, is told from the point of view of two bumbling idiots who sort of go around, provide slap stick comedy almost for the whole movie and are a basically the role models for CP30 and R2D2 in the movie Star Wars cause in Star Wars the whole movie is sort of in a way shown from the point of view, beginning with these two characters, CP30 and R2D2, and they progress most of the movie, until the end when Luke Skywalker sort of becomes more important and Obi One Kanobi enters the scene, but at every point it&#39;s always CP30 and R2D2 sort of gluing the scenes together in a lot of ways</p><p></p>"
"                                            <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Hey, Lois, so what do you think about the World, not the World Cup, the Euro Cup so far?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>So far it's been an interesting tournament. I didn't expect to see Greece and Portugal make it to the final. I was a little bid disappointed with England's performance, but I think<i> they were beaten by a better team.</i></p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, really, you think so!</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>I think on the day Portugal probably played better than we did and even though we were unlucky because we had a goal disallowed in the last minute, but yeah, at the end of the day, I think at the end of the day, they probably deserved to win.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Mm, so what happened in the match?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>So I think if I remember correctly, the match was 2-all, but I can't remember exactly now. No, 1-all because at the last minute England scored to make it 2-1, but that goal was disallowed so then it went to extra time and then I think Portugal scored first, then England scored again to make it 2-all and then it went to penalties, and David Beckham missed, uh a terrible terrible goal, missed a penalty, and then I think Portugal missed one and then England missed again and then Portugal's goalkeeper scored and then it was all over.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Ah, well, maybe next time.</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>Maybe, maybe World Cup in Germany in 2006.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So who do you think is going to win it all?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>So in the first match, it was Portugal against Greece and Greece won 2-1, so although Greece are the underdogs, I think maybe they can win, but it is in Portugal, so maybe Portugal will win with the home crowd.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Are you going to watch it?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>I would love to watch it, but in Japan it's on at 3:45 in the morning, and so I don't think I'm going to miss my sleep to watch it.</p><p></p>                                        "
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So Travis, this summer we have the Olympics. Are you going to watch the Olympics on TV?</p><p><strong>Travis:</strong> I will probably get suckered into watching the olympics I&#39;m sure. It will be on every channel. It will only be on one channel but it will be on the whole day I&#39;m sure.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, they kind of go overboard. It&#39;s on too much.</p><p><strong>Travis:</strong> Well, I think it was the last winter Olympics, where, I don&#39;t know which channel in the Unites States was covering it but whatever channel was covering it most of the olympics was just people&#39;s background and personal stories and profiles and a lot of America got really fed up with it, and I don&#39;t know if you were still here in Japan or if you were in the Unites States at the time of the last olympics, but<br />people didn&#39;t watch he last olympics in the states. They just tuned out completely. The reason that they tuned out is because the coverage was so poor. The station that was covering it was basically just doing profile after profile of athletes, about how they had to overcome hardship, how they had to eat one meal every two weeks , and you know run five hundred miles back and forth, you know, some school in Russia and those sort of profiles, stories drown out the actual events, and it was covered very poorly, but maybe this year will be different, maybe there will be a backlash against that sort of poor coverage, and we&#39;ll get to see more of the actual olympics this time. This is the summer olympics right. (Yeah, exactly) It shows how little I know about the olympics. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the winter of the summer.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, of the Olympics, what&#39;s your favorite event?</p><p><strong>Travis:</strong> Running.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Running</p><p><strong>Travis:</strong> Just straight running. It seems like a very pure athletic event. There&#39;s no guess work in it. There&#39;s not five judge panel trying to decide who won, and then the Canadian judge and the France judge get in a fight and they have to decide<strong>. </strong>Nothing like that happens. It&#39;s just run, clock, stop and whoever got through the finish line the fastest wins. It seems very pure athleticism, so I like running: 100 meter dash,<br />200 meter dash, all of that, and long runs too. I used to run when I was in high school so that helps a little bit. Not short distances. I used to run cross country, three and five miles.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Ooh, that&#39;s a long ways. Are you still a runner?</p><p><strong>Travis:</strong> Well I went running tonight<strong> </strong>but I don&#39;t consider myself to be much of a runner. No, I only say that some day I am going to train and run a marathon but I have yet to train and run a marathon. Maybe someday. Yeah, I did it when I was in Bangkok and it about killed me. Yeah, running in Bangkok, running a marathon in Bangkok was not the smartest thing. It was terrible because they had, they have pollution right, Bangkok&#39;s a great city but they have a lot of pollution right. They have to have marathon at 4 o&#39;clock in the morning before the cars start running, and then when you&#39;re running the marathon some of the policeman that are officiating have to wear like masks because of the pollution in the air, so when you&#39;re running a marathon through that it&#39;s not that fun.<strong> </strong>But anyway, you should do it. You should run a marathon.<br />I think maybe I will but perhaps after I finish school this year.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Steve: </strong>Hi, this is Steve. I&#39;d like to talk about pizza. Pizza is my favorite food. I like it because you can have pizza every day and it can be different each time. My favorite toppings on pizza are pepperoni, mushrooms, basil, garlic. I like lots of cheese also. Olives are really good on Pizza as well. I like pizza with a thick crust but I also like the crust to be somewhat crunchy. I know how to make pizza quite well and I think some of the best pizzerias that you can go to usually serve it with olive oil, chili&#39;s and parmesan cheese. That&#39;s how I like it.</p>"

"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>Steve, I have a friend who wants to go study in Canada. What&#39;s the best way for a student to get into a Canadian University?</p><p><strong>Steve: </strong>Well, it all depends on your nationality, and your level of English, in terms of your TOEFL score. If you have a very low TOEFL score then probably your best bet would be to first go to Canada for three to six months and study in an English college there, and try to improve your English. While in Canada you can take practice TOEFL tests, and you can find tutors to help you write essays, then when you return to your home country, if it&#39;s Japan, there&#39;s lots of good English schools, English tutors in Japan, Korea as well. I&#39;m not too familiar with other countries but basically you have to apply for a student visa. It&#39;s usually not that difficult to get. Along with your student visa, you&#39;ll have to take a TOEFL test, which requires you to understand grammar. There&#39;s a listening portion, um, there&#39;s a reading comprehension portion, and the most difficult portion for non-native English speakers is the essay question, because you have to write an essay during the TOEFL test, so I recommend that you practice writing essays and if you want more information I would ask the Canadian Embassy in your country or do a search on the internet where there&#39;s lots of information.</p><p></p><p></p>"

"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, Eli, you&#39;re young and you&#39;re into Manga, so I take it you like video games?</p><p><strong>Eli: </strong>Mm-hm, I do very much. It&#39;s my other hobby. Um, almost an obsession sometimes. I think my friends get quite worried about me sometimes, the amount I play, but yeah I&#39;ve always since I&#39;ve been little liked computer games. I think my dad on his old macintosh forced us into it originally, so I blame it all on him, but that sort of developed into obviously in my field that I do which is animation. It&#39;s very close connected to it, and I&#39;d like to maybe work making computer games one day, uh.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>What&#39;s a really good game? What do you think is the best game?</p><p><strong>Eli: </strong>My favorite games are I think a split between two, the Final Fantasy series, which is a spread of lots of different games which are RPG which are role playing games, where you are, you&#39;re a character, or party of characters and you run around talking to people, discovering things, fighting battles, lots and lots of puzzles, lots of secrets. That&#39;s what I like.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Is the setting now or the future or the past?</p><p><strong>Eli: </strong>The setting&#39;s always in some fantasy world, but you don&#39;t know about. That&#39;s kind of, that&#39;s one of the nice things about computer games, it&#39;s almost escapism. You can escape the reality of the real world and go and run around in some fantastical world I mean, now that the graphics and computer games are getting so advanced it really does feel like your going into a new world of your own actually,and that you&#39;re there running around, so yeah, that&#39;s great and I think my other favorite game would have to be the SIMS series, which is,<br />started with SIM city, which is a little city building game, where you&#39;re the mayor of the city.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>You&#39;re the mayor!</p><p><strong>Eli:</strong> You&#39;re the mayor of the city and you have to build up your city over hundreds of years and advance it, and then from that they made the SIMs which actually goes into the houses and you control the lives of the little SIM people in the houses. It&#39;s almost like playing dolls houses, but very, very advanced and they have their own wants and needs and they fall in love and they go to work and it&#39;s basically just determining the destinies of your little character and furnishing their houses at the same time, which is always fun.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow, what a game! So actually, shows how old I am, you said, computer games! So you don&#39;t say video games anymore?</p><p><strong>Eli: </strong>Well, the SIMS and SIM City, I mean the first SIM City series I played on, probably the Mac had only just got a hard drive, um, really old when I was about, sort of seven or eight, even younger than that, so yeah, those PC games, mac games, and also video games, video games are Play Station, the ones that you play on the TV.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Which to you prefer a play station or an actual arcade game to play on?</p><p><strong>Eli: </strong>Uh, I never actually got into arcade games, cause you got to put money in to play them so, and I don&#39;t<br />think my, our parents ever wanted us to sort of waste money like that so.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>What kind of player do you have: a play station?</p><p><strong>Eli: </strong>I have a play station, and a Dreamcast, and an X box, and a Game Cube, and an N64 and a Gameboy</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow, I don&#39;t even know what those are.</p><p><strong>Eli: </strong>And a PC!</p><p></p>"

You should not get attached to money, or you shouldn&#39;t get attached to fancy cars and fancy clothes. You should try to simplify your life and have as little as possible. Be comfortable but don&#39;t have too much. Don&#39;t have, don&#39;t be excessive with what you have, and I believe in this philosophy.<br /><br />The Buddhist religion also has a philosophy of karma, of the cycle of good behavior, brings you good behavior in return and if you act bad, bad things will happen to you, and I think this is kind of true because if you do good things for people, most of the time good things happen to you. People treat you well. If you treat people poorly, and badly, people will treat you badly, so believe in this Buddhist philosophy of Karma and good things will happen to you if you do good things for others.<br /><br />Canada is a very peaceful country, and I&#39;m a peaceful guy. I don&#39;t believe in fighting and I don&#39;t believe in war, and my neighbor, across the border, the United States of America is at the moment at war with Iraq and for me this is a very senseless or sort of silly thing to be doing. I think it wastes money and it wastes lives and I think there should always be sort of, some sort of peaceful way to end an argument so I believe in peace and I don&#39;t think war should be, I think war is a waste of time, and a waste of people and a waste of lives.<br /></p>"
"                          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, how was your trip to Thailand?</p> <p><strong>Gloria: </strong>Oh, I spent about six weeks in Thailand and had a really, really great time. I spent three weeks in Northern Thailand and then three weeks on the beach in the southern part of Thailand but my last night I was packing up and I had a suitcase in the corner with the warm clothes from Northern Thailand and I saw something dark in the corner, and I'm thinking,"" Oh, it's just some clothes that fell out of my suitcase so I reach out to grab the clothes and something dark rose up and spread out and it was the weirdest feeling because at the same time I felt like a hand grab me from behind and yanked me out of the cabin and I didn't feel any fear until I was in the middle of the clearing and I screamed twice, and got everybody's attention, ""What? What? What?"" and I said ""snake"" and of course a few people started laughing, thinking,<br /> ""Oh, well, this little bitty green, harmless snake"" Ah, no big deal. So one of the little bitty Thai girls, walks into my cabin and she comes running out, ""Ah, snake!"" and so it was a black king cobra, which is the most poisonous snake in the world, and this is really kind of scary because my little brother had been killed by a snake and so it's frightening to me to think how close I came. After I left Thailand, two things happened: I found some photographs in which in the photographs that I took of my cabin you could see the snake crawling into my cabin and the other one is an e-mail from the owners of the resort that they found two more cobras underneath my bed.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow, oh man! So normally do they have king cobras on that part of the island?</p> <p><strong>Gloria: </strong>No, they don't. They say they may come in when they transport, the building, they're making a lot of new buildings so they brought in wood from Northern Thailand and maybe it came in there. Also the envirorment's being upset and they're chopping down a lot of trees, and they're finding more and more snakes that they didn't know were there. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow, well, you're very lucky. </p> <p><strong>Gloria: </strong>Yeah, I've been told that!</p> <p><br /></p>               "
"<p><strong>Jeff: </strong>My brothers and I just did a really fun and difficult journey across India in a rickshaw. It&#39;s, a rickshaw is a three-wheeled, a little three-wheeled vehicle. It&#39;s a cross between a car and a motorcycle. It has no doors and it has no trunk to put luggage in, and it has a little, it has a little steering bar like a motorcycle and it doesn&#39;t go very fast, and we drove this all the way across the country from Bangladesh to Pakistan, and it was a crazy journey, it was crazy, very dangerous and full of surprises and very hard of your body and your mind and I did this, with my two brothers in a rickshaw. My brothers and I filmed the entire journey in the rickshaw with a professional video camera. One of my dreams in life is to make a documentary for TV and we decided to make a documentary of our trip across India and it was very difficult. We thought it would be easy, but when we started to do this it was very, very tough. They make it look easy on television and when you have the camera and you&#39;re trying to video people it&#39;s very difficult. They don&#39;t do what you want to do and the weather doesn&#39;t cooperate with you, and maybe the camera breaks down and you&#39;re tired and you can&#39;t get the video shots that you want and it becomes like a game, or struggle, trying to get the best shots, trying to get the most interesting shots, and it is like a game, a fun, and frustrating game, but by the end of the trip, we managed to get all of the video, and we put together a very interesting three minute video, and a couple of Indian video producers helped us put this together, and you can see the short video on the web site www.eagarbros.com, and I think you&#39;ll like it. It&#39;s full of surprises and full of funny and strange sites and full of action, so, it&#39;s pretty good. I think you&#39;ll like it.<br /></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So Travis, you said your brother is getting married.</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>Well, actually not my brother, my cousin is getting married. On my family&#39;s side of the family, on my father&#39;s side of the family, I have quite a few cousins and quite a few uncles and aunts. My dad is one of eight children, so we&#39;ve always been very close and basically we&#39;ve been a nuclear family around my grandparents of my dad&#39;s side, so my cousin, Brian, is going to be getting married in Puerto Viarta, Mexico, and I think that wedding is taking place about August 9th.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, wow.</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>So we are all going to be going out there as a family. Hopefully we&#39;ll have as many as maybe forty of us, and whoever the bride invites , and we&#39;ll be on the beach for about 3 or 4 days, and have a wedding of Saturday, so it should be pretty exciting.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Mexico, that&#39;s an interesting choice. I mean, that&#39;s pretty far away.</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>It is pretty far away so it should be kind of expensive for all the guests to get there, which might be planned on my cousin&#39;s side because he might be trying to limit the amount of people who come to his wedding, so it won&#39;t get to overly large, and Mexico is actually cheaper to have a wedding than the United States because the power of the dollar versus the power of the peso, is you know, quite strong,<br />so you can go down to Mexico and for maybe a third the price have the same lavish wedding you might have in the United States, though Puerto Viarta might be a little more expensive than a normal Mexican wedding because Puerto Viarta is sort of a tourist and resort community.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Have you been to Puerto Viarta before?</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>I&#39;ve never been there before. In fact, even though I am from Southern California and from Los Angeles basically, which is only two hours from Mexico, I&#39;ve never been to Mexico.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>I&#39;m from San Francisco and even I&#39;ve been to Mexico.</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>Well, Tijuana is a place everybody goes to, and it&#39;s never had any big appeal for me. Typically, southern Californians will go there, as soon they turn 18 , cause at 18 you can drink in Tijuana, and you can&#39;t drink in California when you&#39;re 18. You have to wait until you are 21, so that&#39;s a big reason to go I suppose, but I never made it down there.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy Mexico.</p><p><strong>Travis: </strong>I&#39;m sure I will.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So Adrienne, what did you think of the restaurant?</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> It was good. The food was tasty but not as good as Italian food at home.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, I kind of think the same thing. It seemed like the noodles were a little hard, I guess you can say.</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> Yeah. Plastic.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> Like, yeah, I agree.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Did you like the salad?</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> Uh, salad was good, but it&#39;s hard to mess up salad.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, although that salad was pretty nice, right. It was chicken and sauce and peppers and stuff so...</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> And asparagus.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Like I can&#39;t make that salad. So that was pretty good.</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s true. I guess your right.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>And what did you think about the pizza?</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> The pizza was delicious. I would like it to be a little bigger, because pizza at home is usually much bigger but, it was still very good.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, I forgot, how much was the bill. How much did we pay?</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> About 3,000 yen I think.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>3,000 yen, so what do you think? Is that expensive or cheap or?</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> That seems pretty standard for Tokyo I think.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>Sarah , so what sports do you like?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>My favorite spectator sport is football. I support Newcastle United in England.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Newcastle United.</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Newcastle United, Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Are they a good team?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Um, yeah, I think they&#39;re pretty good. They finished fifth in the premiereship this year,<br />so they&#39;re near the top.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, so right now we have the Euro cup. And last night England played.</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>They did</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, did you see the game?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Ah, no I was going to watch it tonight actually in Shibuya but I&#39;m thinking maybe not now<br />because we lost on penalties.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, what was the score?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Ah, the final score was 2 all (2-2) and then it went to penalties and I think it was 6-4.<br />So England always lose on penalties.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>They always lose on penalties?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Yeah</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, sorry. Maybe in the World Cup, next time.</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Maybe. Maybe. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Now do you ever play football?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>No, I&#39;ve never played.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Never</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Never played, no.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK. Do you ever go and watch games in Newcastle?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Um, it&#39;s very difficult to watch games in Newcastle because it&#39;s a big club and it&#39;s Premiereship<br />and you have to book in advance quite a few years but I&#39;ve seen some first division football clubs<br />play against each other.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>You have to get tickets two years in advance?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>For the big clubs, yeah. They&#39;re booked up.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>That&#39;s pretty intense. So when there&#39;s a game on TV then what do you do? Do you watch it at home? Do you go to a pub?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Ah, it depends on the game. I like it and I like Premeireship football, and I like World Cup football<br />and Euro 2000 but I wouldn&#39;t watch particularly a first division game on the television, but normally I would go to the pub with friends and watch the game.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Do you think that athletes make to much money?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>I think footballers do. Yeah, I think they do. I think they do a good job but I think they&#39;re incredibly overpaid.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, I think it is the same thing in the states. I think they make too much money.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>Lois, when are you going back to London, or England?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>I&#39;m going back on the 30th of July.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, that&#39;s coming up pretty soon.</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>Just four more weeks. Four weeks from today, I&#39;ll be on the plane, on my way home.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, when you go home, what are you going to do?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>In September I&#39;m going back to college because I want to be a primary school teacher in England, so I have to do a one year course to qualify and then hopefully I&#39;ll start teaching the next September back in England.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, and what are you going to teach?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>So, I&#39;m teaching primary so that&#39;s all subjects. I&#39;m teaching science and English and math and maybe some French and sports and music and any other subjects they do at eight years old.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, how old will the students be?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>So I will be trained to teach from 5 to 11, and hopefully I will teach 7 or 8 year olds.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Mm, you like kids?</p><p><strong>Lois:</strong> I hope so. Yeah, when I worked in Prague I taught some children&#39;s classes and I really, really enjoyed them, so hopefully I will like it in England as well. Although it will be a bit different because I&#39;ll have maybe twenty five or thirty students in a class so it might be slightly different to the twelve when I was in Prague.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>That&#39;s a lot. What made you decide to become a teacher?</p><p><strong>Lois: </strong>I&#39;m not really sure because my mother was a teacher and she&#39;s trying really hard to convince me that I shouldn&#39;t do it because she thinks its too much work but I enjoy talking to people and being around children and teaching so hopefully it will be nice for me.</p><p></p>"
"                                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So Kevin, you were saying that you've been poor, broke, a couple of times.  You talked about being in New York, and being broke.  When else have you been broke?                 <p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Wow.  Well, after New York, the following year, when I came down from New York, I was determined to be my own boss.  I had not been <span class=""audionotes"">in control of</span> my life while I was in New York.  It was all depending on other people to let me have a job.  And when I lost the job, that really, that really hurt.</p>                 <p>And so when I went home I decided that I was going to own my own business, and I opened my first business which was a Karate school, and I put a lot of money into it that I had worked for almost a year saving up and then, well I also had a small <span class=""audionotes"">inheritance</span> from my grandmother.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh okay.</p>                 <p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah.  But I ended up losing all of the money in the Karate school.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now did you actually know Karate?</p>                 <p><strong>Kevin: </strong>Yes.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh you do?</p>                 <p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I do.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I did not know that about you.</p>                 <p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That would have been a strange business to start if I didn't know it.  But yeah, yeah, I'd done it, I started when I was a kid.  And, at the time, I was 20, I think 20, just about to turn 21 when I opened it.  And I was ni-dan at the time, second degree black belt, and I had been teaching at my instructor's school for a while and he had encouraged me, you know, to go ahead and do it.  But it was the wrong location, and the wrong town, the town was really poor.  And I lost about $20,000 in 6 months.</p>                 <p><img src=""../../Assets/images/P0301/350-Broke.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""395"" height=""224"" /></p>                 <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That's a lot of money.</p>                 <p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That is a lot of money.  Especially to a 21 year old who, you know...</p>                 <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, $20,000 when you're 21, you can live for like 3 years.</p>                 <p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Right, and not a year and half earlier I was <span class=""audionotes"">flat busted</span> broke in New York, and then, you know, things <span class=""audionotes"">picked up</span> and I thought that I could really try and make something of it.  But you know, <span class=""audionotes"">nothing ventured, nothing gained</span>, and that was the attitude that I had, and, you know, found myself broke again.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So that fact that you've been poor, but you were poor both times when you were very young, do you look back and are you glad that you had those experiences?</p>                 <p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Sure.  Sure, I learned a lot.  Those experiences were valuable.  You can't buy that kind of experience, you know, I carry it around with me now.  I listen to other people who have business ideas and, you know, one thing that I gained from it is I can tell if they are going into a business, if they're gonna try and start up a business and, you know, they haven't considered all the things that they really need to consider, I can see <span class=""audionotes"">the pitfalls</span> that I fell in.  And, you can try and suggest people to, you know, make other arrangements or to be more careful about this or that, but it doesn't always <span class=""audionotes"">work out</span>.  Sometimes they just have to go out and <span class=""audionotes"">learn the hard way</span> like I did.</p>"
"<strong>Todd:</strong> So Kevin, I thought we would talk about money today, and you have many interesting stories about being <span class=""audionotes"">broke</span>.<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes. I have been broke a number of times. Anything in particular that you would like to hear? I&#39;ve got <span class=""audionotes"">quite a bunch</span>.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> So tell me when was the first time you were really broke?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> The first time I was really broke was, I was 19, and I moved to New York City. I followed a girl that I met in Glacier National Park, I was working out there as a singing waiter.</p><p>Went out to New York, followed her, and I <span class=""audionotes"">ended up</span> living in an apartment with three other people and the share of my rent was $500 a month. Now that was 20 years ago, and $500 a month 20 years ago to a 19 year old kid with no education, no experience... that was a lot.</p><p><img alt=""image"" height=""227"" src=""../../Assets/images/P0301/349-Broke480.jpg"" width=""387"" /></p><p>So I worked three jobs. I worked from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. at the George Washington Street Bus Terminal and subway station <span class=""audionotes"">handing out flyers</span>, American Express Moneygram flyers, then I would take the subway to Midtown, to FAO Schwartz, you know the big toy store...</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh yeah, right.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ...from the movie, Big...</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s really famous.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ...where he dances on the piano. Yeah, and I was... I would wrap presents there. And then I would work there from 11 to 4, and then I would take the subway back down to <span class=""audionotes"">The Village</span> where I was living, and I would work from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. as a waiter and bus boy.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">That&#39;s brutal</span>. That&#39;s pretty harsh.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s really brutal. Well, how I ended up being broke was, the restaurant was a New Orleans style restaurant, and I got fired for talking to the customers too much. <span class=""audionotes"">Truth is</span>, the customers were interested in the fact that I was from New Orleans and it was a New Orleans style restaurant. And for... I lasted two more months. And I only had enough money everyday to buy a slice of cheese pizza and a pack of cigarettes. And...</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> That&#39;s it?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That&#39;s it.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>One slice of pizza and a pack of cigarettes.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Well, and a Hostess Fruit Pie lunch. But one time, during lunchtime at FAO Schwartz, I went down to the vending machine and I got my Hostess Fruit Pie and I took a bite in it and it was hollow. There was no fruit in it and I really had a small <span class=""audionotes"">panic attack</span>, and I called the <span class=""audionotes"">toll free number</span> on it, and I complained, You just don&#39;t understand how much of my <span class=""audionotes"">daily nutritional intake</span> that pie represented, and all he did was apologize and I was hoping they would send me a case of pies, but they didn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> No such luck.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That&#39;s right. When I went home, I was probably about 30 pounds lighter than before I left. And I was really poor. So that&#39;s the first time I was really broke.</p>"
"                          <p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>So, Trina I understand you got a new job recently. What are you doing?</p> <p><strong>Trina: </strong>I am a flight attendant for a charter airline, World Airways, out of the United States, and we do mostly military charters into military air force bases and we do some other American football teams and some oil tycoons into Africa.</p> <p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Ooh, that sounds like an interesting job.</p> <p><strong>Trina: </strong>It is. It's very interesting. I get to travel all over the world to some destinations that people normally would not travel to.</p> <p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> Like what?</p> <p><strong>Trina: </strong>Like Osan Korea, which would not actually be a city if it were not for our American military being in the city. I've also been to Kuwait, and Frankfurt, and Tachikawa, Japan.</p> <p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>I see so it's kind of a mix of some big cities and then some smaller cities that you visit. What's your favorite city so far?</p> <p><strong>Trina: </strong>So far, I'd have to say that Tokyo is my favorite city. Lots of stuff to do. My sister lives there. Lots of shopping. Very fun, but super cold.</p> <p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Well, that's because of the time of year. Wait till you come in the summer. It gets really hot.</p> <p><strong>Trina: </strong>I can't wait.</p>               "
"                                  <p>I was browsing through a bookshop today and I picked up a book on food, which is quite usual for me cause I love food, em, but this book was a bit different, em, it tried to make the connection between the kind of food you eat and how it makes you feel so, for example, sometimes if I'm, if I'm a bit sad, we’ll say, I think to myself, oh, I’d love some chocolate and that will make me feel better, and sometimes it does, or it feels like it does anyway. I’m not sure if that really works, but the author of this book seemed to think that there’s a definite link between, what you, you know, what you eat and how you feel, or how it makes you feel. She talks about things like, em, yeah, things like chocolate and other sweet things. She says that it releases endorphins, so that, you know endorphins are chemicals, they kind of, they make you feel good, I think is the idea. They help you deal with stress as well as she says, so yeah, that seems to, that seems to work, I think. One of my friends told me recently that when she feels a bit, a bit sluggish as if she doesn’t have much energy, she’ll go to a restaurant or go home and cook some meat cause she feels that that gives her, gives her energy, so I was interested to read today that this author, she mentions how sometimes the body will feel a need to, I don’t know, to be more sharp, or to have energy and that sometimes that means that you need protein and protein obviously would comes from meat. It seems to work for my friend anyway, but I haven’t tried it myself anyway.<strong></strong></p>               "
"                                  <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">I think food is such a great subject, such an interesting subject. I mean, food is something that everyone has to do. It's a life necessity, and actually because of that it can be a real hassle, like when you have to eat when you're hungry but you really can't be bothered to make anything. You can't go out and buy anything. You don't have the money to go out and buy anything is the worst thing, but when you're not in that situation food is great. Um, I'm just sort of thinking over all the different types of food I've eaten throughout my life and the sort of real spread, range of food, throughout different countries. I mean, I come from England where, I wouldn't say England really had a very specific scene of it's own. I think, you know, very nice English restaurant food is probably more like French restaurant food. The only sort of staple things that everyone knows comes from England are obviously Fish and Chips which actually, normal English people don't eat that much of. I probably eat Fish and Chips 3 times a year. Maybe if I lived a bit further north, I'd eat it once a week, but that is known as the sort of number one English dish. Although that's really junk food, and I think a good roast with gravy , Yorkshire pudding, baked potatoes. I see that as proper English food, but just thinking, now living in Japan, the difference between the food in England and the food in Japan, and then I've been brought up very much on like Chinese food as well. My mom always cooked lots of Chinese food, and in England of course, the number one favorite food is Indian curry, and all these different foods are so, so different from each other, just flavors, what you use, I mean, cooking here, is really depressing when it gets to about 7 o'clock in the evening here, cause I go down in the guest house I'm living in, and I walk into the kitchen area, and just the whole area smells amazing from where all the Japanese residents are cooking their normal Japanese meal, which are totally normal to them, but to a foreigner, they seem like these amazingly elaborate meals where I'm sure, like roast beef and Yorkshire pudding would seem the same to a Japanese person, but it's a pity really that sort of countries aren't more, sort of aware of sharing their food with each other. I mean when I get back to England, I'm gonna be in a whole load of trouble cause all the food I eat here, all the ingredients that I need, you can only get in Japan: they're specific Japanese vegetables, or in Asia at least, and I'm gonna have to get to very specific supermarkets to get even half the stuff I want and all the things like the nice vegetables I won't be even able to buy. <br /></font></p>               "

"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Greg, in your travels have you ever eaten any wild food?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Greg:</strong> Oh, yeah, in Thailand I ate a lot of different wild food. One time, I had a really unusual experience. I was with one of the teachers from my school, and a couple of his friends and those guys are hunters. We went into the rain forest of Thailand, and we slept that night in an old tin mine.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> A tin mine? Was it open, or was it still?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Greg:</strong> No, it was closed down, there were still a couple of old buildings there and you could have a fire. It was very exciting, and then in the morning, we went walking through the woods, but actually in the rain forest, it's really hard to walk. The only place you can really walk is through, up the river. There are so many thick branches,... but I was talking a photographs, at one point in the forest, and I saw in the corner of my eye my friend suddenly pick up their rifles and the were shooting at something in a tree, and then this animal came down, and I was amazed. It was a, in Thai they say ""mi meow"", which means bearcat, very low to the ground, thick fur animal and it came running down the stream towards me and my friends were shooting. At first, I was all, ""Oh, this is so interesting"" taking a picture and then I thought, ""Oh, my God! This wounded animal is coming towards me and that is the most dangerous animal, and they kept shooting and it actually died about one meter away from me.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Whoa! It almost got you!</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Greg:</strong> Yeah, and my friends</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> It wanted revenge.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Greg:</strong> They should have gone to the hunters.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. Right. Wrong guy.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Greg:</strong> My friend's tied the bear up to a piece of bamboo and carried it back through he forest to where we were camping, and they cut up the meat and they cooked it, very hot and spicy Thai dish. It was delicious, and the next day, they brought the rest of the meat back to their village, and I thought it was very interesting, but then the next week, I went into another town and I saw an exhibition about endangered animals in Thailand, and that animal was an endangered animal, (Oh!) so I felt really bad about it, afterwards. (Yeah) I would never have eaten an endangered animal if I had known.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow! Man. Well, you know, at least you didn't pull the trigger.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Greg:</strong> That's true. I used the chopsticks. <br /></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "

I mean I love chocolate, so you know, for sure. I've lived in Belgium for several months and I got used to really, really good Belgium chocolate.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Adrienne:</strong> Very good chocolate there!</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mike:</strong> Absolultely, so yeah! It's kind of, if I do occasionally I'll have a little bit of Belgium chocolate.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Adrienne:</strong> Mm, that sounds good.

"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, so Alan, you know, you were a baker so can you explain to the listeners: how do you bake bread?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Alan:</strong> Well, you need, to make your basic white bread, white pan bread we call it, you need flour, yeast, sugar, shortening, salt, and water, so depending on how much you want to make, you, first of all, you throw in the flour into a big mixing bowl. Then you throw in the sugar, salt, and the shortening. You give it a mix. Turn on the machine and mix it a little bit because you don't want to have the yeast in direct contact the salt, because salt if it's in direct contact with the yeast, it kills, the yeast will not react and make the bread rise.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Alan:</strong> Then you take the yeast. Whatever amount of yeast you have, and the best way to do it, is you take your water, the amount of water that you need and you break up the yeast into the water, disolve it in the water, and then start the mixer and as the flour and all the other ingredients are mixing, you pour the water in slowly until you get the consistency that you want. That's one way or you can, after you mixed up the flour, the sugar and the salt and the shortening, a little bit, enough that it's mixed, blended together, you can just add the yeast into the mixture and then add the water, so you mix it until you, probably about, I think about eight minutes, or nine minutes, unitl the dough is developed, and it's a glob and you stop the mixer, you pull it off the bowl, you let it sit on the bench for about five minutes. </font><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">You let it rise. Then you divide it up, into I think about maybe two kilos, it depends on how big you want you loaf. Usually loaves are between seven and eight hundred grams, maybe one kilo. Divide it up and mold it and put it into the pan. It goes into a proofer. The proofer is a steam box with heat. Moisture and heat, and the bread rises and then when it's at a certain level in the proofer you take it out and put it in the oven.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. Sounds good. How long does it have to be in the oven?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Alan:</strong> The oven? Usually about twenty minutes. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> And that's it. It's done.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Alan:</strong> And then you pull it out of the oven and it's done. Fresh baked bread.</font></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                                  <p>I was browsing through a bookshop today and I picked up a book on food, which is quite usual for me cause I love food, em, but this book was a bit different, em, it tried to make the connection between the kind of food you eat and how it makes you feel so, for example, sometimes if I'm, if I'm a bit sad, we’ll say, I think to myself, oh, I’d love some chocolate and that will make me feel better, and sometimes it does, or it feels like it does anyway. I’m not sure if that really works, but the author of this book seemed to think that there’s a definite link between, what you, you know, what you eat and how you feel, or how it makes you feel. She talks about things like, em, yeah, things like chocolate and other sweet things. She says that it releases endorphins, so that, you know endorphins are chemicals, they kind of, they make you feel good, I think is the idea. They help you deal with stress as well as she says, so yeah, that seems to, that seems to work, I think. One of my friends told me recently that when she feels a bit, a bit sluggish as if she doesn’t have much energy, she’ll go to a restaurant or go home and cook some meat cause she feels that that gives her, gives her energy, so I was interested to read today that this author, she mentions how sometimes the body will feel a need to, I don’t know, to be more sharp, or to have energy and that sometimes that means that you need protein and protein obviously would comes from meat. It seems to work for my friend anyway, but I haven’t tried it myself anyway.<strong></strong><br /></p>               "

When you go, are you taking a tour, packaged tour or are you just going to go on your own like a backpacker?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, I haven't decided yet. Ah, both have their advantages and their disadvantages. (Mm, yeah!) Um, well, let's say with backpacking, it's cheap, and you can meet a lot of interesting people and you can sometimes stumble upon, really, really cool things or interesting places by chance. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Hm, it's true, but if you do a packaged tour, they usually have the expertise about the area. You'll have a guide who can speak the language.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, if I go for a short-time, which is probably the case I think packaged tours have, are also good because you're there for a short time. Everything is provided for you and you can just enjoy fun in the sun, or culture. Basically, your mind can relax. </font><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">When you're a backpacker you always have to think about everything, you know. ""Can I find a place to stay?"", ""Is this place safe?"" you know, ""Are my belongings safe?"" uh, things like that. Packaged tour you just sit back and relax. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, I think it's always best to take a packaged tour if you travel with somebody, but it's always best to do backpacking if you're going to travel alone.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Absolutely, I agree. If you're alone, in, as a backpacker, you can meet people. You're forced to meet people. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, that's true. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Ah, if you took a packaged tour alone you'd probably be one lonely person, sitting on the beach, drinking your glass of lemonade or whatever drank and sitting there reading a book.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>So, on your trip to Southest Asia, are you going alone with somebody?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, we'll see won't we.</font><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""></font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><br /></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "

I can not stand the phone. I hate talking on the phone, so I have a hand-held phone and I always go and put it in the closet and I turn it off.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, really! Yeah, you said hand-held. I usually call it a cell phone or a mobile phone. (Yeah) but, uh, well, I mean, these days everybody has one, so uh, I think they're quite useful actually. You can call people when you want, and you can call people who you want. You don't have to pick up like you don't sometimes, it's.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>See the thing is, if somebody calls me, right, and I see that they called me, I feel really guilty for not calling them back, or no answering the phone if I'm very busy, so I don't want to feel guilty, so I just turn off the phone and put it in my closet.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, I guess that's why you like land lines, because you can pretend like you didn't hear it or that you weren't home at the time.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Exactly, I really miss the old style phones. The old phones that would ring and you'd have to walk over and pick up the phone. I thought those were great. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon:</strong> You know what, I think that you're just not going with progress. The old style, uh, life has changed, yeah, we use technology every day, and this is just the next step, you know, being able to communicate at all times, anywhere and anyhow, and we're using technology right now.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>That's true, I mean, obviously I have my website, I'm very into computers.

"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, I got a job interview coming up and I know they're gonna ask me about what are your strong points and your weak points. You know.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, that's tough, because like I know my strong points and my weak points.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, well, let's talk about that, actually, personality wise. Forget about the job interview. Let's talk about, what do you think, what are your strong points as a person?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Ah, let's see. Well, I think the biggest one is I'm pretty generous. Like I really don't care about money, so I'll give my friends money or things that I have, cause I just don't care about that. Um, so that's probably my strong point. My weak points are I am very late all the time. I'm late to work. I'm late to meet my friends. I'm late when I have appointments, and I am always late, so that is probably my number one bad point, and um, I'm, and sometimes I'm a little selfish. I want things my way, and only my way.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>So it's, do you use that expression, ""It's my way or the highway!""</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>I would never say that, but that's maybe how I think sometimes.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>That's how you feel inside, yeah.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>How about you? What are your strong points and your weak points?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, one of my weak points. I can say, much like you, was being late but, uh, since, you know, uh, since I've has a long term girlfriend, she's made sure that that part of me has changed, but I think one of my weak points is that, uh, I'm mentally disorganized. I'm all over the place all the time, so that sometimes makes me forget things like, uh, my keys, or you know, where I put an important piece of paper or something like that.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>You know sometimes I wonder, because I'm a teacher, that maybe more people are that way today because we have so much input, so much stimulus from TV, from the internet, from movies, from radio that we are not as mentally organized as people maybe 50 years ago.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, that quite, that could be possibly true, but most of my close friends, you know, say that I'm more disorganized in that way, or more chaotic than most people, so I think I'm a special case. You know, I lost my wallet about four or five times in the past year, so.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>That's pretty bad. Um, what's your strong point though?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, you know, that's putting me on the spot. That's a pretty difficult question cause it's difficult to talk about yourself, but uh, you know I would have to say that I'm friendly, and easy-going and.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, I agree actually.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>And uh, I think I have, I think I can get along with people well, so, that's would be my strong point I guess, easy going and and friendly, easy to get along with. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, I agree.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, thank you, and I agree about you. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>What?

I went to Baja, California.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Baja, California. Nice. Can you explain where Baja, California is?</p> <p><strong>Simon:</strong> Actually, it's not in California. It's south of California. It's in Mexico, and it's on the west side of Mexico, below California, of course, and it's a desert surrounded by beautiful ocean. Todd: Oh, sounds good. Sounds nice. What's the landscape like?</p> <p><strong>Simon:</strong> Dry, dusty, and beautiful.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So it's a desert?</p> <p><strong>Simon:</strong> Yeah, it's a desert with lots of cacti. </p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, OK. What are cacti?</p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, maybe you know what a cactus is. It's a, you know, the desert plant from Cowboy movies, and it has needles which stick and hurt and it's green, but yeah. That's about it and beautiful blue waters.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You mean water from the ocean.</p> <p><strong>Simon:</strong> Water from the ocean. There's no water on the land. You know, there's no lakes, probably no rivers, just dust, yeah!</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> How did you get there?</p> <p><strong>Simon:</strong> I drove. </p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>You drove?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah!

They have desserts, things like that.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, that makes sense, that's why it's called a family diner, or family restaurant because I guess everyone in the family will be happy if they eat there.

The only problem is that it's really crowded and it's a little expensive because it's very popular.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, really. Ah, do they have pizza? I like pizza. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Actually, they don't have pizza. They only have pasta.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>OK. What were the other choices?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>There's also a fish restaurant and there's a grilled chicken restaurant. A grilled chicken. That's pretty general.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>How do they serve that?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>It's actually, it's not a restaurant. This guy has a small stand, a very small area, and there are some small tables in front of it, and he just grills chicken, kind of on the street, and then he has little tables in front of his booth or stall and you eat chicken for really cheap. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, that sounds really cool. Let's do that.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, yeah, and they have beer, too.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, yeah, I like beer. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Cool, let's go. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon:</strong> OK. </font></p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Now, Mike, you're from Canada but you lived in America for a good period of time.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mike: </strong>Right!</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>How would you compare the two counties?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mike: </strong>Well, the most obvious difference is Canada is a lot colder, I think than the United States in general, that's cause were north of the U.S., but culturally, I think that the US has a lot, many more culturally different areas within the country than Canada does. Canada as a culture, even though it's different from east to west, for people in Atlantic Canada are quite different from, let's say, Ontario, or Quebec, different from the West Coast. In the U.S., there are many more of those cultural pockets like New York for example is very different from Florida, which is very different from Louisiana, or Georgia, which is very different from Texas of course and all of those are very different from California and all of those, again, are very different from the North West part of the U.S., Seattle and that area, so the U.S. has many, many more sort of culturally diverse areas, very, unique, and that's one, I think one significant difference between Canada and the U.S. </font><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Another difference is, Canada is obviously, one thing that many tourists point to, is a reason for going to Canada, Canada is safer than the U.S. Again, I think partly cause of gun laws and things like that, but just in general, I think the history of Canada sort of is a lot more, is a lot less, I guess, it was a lot less, there was no revolution really in Canada and there was in the U.S. so I mean I think the roots are a little bit less, more subdued, I'd say, so that makes a difference culturally. However, I think that because Canada is more safe, it's also more boring than the U.S., so the U.S., it’s maybe a little bit riskier but it's a lot more fun. Canada is safer but, again, more boring. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>That's interesting, I mean, I don't know. I haven't been to Canada but I would like to go.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mike: </strong>Definitely come up and visit and you'll know why you enjoy the States so much.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> I'm not so sure about that. All right, thanks, Mike.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mike: </strong>Sure.</font></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "

I was like the little bus driver for the team.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, well, you said ""bus"". Is that, did you call it a van or a bus?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Actually, in California we call it the Volkswagen Bus. Yeah, do you call it the bus or the van?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>I think that either was OK, or both were OK. Yeah, my family had the camperized van. (Really!) Which had little, which had a refrigerator and a table and a bed, and a pop-up top to fit, to fit another bed, like a loft. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow! Yeah, that's pretty cool. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>At least, uh, at least four people quite comfortably in a camper van. Pretty cool. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, actually, mine didn't have the camper. It had a flat area in back of the van, but not a bed, and it did have a small sink, although I never had water hooked up to my van, so I never used it. I just used it for school, so.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, my best friend had a van in high school as well. (Yeah!) and he was really popular there because he could fit a lot of people in. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>So my van was all white. What color was yours?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Ah, my parents' van was, was also, was also white. My friend's van had, was black and white and had a skull on the front. Yeah, so it looked like a a pirate van, or pirate bus, not a pirate ship, but a pirate van. (Cool!) It was pretty cool, at the time. You know. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah. Yeah. I actually, I have many nice memories of my van and I wish I still had one today.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, me too!</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah! Does your family still have it?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>No, they don't. Ah, time to move on, I guess. They thought. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah! I think I sold my van because I didn't think it was cool after awhile. I had it for three years and then I wanted a nice sports car, so I got rid of it. Yeah, I kind of regret it but I guess that's just normal.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Simon: </strong>Of course, everybody likes their old cars, don't they.</font></p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, Mike, you were born in Europe, but grew up in Canada. Have you been back to Europe?</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah, uh, I've been back to Europe on a couple of occasions. The first time, I guess I went back to Europe was in 1989, 1990, when I went to visit my brother who was studying in France in Paris, studying business at one of the business schools there. And during the trip, I'd, we'd rented a car, so we were driving around the country and one of the best memories I had was when we drove into Leon, in the center of France, and the people were really friendly, really fantastic and we just met some people in a bar who then invited us out to their cottage, in the <br /> country, the following day for a pig roast. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>A pig roast!</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yes!</p> <p><font size=""3""><strong>Todd: </strong>What is a pig roast? You put a pig on a stick?</font></p> <p><font size=""3""><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah, well, that's exactly, we had no, we thought it was just a barbeque but we drove through this tiny road into the middle of the forest it seemed, and, there was this, we came to a cottage, a small wooden, very old-looking cottage, and next to it there were roasting a gigantic pig on a big spit over an open fire, (Wow!) and there was one, one of the people that we met was there turning the spit so that the pig was being, obviously was being well-cooked, and he'd been there for several hours already doing this by the time we arrived about 1:00 in the afternoon, and it was </font>interesting. It was amazing. They told us the history of this little cottage that belonged to one of the people. It was several hundred years old, and apparently, it used to be a hide-out for French pirates.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>No way!</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah! Yeah, and it looked like a wooden shack. It didn't really look like something, which would be perfect as a hide-out because no one would suspect it. But it was fascinating. They even had pictures on the walls of two of the pirates that I guess visited or had visited been there during that time, and so, a lot of, just it's incredible, the history, and the culture that you'll find in that small little shack in the woods, in the middle of Leon.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That is cool! </p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah, that is neat.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That is really cool! Nice, so um, what happened? You had lunch and then you.</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>We had the pig roast, and obviously some wine and just had a great time. Got to meet all kinds of really new and interesting people and talk about the history of the place, and the actual, the region, the Loire valley, which is just famous for castles and for wine, very historic area in France.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Mm, that sounds nice! </p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><strong><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Todd: </font></strong><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">OK, Mike, I was wondering, you're from Canada, and you have lived in America, and we work together, and in our company everybody is American but you, so how would you say Canadians are different than Americans? </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mike: </strong>Well, first of all, I'll just, to be honest, just to start, I'll say that Canadians and Americans I think share a lot more similar qualities than they do differences, I mean, I think Canadians have a lot more in common with Americans than they do with even with English people who are like from Britain who were the original sort of Canadians, I suppose, a few hundred years ago, so in that way I think that like again, just to preempt it by saying we're very similar, however, there's definitely some differences I think between Americans and Canadians. First of all, I think Canadians in general are maybe a little bit more humble. Not to put this in a negative way, but they just, they're not as willing to engage in an argument, or to argue over a point, I think, as you know, as most, at least, most of my American friends, who’ll want to debate and get to the bottom of a topic. Canadians would rather just sort of back off and say, you know, ""That's, you're right. That's fine. Great"" but again, </font><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">and I can't speak for all Canadians because it depends on your personality too, but just to generalize, that's one difference. Also, I would say that Americans in general tend to be a lot more businesslike and maybe even a little more conservative in, just in the way they, in the way that they, I guess, view, relations, or view discussions with people, but Canadians tend to be a little bit more liberal, a little bit more free and easy-going, again, I'll preempt that by saying all of the Americans that I work with I think are quite liberal and not conservative thinking at all, but if you want to generalize, yeah, culturally, then I think those are probably a couple of differences between the two cultures, or people in the cultures. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Todd: </font></strong>Yeah, anything else, any other differences? </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mike<font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">: </font></strong>Well, I think, one thing that Americans tend to point to with Canadians, and it is true to some extent, other than our love of hockey, is sense of humor. I think Canadians in general tend to have a, I wouldn't say unique, but they just tend to look at I guess, look at things with a little bit more of, a bit of humor, too it, and I think the main reason for that is cause it's so bloody cold in Canada.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Todd: </font></strong>Fair enough. Thanks Mike.</font></p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, Mike, you are from Canada.</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>That's right.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, actually I want to go to Canada for vacation. I've never been. What would you recommend for a Canadian vacation? </p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Well, it really just depends on the kind of holiday that you want to have. If you want to have a relaxing outdoors, kind of back to nature, kind of holiday, I'd recommend Vancouver. If you wanted to do a holiday that's maybe a little more culturally oriented. If you want experience, a different type of culture, Montreal, would be a city that I'd recommend, um, and if you wanted to go to a big multi-cultural city with a lot of nightlife and things to do with respect to entertainment, or sports, then I'd recommend Toronto.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, have you been to all three cities?</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yes. I actually have lived most of my life in Toronto and in Montreal and, but I have spent some time in Vancouver as well, so, all three are very different in attitude and lifestyle and in the way people live.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>How so? How is somebody from Toronto different than somebody from Vancouver? </p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Well, somebody from Toronto I think is a little bit more high paced, maybe you could almost say, they're a little bit more stresses out, just because the pace of life in Toronto is a little bit faster. It's kind of the big economic center of Canada, so it tend to have a lot more of a business culture to it, where as Vancouver, is much more, like many West Coast cities in the United States, as well, it's a lot more relaxed, a lot more easy-going, so there's a difference in culture there,and Montreal has a strong French-Canadian influence, so in fact, it's mostly French-Canadian, so that just changes the dynamic of the city. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, so if you were to live in any city, which one would you choose?</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Of, those three? (Yeah) Personally I would think I would go for Montreal, just because I like the dynamic. The one bad point about Montreal is the weather.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>What? It's very cold?</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yes, it gets very, very cold and it has a very long winter. In fact, the joke is that in Montreal the seasons are nine month of winter and three months of bad-skating.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, well, thanks, Mike.</p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, Simon, I see you have today's paper.</p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Yes, I read the paper every day.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So today do we have good news or bad news? </p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, world news is always bad, and for me sports is always good, sports news, but I felt an earthquake yesterday and so, I've basically l ooked at the headlines today first and just to see if the earthquake was in the paper, and it was.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Nobody died did they?</p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>I don't think so, but for me it felt quite strong.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Actually, speaking of papers, I love the paper, and I read it every day, but there is one thing that I hate about the newspaper, and that's you read all the stories on the front page and then they stop, they're cut in half, and then you have to go to the middle of the paper to finish, and it just drives me nuts because I take the train to work every day and the train is so crowded sometimes I can't actually turn the paper, fold the paper to get to story on the inside, so I have to wait until I get to work, so I read six stories, seven stories half way and I have to wait till later to find out the ending.</p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, that's terrible. I do something similar. I, when I, I take also, I also take a busy train in the morning, and I just read the front page, and the back page. The front page has the headlines, the back page has the sports, and then when I get to work, if I have free time I just open up and finish the story that I read. (Yeah) I have a question, what do you prefer, do you prefer the tabloid style paper, which opens up like a book and you read each page, like a book, or do you prefer the traditional paper where, which is all folded neatly and into sections, like A B C D.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Um, that's a good point, I guess, or a good question, uh, I guess I'm used to the old traditional style but I have to admit, the tabloid style is a lot more convenient, um, so I wouldn't mind if my paper changed to that style. (OK) What do you prefer?</p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, I prefer the tabloid, just because it's easier to read.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>The only thing I don't like about some tabloids is that they put a lot of colors on the paper and it's not as easy to read as the more traditional papers I think. </p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, the other meaning of tabloid is the kind of newspaper that prints just glossy stories with pictures and usually celebrity news, that's not really world news, or sports or anything but about Micheal Jackon's trial or what celebrity got which hair cut, so that's a different kind of tabloid, but yeah. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So do you subscribe to the newspaper or just buy one every day?</p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>I buy one every day because I sometimes buy a different papers. </p> <p><br /></p>               "

It's dry at least, so I quite like winter days that are sunny like today. I was outside and even though at first it seems quite cold, afterwards, with the sun we kind of warmed up very quickly.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, it was nice today, but winter is not my favorite season. No, I want winter to be over very quickly. But soon spring will be here and spring is good. I like spring, and then summer. I love summer. Summer is my favorite season.</p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>Really? Even when it's really, really hot?</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, I love it! Last year, it was really, really hot and everybody, every day would complain, and say it was so hot, but I loved it. The hotter the better. I think it's very relaxing and it calms me down actually. I feel calm and very relaxed in very hot weather. </p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>I quite like hot weather as well, but last summer, the summer you are talking about, I had to go on a very crowded train every morning, so when you have a crowded train, and it's very, very hot, it ends up being quite disgusting, piled in against all these sweaty people, so I didn't like last summer for that reason.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, what's your favorite season?</p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>Ah, autumn is my favorite season, cause I think, because every autumn I start at school. It always feels like a new beginning, time of year, for me, more so than January. I feel like September is a good time to change things and a good time to start new things, and also the trees are beautiful and the weather is quite mild and nice. How about you? What's your favorite season?</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, it's probably a tie between summer and fall, for what you just said, I agree. The fall has great weather, the trees are beautiful, it's a good time to be outside. It rarely rains, and I hate the rain and plus, my birthday is in October, and Halloween which is a fun holiday. </p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>Right, that's good.</p> <p><br /></p>               "

The city is on a peninsula so it is surrounded by water, with the Pacific Ocean on one side and San Francisco Bay on the other.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">The most famous landmark in San Francisco is probably the Golden Gate Bridge which is one of the longest suspension bridges in the world. The bridge was completed in 1937 and is still widely used today. The bridge has an Art Deco design and unique orange color, making it not only practical, but beautiful as well.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Another famous landmark with an Art Deco design is Coit Tower, which is 210 feet tall and sits atop Telegraph Hill. The tower was designed to look like a fire hose nozzle in memory to the many brave firemen who battled the Great San Francisco Fire from the 1906 earthquake.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">In San Francisco, even the prisons are unique.

"                                  <p>One of my hobbies is running. I really like running because first of all it's very cheap. It doesn't cost you any money. You can do it anywhere, for example, on a city street and it's a healthy hobby. If you run a lot, maybe three or four times a week, you will definitely stay in shape. </p> <p>My favorite time to go running is in the morning, because in the morning it's nice and quiet, peaceful outside. You can see the sun coming up. Feel the cool air on your face, and of course you can hear birds chirping, sometimes a rooster crowing. It's just a really cool time to be outside. </p> <p>Whenever possible, I try to run outside in nature. It's best for your body to run on dirt, so if you can find a dirt trail, or maybe a wide open space of dirt, that's usually the place to run because running a lot on concrete, or pavement will hurt your knees. </p> <p>Like I said, running is very, very cheap, but you should invest money in a good pair of running shoes. A good pair of running shoes will make it easier and less painful to run, and can save you a lot of damage on your body, especially your knees. </p> <p>When you run it's very important to drink lots of water. You should drink a lot of water before you run, perhaps 500 milligrams (ml), and then maybe you should drink a little when you run, if you run for more than 30 minutes. And then of course you should drink some water as soon as you finish your run to rehydrate your body. If you don't, you'll get really bad headaches. </p> <p>Naturally, stretching is very important, but most people actually stretch before they run. Often this isn't as important as stretching after you run. I like to stretch after I run because it helps your muscles build up quicker and recuperate, and you'll just feel really good. </p> <p><br /></p>               "

First of all, when children are young, they're starting to be creative for the first time. So, just by choosing what they're going to wear every day, they're can show their creativity, or their individuality, you know? Also, it helps students learn to make choices, to make decisions, to make decisions for themselves. I don't know, like a uniform you take that away from children.</p> <p><strong>Marion:</strong> I think they can learn how to choose in other ways, maybe, I don't know the accesories they wear, but basically that everybody is in the same clothes I think is really good, just to make everybody equal. Did you wear a uniform when you were at school?</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> No I didn't. And looking back, I'm glad I didn't, because you know, your clothes reflect your personality, and I think that it's important for kids to be able to show how they are as a person, through their clothes.</p> <p><strong>Marion:</strong> But maybe if you can show your personality through your personality, and you don't need your clothes to show your personality, then that's a bit better, I think.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's a good point. I guess I just can't imagine wearing a uniform every day. Plus, I mean if you wear a uniform every day it must get really old, really repetitive, the same thing again and again and again. And I think that mentally, that can be tiring.</p> <p><strong>Marion:</strong> I think that it might be tiring, or worrying mentally if you, for example, if you see other children in your school who have nicer clothes, more expensive clothes, and your parents can't afford those kind of clothes. Then, it makes you feel left out when you're a child, and that's really, really awful if you feel that way as a child, just because of clothes and money I think.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, did you wear a uniform?</p> <p><strong>Marion:</strong> Yes. </p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Did you feel that way?</p> <p><strong>Marion:</strong> I went to school in Ireland, so almost all schools have uniforms, so for us it felt very normal, that when I was in primary school we had a uniform, and then in secondary school a different uniform, and my brother's school had a uniform, so it's normal for us. So, I thought it was OK, sometimes you do get bored, but I think overall it saved us time in the morning, which is good. </p>               "
"                 <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Hi! What's your name?</p> <p><strong>Nathan: </strong>My name is Nathan Curtis Gildard. Well, my name is Nathan but people call me Nate, so.</p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>OK. What do you do in your free time?</p> <p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I do a lot of different things. I like to travel around, I like to go to places I've never been. I like to play guitar in a band, which I'm not in right now. I like to play soccer. I play soccer a lot, and I play futsal too. </p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Futsal, what's that?</p> <p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Futsal is a 5 a side soccer game, so it's played on a small court about the size of a basketball court, and the ball is smaller than a soccer ball, it's kind of heavy, and you have five people so there are 4 players and one keeper, goalie. </p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, interesting. Is it similar to soccer in other ways?</p> <p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Well, it's similar in ways that you pass the ball but it's different in ways that for example you have a stop clock in the international futsal games, and professional games, so there's a stop clock. The way you move around is very different, you know, you have positions like midfield, forward, defense, but often a defender can find themselves playing forward which is kind of fun because defenders get a chance to score too. </p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>OK, here is the last question, which do you prefer, soccer or the big football or futsal?</p> <p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Ah, that's a difficult question. I think at the moment I enjoy futsal a little bit more because it is a harder pace. You're running a lot faster. There's more chances to score. It's a really challenging game. It takes a lot of energy, and the five guys that you play with, there's only five people so you really depend on each other to do well so it's a real team sport. You really need each other. </p> <p><strong>Simon: </strong>Thank you.</p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "

We used to go together once every week, I think it was Wednesday, and have a class.</p> <p>In yoga it's very important to stretch your body, so you have to reach down to touch your toes for example, or stretch out your arms or legs, like that.</p> <p>Another part of yoga is when you have to practice balancing. For example when you stand on just one leg, and you have to keep standing, even though it's a bit difficult sometimes, because you feel like you might fall over.</p> <p>At the end of yoga class, usually, you have a few minutes just to relax, so you lie down on the floor, on your back. You let your legs and arms become loose and relaxed and it feels very, very calm and peaceful. Sometimes, people even fall asleep.</p> <p> </p> <p><br /></p>               "

On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, you can leave your burnable trash outside.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>What is burnable trash?</p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>Burnable trash is for example, milk cartons, other paper things, and food as well. You can put all the remains of your food in the burnable bin. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, so burnable trash is Monday, Wednesday, Friday.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>That's right.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, what about the other trash?</p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>OK, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, you can leave your unburnable trash outside your door. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, what is unburnable trash?</p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>Unburnable trash is for example, plastic. So you can't burn plastic, so non burnable, or unburnable. So plastic for example, other things that would harm the environment, if you were to burn them.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, what about plastic bottles?</p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>That's on Saturday, as well, so you can leave plastic PET bottles and also glass bottles, but in a separate bin. You can leave all those bottles on Saturday, as well.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, anything else, like batteries, or clothing?</p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>Yes, for batteries and clothing there are special days every month, so you have to keep them until maybe one day, or two days in the month when you can leave out things like batteries or clothes, or bigger things. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, and where do I put the trash?</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>You have to put all the trash in clear plastic bags and leave them just outside your apartment. Just over there, on the left. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK. Thanks Marion. </p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>You're welcome.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>I might have to ask you again, but thanks.</p> <p><strong>Marion: </strong>Don't worry.

"                                  <p>When I was a little girl, I used to knit all the time. I used to knit jumpers and hats and scarves. I even used to knit little dolls sometimes: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs for example.</p> <p>When you knit with two needles you can put the thread or the wool around your needles in different ways, so that you get different patterns in the wool. So in this picture for example, you have two different stitches. The one on the left is called ""rib stitch"" and the one on the right is called pearl stitch. Yesterday I started to knit a scarf for myself. The wool is dark green and it's in rib stitch. Until today I've knitted four balls of wool, but I think I will need ten all together, because it is going to be a very big scarf to help keep me warm this winter.</p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                                  <p>The Australian flag has the Union Jack in the top left-hand corner. The rest of the flag is dark blue and then it has six white stars on it. I think they represent six different states in Australia, but I'm not really sure.</p> <p>My favorite city in Australia is Sydney. I lived there for about 6 months and it's a really lively city. There are lots of young people and lots of things to do. There are also lots of tourist sites to visit, for example, the Sydney Opera House.</p> <p>Most people when they think about Australia, they think about the Outback. Very few people in Australia live in the Outback really, which is why it is so empty. There are huge empty spaces, like deserts, sometimes, where you can go for hours without seeing even one other person. </p> <p>When I was in the Outback, the most amazing sight I saw was Ayers Rock, or Uluru as it's called now, which is its Aboriginal name. So Uluru is the biggest rock in the world, and it really is amazing when you travel through the Outback and then suddenly, out of nowhere, you see a huge rock that looks like a mountain. It's an amazing sight, one of the best I saw in Australia.</p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                                  <p>There are many dangerous animals in Australia like the crocodile for example. When I was in Australia I saw many crocodiles when I was in the north and they did look very scary with their big jaws and lots of teeth. It was quite scary. We saw them from a boat, so I felt quite safe.</p> <p>Another animal that exists in Australia is the spider. There are lots of different kinds of spiders, and lots of different colors. While I was there I saw red spiders, green spiders, yellow spiders, white spiders and also the ordinary brown and black spiders. They were very colorful in Australia.</p> <p>So there are lots of dangerous animals, but the ones I prefer are the cute animals, like the kangaroo. You see kangaroos all over Australia. There are many, many kangaroos, almost everywhere you go, except for the cities of course. You can see big kangaroos, called red kangaroos, and they are very tall, taller than a person and brown kangaroos and grey kangaroos and then quite small kangaroos which might be brown with black legs for example. They're very cute.</p> <p>My favorite Australian animal, though, is the koala. The koala only eats leaves from the eucalyptus tree. That's all the koala eats all day, so it doesn't have very much energy, as you can imagine, because it only eats leaves. So most of the times you see a koala, they are very quiet and they look a bit lazy, but I think they're really, really cute and one time when I was in Australia I had the chance to hold a koala, so that was a great experience for me and the koala feels quite soft but its hair is quite hard at the same time but my little koala was really, really cute.</p> <p><br /></p>               "

The weather was warm every day. It was sunny every day and the temperature was almost 80 degrees. I visited my mother and I spent every morning having a nice leisurely cup of coffee and reading the newspaper and after that I got my bicycle out and and rode down to the beach and enjoyed the sun and the surf, ah, came back home and read a book and went to bed early.<br /></p> I had a wonderful time. I saw a couple of new movies, when I was home in Florida. I saw The Aviator and also an interesting movie called Spanglish, which I hope you all can see because it's an interesting movie about English and the Spanish. <p><br /></p>               "

What is the movie about?</p><p><strong>Howard: </strong>Well, ""The Aviator"" refers to the character, Howard Hughes.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, who was Howard Hughes?</p><p><strong>Howard: </strong>Well, Howard Hughes is a very famous person in the United States. He was a flyer, first of all, and he was a producer of movies and he was a little crazy. The interesting part of his character, although he was a very brilliant thinker, and a great aviator, he had a kind of obsession with cleanliness, which actually drove him crazy in his later life. </p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Really, so he always wanted to be super clean. </p><p><strong>Howard: </strong>Super clean! He hated germs and he went to extraordinary lengths to keep himself and all his surrounding clean. If anybody touched him, he had to wash many times to get all the germs off of him, and he was just, it became such an obsession that it interfered with his entire personal life.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow! What about you? Are you very clean? Do you worry about germs?</p><p><strong>Howard: </strong>No not really. I don't think so.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, actually, if you're eating M&M's and one falls off your hand and hits the floor, would you pick it up real quick and still eat it, or would you not eat it?</p><p><strong>Howard: </strong>It depends if I had cleaned the floor lately.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, but overall, back to the movie, was it a good movie?</p><p><strong>Howard: </strong>Ah, yes. In fact, it's been nominated for a number of Academy Awards, and I think this year, it will do quite well. It's entertaining and it's well performed by Leonardo DiCaprio, although I think that Leonardo DiCaprio is a little young for the part but he did a very good job in his acting.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Hmm, OK, thanks. Maybe I'll see it.</p><p><strong>Howard: </strong>Try!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>                 "

There are different challenges, I mean any marriage has got challenges, and just having different cultures and different backgrounds and different languages, despite the fact that we both speak both our first languages. Yeah, it has different challenges but that makes it fun.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> You said that your wife speaks to you in Japanese and you speak to her in English?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> No it’s fifty-fifty really. It really depends on what we’re talking about: if we’re watching an English movie or something on TV in English we’ll speak in English; if we’re reading the Japanese newspaper and we find something interesting we will probably speak in Japanese.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ok, well, actually, how did you meet?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> Through my room mate in Japan, how many years ago now, probably about 15 years ago…</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> A while back</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> …introduced us. Yeah, it’s been a long time.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> That’s cool. Is there anything that’s hard about having an international marriage?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> I suppose it means that you’re always away from one person’s family. I suppose that’s the hardest thing. I’m in Japan now so I’m a long way from my family; when we lived in New Zealand before, my wife was a long way from her family.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> That’s tough, that is tough. So how long did you live together in New Zealand?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> We were there for about 4 years,…I think. Yeah, yeah, approximately 4 years in New Zealand.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, have you lived in any other countries together?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> No, no, not together, it’s either been Japan or New Zealand.<br /></font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Do you have any plans as to which country you’re going to settle in?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> Now that sounds very permament to me!</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>So you never know?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> Never know.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Alright, thanks a lot, Mark.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Hey, er, Mark, could you tell me about the first job you ever had?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> I think it was when I was at university, well my first long term part time job was when I was at university and one night a week I used to work for 12 hours from 6 pm ‘til 6am in a printing factory and we were actually making television guides to be distributed throughout the whole country.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So you worked from 6am, I mean 6pm ‘til 6am?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> Yep, overnight. I felt that it was probably better to work just one long block of time than rather have a part time job 2 or 3 nights a week. So I kept that up for 2, 2and a half years until my final year of university. Then I decided that study on Friday was more important than the part time job, but for 2 and a half years I really enjoyed it.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So for this job what exactly did you do? What were your duties?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> We used to take the TV guides from the printing presses and bundle them up and get them ready for distribution to the various convenience stores and gas stands and bookstores throughout the whole country and then make sure that each or the shops and regions got the right number of guides.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So a job like that would be manual labour, versus say a customer service job where you are always talking with people. Which type of job do you think is more enjoyable for a young person?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> Because of the hours we worked, it was all overnight, there was a combination of other university students and also quite a few housewives who were doing it for extra income, so we actually had quite a good team. There were probably 10 to15 of us. We used to enjoy a good laugh while we were doing it as well.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Sounds fun!</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> It was tiring, especially lectures on Friday mornings but we used to stay awake.

What’s that?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> ‘The big overseas experience’ or ‘the big overseas excursion’. So, a lot of people, when they finish school or finish university, they <span class=""audionotes""><a href=""../../Audio/N0451/498-2-take-a-year-off.mp3"">take a year off</a></span> and because New Zealand is located a long way from anywhere, instead of taking a trip from one country to another for a week, like many Europeans do, when young New Zealanders travel they tend to go backpacking a lot, get a part time job working in a pub or a restaurant in London to make more money and then they will travel for 3 or 4 months through Europe. They may go back to England and work a bit more and then see a few more countries, and then maybe after a year or so they’ll start <span class=""audionotes""><a href=""../../Audio/N0451/498-3-heading-back.mp3"">heading back</a></span> towards home. That’s ‘the big OE’. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So did you do ‘the big OE’?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> Sort of, yeah. After I’d finished work at…after I’d finished university I worked for a few months and yes, I did go to England. I’d applied for a job and then hadn’t heard back so I started my OE and I did it for a few months and then I actually found out I’d got a job, so I <span class=""audionotes""><a href=""../../Audio/N0451/498-4-cut-short.mp3"">cut the OE short</a></span> to join the working world.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ok, what countries besides London are popular for Kiwis to go and visit?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> Um, now…</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Or what cities or places?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Mark:</strong> Now I think they’re getting more adventurous. Before it used to be very <span class=""audionotes""><a href=""../../Audio/N0451/498-5-euro-centric.mp3"">euro-centric</a></span>, but now a lot more people are going through Asia and going to more exotic locations: maybe South America, some people travel to Africa. <span class=""audionotes""><a href=""../../Audio/N0451/498-6-old-ties.mp3"">The old ties to England</a></span> are still there; I think that’s still the first location for many people: save a bit of money and then see the rest of the world.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "

They call them ‘batches’ in the north of the island or ‘cribs’ in the south island. And you just spend 4, 5 days, maybe a week, 2 weeks, just swimming in the sea, playing in the sand dunes, walks in the forest: just a really relaxing time with family and family friends.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> That sounds nice, so you know in Australia they’re really <span class=""audionotes""><a href=""../../Audio/N0451/497-1-big-on-surfing.mp3"">big on surfing</a></span>.

OK. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy:</strong> So, yes. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> And what kind of movies have you been able to put into use?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy:</strong> Oh, gosh, recently we've added ""War of the World's"".</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Oh, the H.G. Wells classic.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy:</strong> Yes, the new Speilberg version. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve: </strong>Oh, OK. OK.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy:</strong> Yes. Yes.

OK.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy:</strong> It looks like a fun trailer.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Excellent. Yeah. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy:</strong> Ah, various genres, too, like computer animation or love stories or action (OK. OK) Yeah something for everybody. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Yeah, and who, which type of people have been accessing the website, and who's getting the most from it?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy: </strong>Ah, people from all over the world are going now. I've had people e-mail about this site from over 25 different countries, so it's very international.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Excellent. Excellent. And how long have you had this website up?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy:</strong> Almost three years now. (Yeah) I guess, yeah about three years. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Wow. OK. It sounds extremely interesting. I'll be very much looking forward to having a look at it myself. How can I access this website?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Andy:</strong> The URL is www.english-trailers.com</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> OK, sounds great, Andy, Good luck with it. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Steven, I thought we would have a friendly debate. What do you think is the best sport in the world?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> The best sport in the world is unquestionably what is know in America as soccer, what is know in my country as football.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, well, we'll call it football. I think football's good. I think football's good. It's a good sport, but I'm sorry, it's just not as good as baseball.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Really, I'm quite surprised to hear you say that because you did mention, I believe the question was ""the best sport in the world"" (Yes) whereas baseball isn't as nearly as widely appreciated worldwide as football is. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, that's true. That's true. I will give you that, but a lot of countries do play baseball, it's popular in Asia (they do indeed, yeah) and Central America, and in North America, and it's a young sport. You just got to give it time. We need more time to come around. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve: </strong>Yeah, I don't have anything in particular against kids playing baseball. I think getting kids out playing any sport is very healthy and it very good thing to happen, but I got to say, I mean for young kids, particularly in developing countries where they perhaps need a lot more equipment to play baseball, I think soccer is much more accessible than baseball. They only need a ball, a field, a street even before they can get started. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, that's kind of true, but I mean in baseball you just need a stick and a rock.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Yeah you could do like that, yeah.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> But I mean, one thing that I think how baseball is better than football is that in baseball it's more democratic in that everybody has to bat. You can't have a prima donna star. I mean you can have stars, but everyone's gotta swing the bat, and you know, in soccer if you're a fullback, if I'm using that correctly, you play back by the goal, you know, you're kind of just lagging back there. You're not gonna score or anything. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Yeah, that's very, very true and I think you're very right in saying that baseball is indeed a democratic sport, but I think soccer gives each individual player to play to his own strengths, his own physical capabilities, for example you have people who are naturally strong presence who are more suited to, well, playing defense, whereas your speedier players, and your slightly more cunning players lends itself to being a striker, so it really allows people to specialize and the crowd really get behind that. The crowd really appreciate a good strong defender and a nifty striker who gets in there and poaches a lot of goals for his team.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, that's true. Those are some good points, but in baseball you have to utilize more skills. I mean, you have to be skilled at catching the ball (Yes), throwing the ball (Yes), hitting the ball (Yeah), running the bases (yeah), you know, football you just got to run and kick (Yeah).</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> But I mean, to be honest with you, baseball, that's not really doing anything that cricket never did, for example. All those skills were employed in a sport that was invented way, way much longer ago than baseball ever was.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> That is true. You got me on that one, so anyway. well, I like football, but I just, I have to stick with baseball. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> That's fine. I think we can agree to disagree. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Steven, where did you go to college?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> I went to the University of Wales, um, the College of Cardiff there, so it the United Kingdom, obviously we have England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland and so I spent three years over in Wales. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow. Sounds fun. So what's university like in Wales? Is it different than University life in Britain?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Yeah, it is. Um, for example Wales has it's own distinguished, distinctive language and culture as well, so if you go to Wales you'll see street signs written not only in English, but above that you'll have the Welsh language there and Welsh people are very, very proud of their language, and their heritage and there culture and it made it just a slightly different experience from studying over the border in England.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So they speak Welsh? Is that the language?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> That's correct. Yeah. Yeah, they do. It's not spoken by everybody in Wales. Since the middle ages, the usage of the language has declined somewhat but there has been a revival over the last 30 or 40 years, and now about, maybe about 40% of the Welsh population speak it as either as their first of second language.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Did you learn it while you there?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> No, no, I didn't, no. Everybody speaks English there. but there is a lot of good music coming out in Welsh now. There's lots of cultural festivals and when I was at Cardiff, there's lots of pubs where it's Welsh speaking only and it was quite good fun to go in there and try to order a beer and stuff in the Welch language, but that was about as far as I got. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Could you say that there's any, it's a stereo type, that's there's any difference between the Welsh people and the British people?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> There is yeah, because they've had a different history and obviously that affects how people have evolved over many centuries. They like different sports for example. They're more into rugby than they are into football. They tend to look slightly different than they do to English people. They tend to have sort of redder hair and darker eyes than English people, but also they're very, very loyal, they're very, very fierce, they're very passionate people. They're very nice people.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, it sounds like a nice place to go. I'd love to go someday.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steve:</strong> Yeah it was nice! <br /></font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Hello! Can you introduce yourself please.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Sure, my name is Steven Patterson and I'm from a small town called Brentwood in Essex which is in England.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. Essex. What part of England is that?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> That's in the southeast.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Southeast.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Yeah, yeah. It's attached to London, just next to London. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, OK, but you said it's a small town.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> It's quite small, well, relatively small. The populations about 50,000. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, well what kind of place is your town where you grew up? </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Um, it's actually a very nice town. People often move into Brentwood from the surrounding towns, or from the east end of London. Um, it's quite prosperous. Well, you could, in some respects, it's a dormant town. People often travel out from Brentwood into London and they work in the city, but it's a pleasant place to live. It has lots of countryside around it. There's a very large country park. Ah, it's quite a small town but it's, at the high street it's quite small but it's quite a pleasant town to shop in.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, it sounds nice. Well, now if you live in a little town that's near London is it really expensive?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Well, Brentwood is particularly expensive just because it's a desirable place to live and it's proximity to London also makes it, the housing is quite expensive, even a town next to it would have much cheaper housing. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, really, cause when I think of a small British village, you know, I think of really old houses, and nothing's changed, so do you have modern stuff, like do you have a health club and a movie theater and things like that?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Uh, I think the cinema in Brentwood actually closed down, with the advent of out of town shopping centers they always have their multiplex cinemas with six or eight screens and the cinema in Brentwood only had two screens and it couldn't really compete for everyone has cars these days so they can easily travel to big shopping centers, so that closed down however, yeah, it have a very nice health center and as I said lots of parks to play. There's lots of opportunity to exercise and do various forms of recreation.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow, sounds like a nice place to live.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Now Steven, I'm single and, but you are married and you are a father, correct?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> That is correct, yeah. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. I'm just curious. What is it like being a father?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Ah, right. OK, well, I think if I first of all talk about what it was like not being a father, being me and not being a father. I think I used to make the most of my free time, well in fact I didn't make the most of my free time. I was a very lazy person. I was an incredible time waster, so I would have all of this free time to make use of and I would probably just sit in front of the TV, or I'd probably go to a pub and drink, but anyway I took my time for granted. I thought I have this time. It wasn't such a precious thing for me. I had so much of it.<br /> Once I became a father, suddenly my time disappeared but strangely enough, now that I've become a father and I've, it's taught me to appreciate the time I have. My time is now very limited. My work has become busier but I actually make much more use of my time now than when I did so much of it. It's kind of strange.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>And how many children do you have?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Ah, two. BOys, </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, two boys. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Yep, they're both still very young. They keep us very busy. The eldest is four and the youngest is three.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow!</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> So they need, they still need quite a lot of attention.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, so when you first have kids do you lose a lot of sleep? I'm always worried that I won't be able to sleep. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Well, something that carried over from my previous lifestyle was an ability to sleep very well, and, um, fortunately I have a very understanding wife so if the children woke up, yeah, well because I had to work my wife was, my wife tended to be responsible. She would look after the children if they woke up during the evening, during the night, sorry, and I'm such a good sleeper that even if they were crying incredibly loudly I could just go back to sleep. I don't think there are many fathers like me. I've spoken to some other fathers and they don't have the same talent as I do. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, well, thanks Steven.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""></font></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Steven, if I go to England, and I can choose between Manchester, and Liverpool, (right) and London (right) those are the only three major cities I know, which one would you say is the best?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Out of those three, well I would have to say London. I&#39;ve never actually been to Liverpool so I can&#39;t comment on Liverpool. I have spent a short time in Manchester before. Uh, I enjoyed Manchester. It&#39;s a very lively city. It has lots of good clubs and it has some interesting shopping, there&#39;s some interesting shopping in Manchester, uh, there&#39;s some good markets, but I&#39;ve actually lived in London and I feel like my heart is in London. I feel like a Londoner, and London has everything to offer. Again if you, I&#39;m not particularly into clubs but if you&#39;re interested in clubbing then there are great clubs. There are some good pubs. Um, it has the theatres, hundreds of cinemas. The architecture is fantastic.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, what about in London there&#39;s many parts, right, so if I do go to London what part of London is the best place to go and stay.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Um, it depends on what you want to do. If you want to, if you want, if you want to see the sites then well you&#39;d want to, you&#39;d obviously want to stay centrally, I&#39;d have thought. Um, most of the famous landmarks are in the center. However, if you&#39;re going to spend some time living in London, and if you want to experience maybe a more, just an ordinary side of London, then you can live a bit further out. I actually lived in the south of London, just below Brixton, maybe you know Brixton. I lived in an area called Strettom, and the atmosphere there is very lively, also very lively. I enjoyed South London. In the past South London had a bad reputation. People didn&#39;t think South London was a very nice place to live, but over the last few years the quality of life in South London is improved, has improved a lot. More and more people are moving in to South London and, well, consequently, as a result the prices are going up and up and up, but it&#39;s actually a nice, a nice area to live in, in South London I think. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, sounds good. Thanks.</font></p>"
"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Steven, you're from Europe, you're from England. (Yep) Have you travelled much in England? I'm sorry, have you travelled much in Europe?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Ah, yes I have, yeah. Um, when I was 18 and 20 I travelled all around Europe by train.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, wow, sounds fun. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Ah, it's great, so basically backpacking, but going between countries by train with some friends. I travelled with some friends, so you can buy one ticket. It's called an interrail ticket and you can visit any country in Europe using this one ticket. They last, well, the ticket I had lasted one month.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> That's a good deal. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> So, we went to France and we travelled to Italy and then we went down to some Greek islands. Also we went to Amsterdam in Holland.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow! What did you do in France?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> In France we were on the South Coast, South of France. What did we do? Well, really we spent our time on the beach mainly playing water sports on the beach and just sunbathing and relaxing. (Cool) That kind of thing. Yep.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, did you make it to Sardegna?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Sardegna...no</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Or Corsica? I'm sorry. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> No, no we didn't. Nope.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Um, I think my favorite city was probably Florence in Italy.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, OK. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> We were lucky, We met some students, some British students who was studying Italian, and they had their own apartment on the hills, one of the hills in Florence, and they invited us to their apartment, so we stayed with them, and they had, they had built up some local knowledge. They knew about some local restaurants so they took us to a very traditional, whatchucallem, piatza, uh pizza restaurant, pizze, pizzu (Pizzeria!) Thank you. Yes. Um, and I think it was the best pizza I've ever had. It was wonderful. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>I'm hungry now too.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> And they even took us to a communist festival, which was in the mountain and we played five a side football, at a communist festival which was quite a unique experience.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> How bizarre. How bizarre.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> After some tequila. It was great. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Florence was your favorite city. Was Italy you're favorite country?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Steven:</strong> Ah, I think so. I love the Tuscany area. Yeah, it's absolutely beautiful. Hard to beat.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, wish I could do it again. </font></p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "

"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Hey, Akane, I was reading in the paper that China is doing research on genetically modified foods and is considering it. The United States is for using genetically modified foods, (I see) but Europe is against it. (Oh, right) So you&#39;re from Canada, what do you think?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, I think it&#39;s a great idea. to have genetically modified foods.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Why?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, I think that especially for countries like China research shows that the people in China,<br />the quality of their life is going to be of the level of the people in America within the next thirty years, and if this world is going to support that kind of population, we definitely need more resources in order to make food to support the population.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Do you worry more that maybe there haven&#39;t been enough tests on genetically modified foods, that there might be side effects that could lead to cancer, or could maybe ruin the naturally life cycle of the plants?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Uh, definitely, I think there is lots of reasons to be concerned and that&#39;s why the research has to be taken carefully and slowly and there has to be laws and procedures in place so that the research is controlled and that foods are tested before people can use them.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, you&#39;re saying that they should do research but it&#39;s OK to go ahead and try to use it now?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, if there is reason to think that it is safe after many tests then, then I think we should start using it for the future.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Mm, I mean, I can understand why people would want to use genetically modified foods because in terms of drought or insects eating the plants or feeding really impoverished areas like Africa and parts of Asia (Right) it&#39;s useful but we really don&#39;t know, I mean, aren&#39;t you a little bit worried that if you rush it you don&#39;t give enough time for the tests, you know, if it&#39;s really harmful to the environment or the people.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> For sure, so I don&#39;t think we should rush it, but at the same time I don&#39;t think we should completely stop the research, either because the fact is the population is growing and these people are going to have to eat food so if genetically modified foods can help people to eat and survive and for the human population to survive then we&#39;re going to have to continue with the research.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> That&#39;s a pretty solid argument. I pretty much agree with you on that.<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Thanks<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, thanks, Akane.</font></p><p></p><p></p>"
"                          <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Ruthie, what did you do today?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Well, I got up quite early this morning, actually, to go shopping.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, yeah! (Yeah) Ooh, shopping.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> I really like shopping.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>That's true but you're on a budget. You're trying to save money.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> I know, but is was my brother's birthday. Well, it is my brother's birthday in a week so.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, no kidding.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yeah.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, what did you get your brother for his birthday?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Well, it was quite difficult to find something that I thought he would like, but I got him some cakes in the end, some Japanese cakes.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Japanese cakes?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yeah, they're in like a special presentation box.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, how are you going to get the cakes to your brother? Just through the post office?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yes, I sent them in the post this morning.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, did you send them express or just regular mail?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>No, regular mail because it was cheaper.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> But, don't you want it to hurry and get there for his birthday?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> I've got one week. I think it will get there in time.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, what do you think you're brother will think of the cakes?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> I don't think he'll like them actually.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> No?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Well, he likes chocolate cake, and they look like they've got kind of chocolate inside but it's bean paste. I think he'll be disappointed.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So what did you brother get you for your last birthday?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> That's a good question. He always gives me money, and he often gives me chocolate as well. He's very generous. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Actually, I'm the same way. Guys like to give money. Money is so easy. No shopping involved.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> It's practical, though, it's good.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, I've been told that when you give money for a gift, it's actually very impolite. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Really?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Is that true? Yeah!</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Why is that?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> I don't know. Some people say it's just really impersonal. That you should take the time to get a gift.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Really! I really think if anybody gave me money I would be so pleased. It's a good present.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Exactly, that's what I think. (Pause) Hey, um, actually, when are you going to see your brother next?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Probably, I will see him in August of September.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, that's quite a ways away.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yes, about four months is that.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So is this a younger brother or older brother?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> He's older. He's twenty-six. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, he's twenty six.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> He's going to be twenty-six soon.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ok, well, if you happen to e-mail him, tell him happy birthday. </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh, certainly will do. Thanks.</font></p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Hey, so Ruth, how do you get your news?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh, I buy a newspaper.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really, what paper do you read?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> I always read the Guardian.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> The Guardian. Is that conservative or liberal?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s labor. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Labor. So the Labor newspaper, the Guardian, what angle do they have? Like in the States you&#39;d say it&#39;s either conservative, like the Wall street Journal, or it&#39;s liberal, like the New York Times.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> OK, it would be more like the New York Times. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, like the New York Times. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yeah. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Actually, I don&#39;t even read papers anymore?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> What!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> I mean, I read them online, but I just prefer to get everything on the internet.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> So, you just read the newspaper on the internet?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Pretty much. Yeah, I never pay for a paper paper anymore.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> What! Don&#39;t you think that is really anti-social, looking at a screen all day?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, but how much more social is it looking at a paper?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Well, I don&#39;t know. I guess it&#39;s not much more social, but I don&#39;t know, at least if you read a newspaper, you can read it outside in the fresh air, for example.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, that&#39;s true. I guess so, but it&#39;s free, and I know how you&#39;re always saving money.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Well, that&#39;s true but, I think the Guardian is a good newspaper so I like to support them. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> I have to admit I do like to go out on Sunday and get a paper and a coffee. Yeah, it&#39;s nice. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yeah, even like just walking to the shop to get the newspaper is quite nice.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, the thing is though, I don&#39;t like how the print media, or newspapers that you buy, have such limited space, and on the internet you can get such a wider range of information that it&#39;s just a lot better I think, cause these days I don&#39;t know if you can really trust what they put in the newspapers.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yeah, I&#39;m not sure that you always can, but I think TV is the same and I think the internet is exactly the same.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s actually why I like radio news, cause I think radio news is a lot more in depth. You can actually hear the person talking, and unlike TV that has very short clips, radio news usually has longer segments, so I am a big fan of that. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yeah, I like the radio, but you can&#39;t see the pictures and I don&#39;t have a very good imagination, so I like to see the pictures.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, I just love the voice. I love when they go, And now to our correspondent in blah-blah-blah. It just sounds cool. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> No, you&#39;re right, it does sound good. And it&#39;s free as well. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, I have the internet in my apartment so anytime you want to read the internet news just come on over.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh, thanks very much. Also, I have a newspaper in my apartment and I get a subscription so, come along and read the newspaper at my flat. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, cool, I&#39;ll definitely take you up on that. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> OK</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Hey, Akane, I was thinking, why don&#39;t we get everyone together tonight and rent a movie.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Sounds like a good idea. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, I&#39;ll run down to the video store. I was thinking, because Star Wars is coming out, why don&#39;t we get the previous Star Wars, Episode II, and watch that. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Oh, man. I really don&#39;t want to watch that again. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> What! Come on it&#39;s Star Wars. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, I watched Episode II before and I really didn&#39;t like it. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Really!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Yeah!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, I thought it was great. I mean I know the critics were really rough, but it had great action, cool characters.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, actually, I thought it was very commercial. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really! </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Yeah, and the whole thing was really mushy, and there were also some annoying characters.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, well, maybe, but, I just like all Star Wars, it doesn&#39;t matter, it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect. As long as there&#39;s storm troopers, and light sabers, I&#39;m happy. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> OK, so you&#39;re a big Star Wars fan. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Huge. But that&#39;s OK. I&#39;ll get that movie another time. Um, how about you suggest a movie. What would you like to see?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Um, I really like romantic comedies, especially Meg Ryan movies</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, no! </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Yeah!<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> I can&#39;t stand her.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> What! What&#39;s wrong with her? </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> She&#39;s terrible. Every movie she has the perfect life, and she has, she looks so cute, but she can&#39;t find love. It&#39;s like, come on, people like that have a perfect job and look cute and beautiful like Meg Ryan do not have trouble finding love. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>But she&#39;s so cute and funny to watch. I just really enjoy watching her. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> I don&#39;t know. I just can&#39;t do it. You know though, I liked Meg Ryan in that movie she&#39;s made about, she went to the Gulf War, or whatever, and she was a helicopter pilot. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Oh, yeah, yeah! I remember that one. I forget what it was called though. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, yeah, she was OK in that but she wasn&#39;t that cutesy romance.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> That&#39;s true. She was a different character than usual. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, so we can&#39;t see a Meg Ryan movie, and we can&#39;t see Star Wars, so what else?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Ah, I don&#39;t know. What about a comedy that will make us really laugh.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, um, let&#39;s see. We could see Shrek.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Oh, I love Shrek. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I haven&#39;t seen Shrek 2. Have you seen Shrek 2? </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Ah, no, I haven&#39;t actually. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Perfect. Shrek 2. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Great! We&#39;ll get that. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>OK.

"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Hello, and welcome to our show.<br />Today, we&rsquo;ll be making one of my favourite recipes.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">It&rsquo;s called the egg spaghetti.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">First, what you will need for this recipe is:</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">About a hundred grams of dried spaghetti,<br />Two table spoons of olive oil,<br />Fifty grams of minced meat,<br />About a half of a medium onion,<br />Half a cup of chopped mushrooms,<br />One cup of tomato sauce, or peeled crushed tomatoes<br />(I prefer peeled crushed tomatoes)<br />And lastly, you will need one egg.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">First, let your water come to a boil, and boil your dried spaghetti.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">While you are waiting for your spaghetti to boil, you can prepare your sauce.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Heat up the pan with the olive oil, and add the minced meat.<br />Brown the minced meat until it gets nice and brown.<br />Lower the heat to about medium heat, and then add your chopped onions.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">It&rsquo;s important to fry your onions in lower heat so that you can let it caramelize. It&rsquo;ll take a while but it will be worth the effort, because all of the sugars will come out of the onion and bring a nice sweat taste to your sauce.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Then, add your mushrooms (your chopped mushrooms), and keep stirring it around until it gets nice and tender. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">And then lastly, you can add your tomato sauce, or peeled crushed tomatoes. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">And let it simmer for a bit until it gets nice and warm.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Your spaghetti should be ready by now. So you can drain the water out and add a bit of olive oil to your spaghetti, so that it won&rsquo;t stick. Put your spaghetti on a plate, and then pour some of your sauce on top.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Now, you can fry your egg on a pan sunny-side-up. I like to leave the yolk nice and soft. And then put the fried egg on top of your spaghetti. Now, when you eat your spaghetti, I like to pierce the egg with a fork so that all the yolk drizzles out and becomes a part of the sauce. The egg is quite alkaline, so it brings a nice mild taste that counteracts with the acidic tomato.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">And enjoy!</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Oh, hello there. Can I help you?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Hi, I&#39;m just looking at some of your paintings here. You have a really nice store here.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yes that&#39;s right, we do don&#39;t we? We have some really nice paintings in here.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>I think I really like this one. Can you tell me a bit about it?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Certainly, yes. Now that one&#39;s actually by a local painter. His name&#39;s John Mansfield and he&#39;s been painting since he was 14 actually, although he died in 1999 so he painted for about 53 years in total. I really like that one myself actually.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>So he died? That means that there aren&#39;t many of his paintings left.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>That&#39;s right, yes. I mean most of his paintings are one-offs and this one is a one-off.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Oh, OK. Well I especially like the colours of this one. I like how it&#39;s bright and it looks really nice and I like how it depicts the local landscape.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yes, that&#39;s true. It is really nice isn&#39;t it? Actually this is a picture of a local walking route which is quite famous and quite popular with hikers. A lot of people go there on walks particularly at the weekend. And if you look on the left hand side there, that tree is the oldest tree in the area.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Oh, is that right?

He was a very devoted painter and he really enjoyed buying paintings by different painters in the area.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Really? Well that sounds really interesting. How much is this painting?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>That one&#39;s actually a hundred and eighty pounds.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Wow! 180 pounds! </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yes I&#39;m afraid so.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Well that&#39;s a bit beyond my budget. Would you be able to give it to me for 100 pounds?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Mm, I think a hundred is too cheap.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Well let&#39;s see. This other painting looks quite nice too. How about if I buy both of them? Would you be able to give it to me for maybe 250 pounds?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>Why don&#39;t we say three hundred and you&#39;ve got yourself a deal. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Three hundred? That sounds good. Thanks a lot. I&#39;ll take it.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>OK then.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Great!</font></p><p></p>"
"<p>I go to church and I&#39;m going to tell you what it looks like inside my church. Firstly, when you go in, there&#39;s normally someone at the door who greets you and they give you a hymn book. Hymns are songs and we have a book full of songs, then in the main part of the church, we sit on pews. Pews are like long wooded seats and the pews in my church are quite big. You can fit about ten, or fifteen people, on one pew. The minister, he&#39;s the man who leads the service, is at the front of the church. He stands behind the pulpit, which is a wooden box, and he puts the bible on that box.</p><p></p>There are lots of stained glass windows in my church. They are windows with colored glass in them, and they often have pictures in them, normally pictures of stories in the bible. We also have an organ in church, and somebody plays the organ every week. The organ pipes are at the front and it&#39;s very loud. However, we also have a piano, and a small group of people who do singing on other days. I really like my church. I like the atmosphere there and I really think it&#39;s a friendly place.<p></p>"

"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> So Akane, is there anything that you&rsquo;re frightened of?<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m really scared of horror movies. I never watch them, cuz they really really frighten me.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Horror movies wow. Have your ever seen a horror movie?<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, um, when I was little I used to watch them with my friends, because, back in the 80&rsquo;s, horror movies used to be really popular. Like ah &ldquo;Jason&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Freddy Cruger&rdquo;. (Oh yeah) and things like that yeah. But ah, they used to keep me up at night and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yeah, my friend actually had a &ldquo;Freddy Cruger&rdquo; poster. It used to frighten me.<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Did she?<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t my favorite. So, ah, what don&rsquo;t you like about horror movies?<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, um, I think, I think uh, I don&rsquo;t know, I think it&rsquo;s the psychological aspect of it. They just really make me feel scared.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Ah, heh.. What was the last horror movie that you watched?<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Um, the last one I watched was, I think it was the &ldquo;Blair Witch Project&rdquo;.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh I know that film, yeah<br />.<br /><strong>Akane:</strong> The first one, I saw it in the theatre with my friend. And I couldn&rsquo;t sleep properly for a week after that.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh no!<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Ya, I mean, I know it&rsquo;s stupid. A lot of people think it&rsquo;s a pretty stupid movie. Um, but I think it was just, just the psychological aspect of it that really made me feel scared. And uh, I think, with that movie, after people saw it, they weren&rsquo;t really sure whether it was real or not.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh yeah.<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> And so there was that element as, as well.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Was that the same film that I&rsquo;m thinking of. The one where they filmed people in a forest, is that right?<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. It was in a forest. And the whole thing was done with a camcorder. A hand held camcorder. And so, it was, a lot of it was, I think, black and white. I can&rsquo;t remember. And uh, and the camera was very shaky, and&hellip;<br /><br /><strong>Ruth: </strong>So it wasn&rsquo;t professionally filmed?<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Um, I guess it didn&rsquo;t look like it was.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Right.<br /><br /><strong>Akane:</strong> Yeah, I heard that the movie actually only took um, It didn&rsquo;t take a lot of money to film it.<br />But it, it made a lot of money.<br /><br /><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yeah, I can believe that actually, I can believe that.

They don't learn how to share or, you know, how to get along with and talk to different people.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, I think that the child will actually get more interaction if there's a stay at home parent because the parent will be able to take them to different activities and to other houses to have playmates and at the same time, they'll be able to spend more time with that parent and have socializing time with family members.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> But I think children could get those same experiences from different people who look after them. It wouldn't necessarily have to be there family who looked after them surely.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, sure but, I think that it's different when a person who is not related takes care of a child. I'm sure that they do their best but the love is not there. The caretaker would not love the child as much as the parent would and at the same time if there's one person taking care of ten different children at the same time I would wonder about the amount of attention that the child would get,and safety issues as well.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> But I think you've got to look at the practical aspect of this. It's not always practical for people who don't have much money to have one parent staying at home all of the time.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> That's true. I really agree about that.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh, good we agree on one thing.</font></p><p></p><p></p>                                        "

When they speak their own language instead?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Firstly, I give them a stern look, although that doesn't always work, then, well, if I'm setting an activity, I always make sure that, I ask them first of all which language they are going to do the activity in, and any student who's not going to speak English has to put their hand up and generally students don't like to be the odd one out so they don't put their hand up.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> That's a pretty good strategy.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> What do you do? </font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Um, well, I don't know, I mean, I haven't had much success really, so I've actually been pretty casual about it.

"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Hey, Akane<strong>, </strong>I know that you cook a lot, and I never cook, but it&#39;s starting to get really expensive to eat out so I wanna cook more. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Right.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Can you recommend something that is very, very easy for somebody who does not know how to cook.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> OK, well, I&#39;m not the best cook myself but I do cook often for financial reasons because it is cheaper. Um, I would recommend, if you&#39;re not used to cooking I would recommend the fried noodles. It&#39;s quick. It&#39;s easy. It&#39;s inexpensive, and yeah, I think you can do it.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Mm, OK, so what do I do? I mean actually, first of all, what do I need to buy?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Well, I think you would need to go to the grocery store and get some noodles. You can get the ready prepared ones which are quick and easy. The dried ones you would have to boil first, so I would prepare, I would recommend the ready prepared ones and you also need some vegetables, and maybe if you like you can also add some meats.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Mm, OK, I probably won&#39;t do the meat thing, but for the vegetables, what vegetables do you recommend?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, I recommend seasonal vegetables because the ones in season are always higher in vitamins and nutrients. Right now it&#39;s about early summer, late spring so the ones that are good right now egg plants, spinach and, well bean sprouts are good all year round.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Mm, OK, so assuming I buy all this stuff (right) bring it home, what do I do?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, first you need a good frying pan. (I got that) OK, first you actually need to wash the vegetables and cut them up into small pieces and then heat the pan up with oil and then put the vegetables in first because they take longer to cook than the noodles. After you have seen that the vegetables have gotten slightly brown and soft, then you can add the noodles and mix it up until the noodles are heated up and then just season it with salt and pepper or a sauce that you like.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, sounds pretty easy, but as for the oil, what kind of oil should I get?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane: </strong>Well, vegetable oil, kanola oil, or olive oil, I think would be the healthiest choices.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, now one problem I have about cooking is, for people who don&#39;t know how to cook, how much do you cook? Like you said, chop up the vegetables (Yeah) Do I chop up five eggplants, one eggplant?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, if it&#39;s just for yourself, I would recommend just one eggplant and maybe half a bag of bean sprouts and half a bunch of spinach. The vegetables really shrink after you cook them so it might look like a lot when they&#39;re raw, but once you cook them. They shrink.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. Well, I&#39;ll give it a try, and I&#39;ll tell you how it tastes.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Great. Good luck.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"

What happened?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well, it's kind of a funny story actually. I fell asleep on the bus and I was so tired that afternoon. It was a Friday afternoon and I'd had a long week and just fell deep into sleep and I really didn't notice when we were at the end of the bus ride and we were at the station, and then I was really upset because the bus driver didn't say anything and so I just kept sleeping and by the time I woke up and noticed we were on our way back to the school again.<strong> </strong>Yes, and I didn't get a chance to press the button and get off until I was almost halfway to the school, so I ended up getting home really late and even more tired and it wasn't a very good experience at all.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Did you say anything to the bus driver when you got off?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> No, I didn't because I was so flustered and I was in a rush to get off that I didn't really get to say anything.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, that must have been so annoying.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> It was.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So what time did you actually make it home?</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> I think it was around 7:30, maybe.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, the next time we come home, I'll look for you and I'll make sure to wake you up.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane</strong>: For sure, and make sure to look in the back seat and make sure I'm not lying down horizontally because I think that's maybe how the bus driver missed out on the fact I was there. </font></p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>               "

"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Yeah, I want to talk about one of my pet peeves. You know a pet peeve is something that you as a person don&#39;t like. You personally don&#39;t like a habit or a mannerism or something that other people do, um, for example a pet peeve could be people who don&#39;t like wrinkled shirts or they don&#39;t like it when people chew gum in public, or like the noise that some people make, or habits, mannerisms, for example my grandmother, my grandmother&#39;s pet peeve was, you know, messy clothes or people who wore messy clothes. She didn&#39;t like that, you know, if someone had a whole in their sock, she would sew it up immediately. She just hated it. It was her pet peeve, you know, if you didn&#39;t wear nice, crisp, clean clothes, you know, you know some people&#39;s pet peeve is, you know, when other people talk on the cell phone, ah, things like that. Yeah, my pet peeve is a little more complicated. It&#39;s a little more unique I think then other people&#39;s pet peeves, but it&#39;s when Canadians wear, or embroider, canadian flags on their backpack. </font></p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">That&#39;s just something that&#39;s annoying or irritating for me. It&#39;s my pet peeve. I&#39;m Canadian so it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t like Canada or I don&#39;t like Canadians because I am Canadian and I do love my country, but it&#39;s just so cheesy when I see so many travelers, usually the backpacking kind that put Canadian paraphernalia, especially Canadian embroidered flags on their suitcases or backpack. I don&#39;t know why it bothers me. I guess I think it&#39;s not cool, or I can&#39;t see the reason why to do that. I mean, people tell me it&#39;s to show that they&#39;re not American, but, who cares? You should be able to just tell them, Hey, I&#39;m from, you know, I&#39;m from Canada, I&#39;m from Vancouver, I&#39;m from Toronto, I&#39;m from Saskatchewan, where ever.

So you know, the day would start off with me sleeping in till about 9 or 10 o&#39;clock. You know, get up, make myself a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, or something like that, maybe grapefruit juice. Pick up the daily paper and read it for awhile. After that&#39;s done, you know, I&#39;d probably get ready and just drop in to a friend&#39;s place, you know, drop by, unannounced. No planned meeting or anything like that. You know, hang out at my friend&#39;s place, you know, chat, talk about, you know, probably talk about where to have lunch, you know, since I love eating, I&#39;d have to go out for lunch, you know, probably somewhere where there is a patio or a nice place to eat outside or do some serious people watching. </font></p>"

Uh, we are traveling in Japan, so the train is very fast and efficient, however, it is expensive, and another thing is, you&#39;re confined by schedule and things like that. How about the disadvantages of a car?</p><p><strong>Friend: </strong>Ah, pollution, accidents, cost, yeah, cars can be expensive, too, maintenance, gas.</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>And how about the plane?</p><p><strong>Friend: </strong>The disadvantages of a plane. The lack of view,and yeah, that stale, stale air.</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, yeah, also, I could sort of say the fear factor, yeah, and being confined to a small space. Yeah that&#39;s it.</p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Yeah, hi, I wanna talk about, yeah, watching sports, like live or on TV. I mean I like to play sports more than I like to watch sports but sometimes a good game on TV or watching it live can be really good, um, you know, everybody, or many people like to watch the olympics or the world cup of soccer, I mean those kinds of sports are really, really exciting. I like to watch them too. I like to watch a good game on TV, you know, it there&#39;s lots of buildup and tension for the match, it&#39;s even better. One sport that I&#39;ve been really getting into recently is Japanese Sumo wrestling, yeah, it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s quite a spectacle. Many westerners think that it&#39;s kind of a joke, you know, a bunch of fat guys in tiny underwear, you know bashing their bodies against each other, but there&#39;s really a lot more to it than that, I mean, these guys are incredibly athletic.</font></p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">They also are quite strong and they have a repertoire of martial arts and wrestling ability. It&#39;s pretty amazing to watch. I mean the matches are really really short so sometimes the uninitiated don&#39;t know what going on but basically the rules are stay on your feet and stay in the small circle and, you know, try to get your opponent to fall down or to go out of the circle. That&#39;s why they only take about 10 or 20 seconds to finish a match because they do everything they can, but finally, before you know it, the match is over, you know, they do wrestling throws, they do martial arts, they do all kinds of things. It&#39;s really fun, and there&#39;s the whole ritual with it as well, I mean it&#39;s pretty amazing.</font><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Simon: </strong>Hi, Lesie.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Hey, Simon. Have you heard that they&#39;re making the third episode of the new Star Wars series?</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Do you like Star Wars?</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, the old Star Wars that they made 20 years ago, I really like.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Me, too. Me, too.What&#39;s your favorite episode of the old series?</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Of course, that would have to be number two, The Empire Strikes Back.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Really, mine is the original Star Wars.</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, really! Why do you like it so much? Why is it the best?</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong> I think it&#39;s the best because the characters are really, really different. In the second and third one they&#39;re kind of, they begin to mellow, but in the first one, they&#39;re really different.</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Oh, you mean that each character is distinct from the other characters.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Right!</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, I like the second one better because it&#39;s a little bit darker and cooler and the bad guy, Darth Vader, of course one of the most famous bad guys in movie history, plays a bigger part and you know there&#39;s the drama and plus the, you know, the fighting, and the space scenes are all a little bit better and cooler.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>I see. Well, my favorite character is Princess Leia. Do you know why?</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll tell me.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Well, because she was the first positive strong female character I saw in the movies. She was take charge, told everybody what to do.</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Well, she was popular with both girls and boys.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Right! Hey, did you have any Star Wars toys when you were a kid?</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>Yeah, of course, I had the Luke Skywalker action figure.</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Oh, I see.</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>How about you?</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>Ah, I can&#39;t remember. I don&#39;t remember if I have any, if I had any toys but I had the soundtrack to the movie.</p><p><strong>Simon: </strong>So can you sing, can you hymn it a little bit of the soundtrack right now?</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>No, but I can tell you most of the dialogue from the first movie.</p><p><strong>Simon:</strong>So that you can say that you are a diehard Star Wars fan?</p><p><strong>Lesie: </strong>I am a diehard Star Wars fan.</p><p><strong>Simon:</strong>Yeah, when I was young, me too.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Ruth: </strong>So, Akane, you&#39;re from Canada, right?</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Tell me about where you live.</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>Well, I grew up in Toronto, and it&#39;s quite a big city. In the greater Toronto area, there&#39;s about, I think3 1/2 million people just now and it&#39;s very multicultural and that&#39;s one of the things that I really like about Toronto is that there&#39;re many different people from many different countries.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>And do you live in Toronto now?</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>No, actually, I haven&#39;t lived there for a year now I think, almost, actually more than that, because I&#39;ve been travelling and working and what not.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Oh, right. What&#39;s your job?</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>I&#39;m actually a teacher.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Do you teach children or adults?</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>Usually I do. I am mostly trained to teach younger children, but recently I&#39;ve begun teaching older students, or young adults, and I quite enjoy it actually.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>So which do you prefer?</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>Well, they both have good parts and bad parts and I think in the future I would like to do a bit of both.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Do you know where you would like to live in the future?</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>I have no idea. I would like to travel to different places and maybe I&#39;ll eventually settle back down in Toronto, where I&#39;m from.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Do you have family in Toronto?</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>Not at the moment, no. My parents moved to Vancouver and that&#39;s where they live right now.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Ah, Vancouver, is that in Canada was well?</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>That&#39;s right. It&#39;s on the West Coast of Canada and the weather is much warmer there and that&#39;s why my parents like it there.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Oh, wow, it sounds nice.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> So Akane, what do you think about children today having mobile phones?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Mobile phones? Well, I mean, I think they could be a good thing, I mean for safety reasons.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Really?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Yes if I was a parent I think I would feel safer knowing that my child had a mobile phone and I could get in touch with them whenever I need to and if something happens like an emergency then they will be able to use the mobile phone.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> You see I would argue that they&rsquo;re quite dangerous actually, because children don&rsquo;t really have the best attention spans anyway and often they could, for example, walk into the road whilst they were talking on their mobile phone and generally not pay attention so I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re very safe.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well that&rsquo;s a good point but that could also teach them responsibility as well. If mobile phones are unsafe, I mean bicycles could be unsafe and toys could be unsafe, but that&rsquo;s all part of growing up and I think that if you teach them responsibility, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a big problem.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> But I think fewer children these days play on bikes than they used to; I think children are more dependent upon technology and I see that as, as a definite negative thing because children don&rsquo;t play out as they used to before. They just stay in and watch TV and play on computer games.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> True, true. I suppose so, but you know technology is a necessity in our lives and in the future if we want them to become competent in using technology and taking advantage of technology then I think it would be a good way to start.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Don&rsquo;t you think they are really expensive though? I mean, don&rsquo;t&hellip;</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Oh yeah, they are.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth: </strong>If I was a parent though I would not want my child to be phoning people left, right and centre because it would cost so much money.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Akane:</strong> Well you could be right about that. They do cost a lot of money. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oh, I&rsquo;m glad you agree.

"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">My favorite season has to be autumn, although when it gets to autumn I feel slightly disapointed because I know that after summer the weather gets colder and the nights get shorter and the evenings get darker. I still really like autumn. One of my favorite things about autumn is whan all of the leaves fall off the trees and you can walk about and crunch in the leaves. However I think my favorite thing about autumn is the conkers. I love it when conkers fall off trees and you can collect them. </font></p><p></p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">When I was at school we used to collect conkers and put them on stings and then we would have a competition to see who had the best conker. We would hit our conkers with somebody elses and if yours didn&#39;t smash then you could have one point so after your first game, your conker would be a oner. Then if you won twice, it would be a twoer and so on. It was a really good game and it kept us amused for hours. Conkers are great fun. Have you ever played conkers? Maybe you should. Why don&#39;t you try it this autumn?</font><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Akane: </strong>Hi, Ruth!</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Oh, hi.</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>So, what did you do today?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>That&#39;s a good question. Actually, today, I went to the onsen.</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>Oh, the onsen. What&#39;s an onsen?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>An onsen is a public bath and people go there, basically just to sit in hot water, and it&#39;s, it&#39;s a bit like a spa and it&#39;s really relaxing. You just sit there and don&#39;t do anything really because it&#39;s so warm. It&#39;s really nice.</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>Oh, OK. Well, what did you think about it?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>I really enjoyed myself. I&#39;d never been to an onsen before, so today was my first experience and I am quite British and you have to go in with no clothes on so I was a little bit concerned about that, but it went OK.</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>Oh, OK. Well, are you going to tell your friends and family that you did that?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Um, I think probably I will tell them, and I think they might listen to this actually, so</p><p><strong>Akane: </strong>And how do you think they&#39;ll feel about that?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>They&#39;ll probably think it&#39;s really funny. Yeah, I think they&#39;ll laugh.</p><p><strong>Akane:</strong>OK, well, actually, I&#39;ve been to an onsen too before.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Oh, really!</p><p><strong>Akane:</strong>Yes I have. I actually, do really enjoy it. I think it&#39;s very relaxing. If you go to the big onsens, they have lots of different kinds of baths and one of them is called the Electric Bath and when you go into it you feel little tiny electric shocks and it&#39;s supposed to be good to increase your blood circulation, apparently.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Does it hurt?</p><p><strong>Akane:</strong>When I went into that one I was very little, so I thought it hurt and I didn&#39;t really like it</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">There are two things which really annoy me. Actually I experience both of them, sometimes, on public transport. Often when I travel I go on buses and on trains and both of these things seem to occur quite often. Firstly is when other people listen to music, they listen to their CD player or their MP3 player and the music is really loud. I mean, I don&#39;t mind if other people want to listen to music. In fact, I also really like listening to music and I often take my MP3 player to different places with me but I don&#39;t like listening to other people&#39;s music so I wish they would just turn the volume down a bit.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">The other thing which really peeves me is when people leave their mobile phones on in public and the phones ring and ring and people never know whose phone it is because often people have the same ringtone. But the worst thing is when people have long conversations in public on their mobile phones. I don&#39;t really want to hear everybody else&#39;s gossip. I mean, obviously sometimes it is necessary to make a phone call to arrange a lift or to organise something. That&#39;s different. But when people have lengthy conversations I really get annoyed. I wonder what you think about that?</font></p><p></p>"
"<p>When I was younger I was in an organisation called the guides. Guides are girls who are between 10 and 14 who get together once a week to do things like have competions and play games and go camping and generally just have fun together. I really enjoyed being in the guides. There&#39;s a similar organisation called the scouts for boys although I think these days girls can be scouts and maybe boys can be guides - I&#39;m not sure. Anyway I used to go camping quite a lot with guides. I remember I went one weekend and it was the same weekend as my birthday and I was going to be 13 that weekend. We had a really good weekend and we cooked different things and we played games and we didn&#39;t really get much sleep as you generally don&#39;t when you&#39;re sleeping in a tent with a lot of people your age you tend to stay up all night.</p>So on my birthday which was the Sunday, everybody sang Happy Birthday to me and they gave me a cake and they wrote on a card for me and I had a really nice day. That evening I went home and I was so tired and I started to unpack my things. And then the doorbell rang and my friend arrived and then one by one - it was very strange- all of my friends arrived, and what had happened was my parents had organised a surprise birthday party for me! I was so excited but I was also very smelly. I hadn&#39;t had a shower for the whole weekend. We had a great time, we went bowling and it was really a day to remember.<p></p>"

Yeah, so. I have to admit that when I'm on a plane I get kind of freaked out, when I fly, yeah. You think, ""How is this thing staying in the air?"". You know?</p> <p><strong>Ruth: </strong>You're always happy to land. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, yeah. Always, always, very happy to land, and often when I go home I have to fly across the Pacific and there's no land so you look out your window and you think, ""Ah, if something goes wrong with the plane we can't land anymore, but that's very irrational because most accidents I think happen over mountains, so. I think so.</p> <p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Although if you landed in the sea, then there might be sharks. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That's true. How do you feel when you fly? </p> <p><strong>Ruth: </strong>I quite like flying actually. I quite like it. I mean I'm quite used to flying. I've flown to a lot of places.

I didn't eat it. I just had it in front of me. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, I heard that the vegetarian meal are actually better than the chicken or beef meal. </p> <p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Really, they're quite good, I mean when I've had then in the past they've been quite good. </p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, here's to not seeing any sharks in the future. </p> <p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Absolutely.</p> <p><br /></p>               "
"<p>My most embarrassing moment was probably when I lived in Germany. One day I decided to go shopping and I drove into town. I had a car. And I was very, very pleased because I found a parking space immedately which was rather unusual. I did my shopping, which only took half an hour and I went back to my car, and to my absolute horror it was no longer on the ground but it was suspended in the air. I really did not know what to do at this point so I walked back into town and I went to the police station. The police were very kind to me and I was very grateful for that and they interviewed me.</p>They asked me what had happened and I said &#39;I&#39;m really sorry, I didn&#39;t buy a parking ticket&#39; and they said &#39;We hadn&#39;t even noticed that!&#39;, they said &#39;Do you realise where you had parked?&#39; and I said &#39;Well no, I have no idea&#39; and they said &#39;Well actually you parked into the entrance to a car park and as a result nobody could get out of the car park because you were parked in the entrance&#39;. So I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time then. It was very embarrassing: I hadn&#39;t seen the sign, I hadn&#39;t noticed the car park which was rather silly. Erm, but now my friends think it is really funny when I tell them the story. I also think it&#39;s funny but it was an expensive mistake!<p></p>"

There&#39;s a shop and a post office, a school and my mom teaches at the school.</p><p>I did actually live in Edinburgh for one year and that was quite different from life in my village because there was so much more to do and there were so many more people and there was so much more traffic, but I think actually I prefer living in a village because, well, if you want to go out to the shops, if you want to go to the cinema, you can go to the nearest town, or to the nearest city, but you can always escape city life and you can always go back to where it&#39;s quiet and more peaceful and where everybody knows each other, but if you live in the city you can&#39;t really escape it, and I don&#39;t really like the noise of the city so I think I will probably live in a village for the rest of my life.</p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">I&#39;m an English teacher in Japan and when I first came here I didn&#39;t really have very much money so I found things quite expensive and I went out looking for cheap bargains. I came across a shop and it called the 100 Yen shop. It&#39;s absolutely fantastic. 100 Yen is about 50 p, 50 pence that is. I think that&#39;s about 1 dollar, and you go in there and everything is 100 yen. You can buy all sorts of things in a 100 yen shop. You can buy food. You can buy things for your house, things for your bathroom, your kitchen. You can buy ornaments and stationary and things like shampoo. I really, really like to get a bargain and when I go in and I know that I&#39;ve found something and it&#39;s worth buying, I really, really get excited about it, and it sends shivers down my spine. We have a shop in Britain and it&#39;s quite similar to the 100 yen shop. It&#39;s called Pound Land and so everything in it is 1 pound. Not everything is a real bargain.</font></p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Some things are really pretty rubbish but if you do find a bargain, it&#39;s great. It reminds me really of what we have in Britain called car boot sales. They are places where people go and they fill their cars full of things that they don&#39;t want anymore and they sell them and people look through other people&#39;s items and they find the things that they want to buy and they barter, so they try and get things for a cheap price. It&#39;s really good though when you get a bargain. How do you feel about that?</font><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Well, I&#39;m going to talk a little bit about why I&#39;m vegetarian. Actually, I became vegetarian when I was 8 years old. We did a project at school and I found out that animals are actually killed for us to eat and as an 8 year-old I thought that was rather immoral, so I went home and I told my parents that I didn&#39;t want to eat meat anymore so now I eat everything really except for meat and fish and I don&#39;t eat things with animals fats in either. I think really I&#39;m a vegetarian now because it&#39;s a habit and if I were to eat meat, I think I would be quite ill. My favorite food is probably tofu although I like broccoli and I like chocolate as well. </font></p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Sometimes because I like traveling, I go to places and it&#39;s really difficult for vegetarians because they don&#39;t really have anything for vegetarians to eat, so sometimes I just have like, a bowl of rice, or an omelet, or something like that, but when I&#39;m at home, I like to cook for myself, and I like to cook nice vegetarian dishes, and stews and things like that. My parents didn&#39;t mind me becoming a vegetarian, and I think they were really good about it because I don&#39;t know many people, who when their child said they wanted to be a vegetarian would except that, so I was really grateful to my parents for being so nice and understanding about it.</font><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, Ruth, now, you are a vegetarian.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So what is a good vegetarian dish that you cook?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Well, actually, I&#39;m not a very good cook, so that would be difficult to say. I quite like to make, like a vegetable stew with tofu in it. Things like that, but it&#39;s not very exciting.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, how do you make the stew?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Well, firstly, you get all of the vegetable ready and so you chop them up and the potatoes and you boil the potatoes and then you boil the other vegetables, and you fry the tofu with onions and then I think you just put it all together in a pan and stick it in the oven, I think.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Sounds pretty good.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>It&#39;s very easy.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>What vegetables do you usually put inside the stew?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Oh, thinks like carrots and leaks and courgettes sometimes, mushrooms, and really any vegetables that are in season that I can get hold of.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Courgettes? Is that squash? Zucchini?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>I think it might be squash. No, I think it&#39;s zucchini.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Zucchini.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>I think it&#39;s zucchini.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, yeah, I think in the states we call it zucchini.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>And you would call aubergine, eggplant.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yes. What do you call eggplant?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Aubergine.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Aubergine.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>How do you spell it?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Good question. A-U-B-E-R-G-I-N-E.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow. How do you spell courgettes?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>C-O-U-R-G-E-T-T-E</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>That&#39;s pretty good. Now can you spell Zucchini?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Probably not. Z-U-C-C-H-I-N-I.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, maybe that&#39;s it. One more time.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Z-U-C-C-H-I-N-I.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, I think that&#39;s it. Zucchini. I&#39;m not even sure.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>I&#39;m not either.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, what&#39;s your favorite vegetable?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Ah, it has to be broccoli.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, yeah?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>I really like broccoli. They look like little trees, there that&#39;s nice.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, that&#39;s true. Yeah, if you just get one broccoli and start eating it, you can&#39;t even finish it. It&#39;s just so big.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Oh, you can. You definitely can.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, how do you cook your broccoli?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Just very briefly really because there&#39;s nothing worse than soggy broccoli. You cook it. You boil it in a pan with water only for a three or four minutes. What&#39;s your favorite vegetable?</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>That&#39;s a good question. I would have to go with the eggplant and the aubergine?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Aubergine.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Aubergine. So the aubergine as you call it, yeah.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>I think eggplant&#39;s the best. Really, don&#39;t you think they&#39;re sometimes a bit soggy?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Actually I kind of like them that way.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Really.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah. I like them any way. Although the bad thing about the eggplant is you can&#39;t eat it raw.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yeah, that&#39;s true. It takes effort.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, Ruth in Europe, have you traveled much?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Yeah, actually, um, well, when I was younger I went on a tour around all of Western Europe and then when I was at university I backpacked around Scandinavia for a month with a friend. <strong>(Nice!)</strong> It was really nice, actually, yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow, so where did you go in Scandinavia?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Well, we started off in Sweden and then we went to Norway and then we went to Denmark. We never actually made it to Finland. That was simply because we ran out of money, so.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So were you out in the wilderness, or were you just going from village to village?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Really we just, we arrived in Stockholm. We went around Stockholm. We went to Oslo. We spent most of our time in the cities, although everything was so expensive. We ended up sleeping in youth hostels or on people&#39;s floors.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>What do you remember most about your trip?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Um, probably just having no money, so we couldn&#39;t eat really for a fortnight.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>You couldn&#39;t eat?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Well, we ate breakfast in the youth hostel, and then we would take a bread roll from the youth hostel, from the breakfast bar and have that for lunch and then in the evening we would eat if we could afford it.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Actually, in terms of food, what do people in Scandinavia usually eat?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Um, I think they eat a lot of potatoes and meat and things. I&#39;m not sure really what a typical Scandinavian meal would be.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>That&#39;s OK. You didn&#39;t have any money to buy any food right?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>We didn&#39;t eat so.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, silly question. Um, so what do you remember most about Stockholm?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Ah, they&#39;ve got some really nice buildings in Stockholm. I&#39;ve got relatives who live in Stockholm so we stayed with them, and also it was really hot when we went there, but it was also very pricey.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So in every store you went into were they playing ABBA?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>No. Thank goodness.</p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Now Jeanie, you listen to Hip-hop music.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Jeanie:</strong> Yeah.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. Actually me too. I like Hip-hop when I run. Do you think that Hip-hop music negatively influences people? Do you think it should be censored or should be controlled in anyway?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Jeanie:</strong> I feel like it has a tendency to negatively influence people, mostly because the people it influences aren&#39;t very strong or very confident in themselves. They feel like that in order to be something they have to<br />do what the people who made money are doing. For them it looks like the easy way out. For example if you&#39;re stuck in poverty and you look at the TV and you look at people who are exactly like you, who are stuck in poverty and suddenly all they did was, they did gang banging and stuff like that, and then they rapped about it, and they got money, it&#39;s like Wow, why don&#39;t I do that. And I have to build up this hard image so that I can make money. You know, get to the top.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>So you&#39;re saying part of the problem is for people to aspire to be a popular Hip-hop artist, they actually have to do some type of criminal activity first?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Jeanie:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s the image that you get because in all the music they&#39;re rapping about what they did. You know, and if you ask somebody later on, oh did you really do that? and they say, Oh, no. It was just for a song then you know, people are all Oh, you&#39;re not cool. You know, you want to rap about something that you&#39;ve actually been through. It&#39;s a really, you know, Yeah I did this. I&#39;m really hard. You know. Otherwise you&#39;re just, you&#39;re just speaking. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, do you think that the music should be censored in anyway?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Jeanie:</strong> I think to a point it should be, just as far as kids, children don&#39;t need to hear this stuff all the time and you know, unfortunately what you get, even if they censor it in the stores and say Oh, it&#39;s, this is not for kids, or you know, stuff like that, you&#39;re going to get in these areas, people driving down the street in their big expensive cars blasting this kind of music, so the kids are going to hear it anyway, so I don&#39;t feel that there is a real way to censor it</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, I guess this problem is always going to be around.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Jeanie:</strong> Yeah.</font></p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Hey, Eucharia can you give us a brief history of Ireland?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Sure well, I think most people know of St Patrick&rsquo;s day and that it is an Irish festival which celebrates being Irish. Well, St Patrick was brought to Ireland in 460 as a slave from Wales and then he left and went to Italy where he was converted to Christianity and then he went back to Ireland to bring Christianity to the Irish Celtic people. So, skipping ahead a few years. The Celtic people were always quite unique within Europe because we&hellip; the Celtic people always believed in equality between men and women and therefore there were women warriors in Ireland which used to frighten many of the potential invaders away because a lot of men didn&rsquo;t like to be beaten by women back then and maybe it&rsquo;s still true today. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Then the next biggest thing in history was the colonialisation of Ireland by England, starting in the 16th century until the early 20th century. And it wasn&rsquo;t taken to readily because of the nature of the Celtic warriors. It was probably the bloodiest period in history because the Celtic people did not like to be colonised, so there was a lot of fighting and battles between the English and the Irish even though the English had, to all intents and purposes, colonised, it was not an easy colonisation. But the single most effective tech that the Eng used in the colonisation came in 1822 when the English implemented a national education system. Before this the Irish people used to go and learn in schools called &lsquo;hedge schools&rsquo; ,so they were outside and they were given by people who wanted to teach, so genuine academics and people learned stuff like ancient greek, latin, so most people have this tradition of speaking other languages, mathematics&hellip; So when the education system was changed in line with the English colonial system it became illegal to speak Irish in the classroom and it became illegal to speak Irish in many places. Now in my city there&rsquo;s a lovely trading area called &lsquo;The Old English Market&rsquo; and its called &lsquo;The Old English Market&rsquo; because there is a sign inside the door: &lsquo;Anyone who will speak&hellip; who will speak in Irish and not in English will be sent to jail&rsquo;. So it was really strictly enforced and it was a very&hellip; I can&rsquo;t say laudible technique but&hellip; it was a very effective way of colonisation. Nowadays in Ireland people spk English and people speak Irish, both, and it&rsquo;s considered bilingual. All documents, all street names are written in Irish and English.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">1922 there was what was known as the civil war and that was the beginning of the end for the English so the firstt Irish constitution was written in 1935 and it stated that Ireland is a neutral country so therefore Ireland did not enter World War 2 and it was declared a Republic in 1949.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Thanks. That was a good history!</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Eucharia, you are into drama?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Yes, I have a Masters in drama and theatre and at the moment I am hoping to get onto a PHD programme in drama and theatre.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So what&rsquo;s the thing about drama? What excites you about drama?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Well I find it&rsquo;s a very communicative way to study things and study about people and<br />you learn how to read people in drama, so usually I can understand what people are saying even though they might be lying, which comes in handy sometimes.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>That would be useful!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Yeah, so erm, I think it&rsquo;s very useful for me as well. I am an English lecturer so I use a lot of drama in my classes such as role plays. And I ask my students to create little plays, little mini dramas so they really respond well because it&rsquo;s a semi-controlled version of English learning in so far as they can rehearse but it has to sound reasonably natural. So, at the moment I&rsquo;m hoping to get on to a PHD course which will investigate about drama in the English&hellip; in English as a foreign language classroom, so especially I would like to concentrate on a lot of&hellip;I would like to concentrate a lot on Asian drama and try to bring Asian theatre to the world&rsquo;s attention. I don&rsquo;t know how successful I will be but here&rsquo;s hoping!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I&rsquo;m sure you will be successful! Now, Eucharia, you are into drama. Can you tell&hellip;what do you do for stage fright?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Ah, stage fright! Well, usually I get stage fright still, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; many actors get stage fright, many famous actors get stage fright. I get stage fright every time I&rsquo;m going to teach a new class. The night before I&rsquo;m usually throwing up my dinner in the toilet, I can&rsquo;t sleep&hellip;</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> What, for teaching?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> &hellip;I&rsquo;m sweating, yes!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> No?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Yes! I get really bad stage fright but the minute I step into the classroom or the minute I get onto the stage it just all falls into place. I just feel like &lsquo;Yeah this is what I&rsquo;m made to do&rsquo; but the night before it is always the worst case scenario so I am always thinking of what can go wrong. So that&rsquo;s my particular brand of stage fright but once I get on stage or once I get in front of the class I will be fine. I know this.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow, that&rsquo;s cool</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Eucharia, why don&rsquo;t we talk about what is our favourite Shakespeare play and actually what is the story about?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> OK, I love the story of Romeo and Juliet (I know, I&rsquo;m a girl!) which is a tragedy. It&rsquo;s about a boy and a girl who fall in love but unfortunately their families are sworn enemies of each other and it ends up with both of them killing themselves, so it&rsquo;s quite a sad play.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So that&rsquo;s a tragedy, right?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> That&rsquo;s a tragedy. I also like Hamlet. Hamlet the play opens and we see Hamlet talking to the ghost of his father and the ghost explains to Hamlet that he was killed by his brother who has now become Hamlet&rsquo;s stepfather because he married Hamlet&rsquo;s mother.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">So hamlet has to avenge his father by killing his stepfather slash uncle. And Hamlet procrastinates throughout the play: he keeps on putting it off and putting it off and putting it off, and at the end, because he has put it off the situation just gets worse and worse and the reason I like Hamlet is I&rsquo;m exactly the same. I procrastinate if I don&rsquo;t want to do something, for example if I don&rsquo;t want to correct homework my appartment gets cleaned, my car gets cleaned, I clean out the computer&hellip; I&rsquo;m like Hamlet but eventually I do correct the homework!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> You&rsquo;re not going to go and kill your uncle?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> No</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, just checking!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> No, no, nothing like that. I could kill some of the journals that I get sometimes (the homework). </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">But I also love Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedies. They have this timeless quality: they&rsquo;re funny now and they&rsquo;re funny to many different cultures even though humour is a culturally related issue, but I think Shakespearian comedy might.. er ..are accessible to all. I like The Taming of the Shrew and I don&rsquo;t know if you remember an American soap opera called &lsquo;Moonlighting&rsquo; with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd and they did a version of The Taming of the Shrew and I saw it when I was a child and I thought &lsquo;wow that&rsquo;s a really funny story for that particular soap opera&rsquo; .</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">And then when I went to junior high school and senior high school I realised &lsquo;oh it&rsquo;s a Shakespeare play&rsquo; so I really like that, I really like A Midsummer Nights Dream and I&rsquo;m not sure if can tell the story any more<br />Erm and I remember in school I had to study the sonnets and I really liked them which surprised me because I&rsquo;m not a big poetry person but I really found Shakespeare accessible.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh thanks</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Eucharia, you are into drama so I thought we would talk about Shakespeare.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Cool!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> First of all, who is Shakespeare?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Well, Shakespeare is one of the most famous playwrights of the world. He was born in 1564 in Stratford on Avon in England which is a really pretty town and he opened the Globe theatre in London I think at some stage but the main thing why Shakespeare is so famous&hellip; he had a really short life. Back in those days to make it to 40 was considered old age but in his relatively short life he produced an enormous body of work. He produced historical plays, tragedies, comedies, poetry, sonnets&hellip; So he was an extremely prolific writer and I think the reason that he&rsquo;s so famous even today is because the themes he chose for most of his work were universal. They&rsquo;re themes that touch us whether we speak English, whether we speak Spanish or Russian, whether we&rsquo;re in the 21st century or in the 16th century. They&rsquo;re themes that are eternal and they concern humanity, and have concerned humanity for such a long time.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> How much of the English has changed since the original Shakespeare to the Shakespeare we have today, I mean the English we have today?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Well if Shakespeare suddenly appeared in the 21st century he would be almost illiterate because back in those days English had a vocabulary of about 150,000 words, whereas now the vocabulary of English is one of the highest in the world. I think 300,000 now, probably more, so Shakespeare wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make himself understood if he came back today, so in a way the vocabulary he&rsquo;s using is really easy. But of course English has changed from that era from middle English until contemporary, English keeps changing even if you talk to your grandparents, well not just English, all languages change and develop over time so even if you talk to your grandparents they&rsquo;re going to use a slightly different variety of the language you&rsquo;re speaking.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> But wait a minute. You&rsquo;re saying that his English is easy? When I read it it doesn&rsquo;t seem easy, it seems pretty tough!</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Eucharia:</strong> Well that&rsquo;s because his English was used in a different way. So some words and some grammatical structures are no longer in English, they&rsquo;ve fallen out of usage except when we read stuff like Shakespeare and then for us it seems almost like a foreign language because we don&rsquo;t have these grammatical structures any more and we don&rsquo;t use English in this way anymore.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ok thanks.</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>Nitya, in the U.S. we have many different parts of the country and people are very different. What about India?

(Yes) Yeah, and can you talk about the food in Italy?</font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Marion:</strong> Sure, I'd love to. I love Italian food.</font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>I know, it's so good.</font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Marion:</strong> Yeah, well, I suppose everybody thinks immediately of pasta and pizza, right?</font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, right, right, right.</font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Marion: They're the most, the two most common types of Italian food and they are really good, I mean, there's just no comparison I think to the pasta and the pizza that we get in other countries, also the ice cream actually in Italy is just different from any other country in the world I think. They really, they really have the number one on those three items I think. But apart from that, I mean there's a whole world of Italian food and it's all really, really good. I mean, the first time I lived in Italy I lived in Genoa, so that was by the sea. Obviously there is a lot of seafood involved in the cooking. Um, fish stews and that kind of thing and they were really, really good, also that region around Geneoa is where pesto originated, so you know the basil sauce (oh, yeah) Yeah, that from Ligiuriea, which is the area around Geneoa, so while I lived in Geneoa, I think I must have had some form of a pesto dish, at least once a week, but I loved it. It's one of my favorite tastes, actually, pesto. </font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, pesto's great.</font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Marion:</strong> Yeah, yeah, you can add it to anything and it tastes great. I put it on my sandwiches sometimes.</font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Really.</font></p>           <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Marion:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, so Italian food, it's quite difficult tp talk about Italian food really because in Italy there are so many different regions, so all over the country each region has it's own special dish, or special dishes, so the food can really vary from the North to the South, in the north for example, in some areas you can find food that's more like german food or in the south it's more mediteraran like greek food for example. It tends that direction.</font></p>           <p></p>           <p><br />           </p>                 "
"                  <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Simon, how old is your son now?</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> He's just over three months now.</p>           <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so it should be pretty <span class=""audionotes"">fresh in your memory</span>. Do you remember what it was like the day he was born?</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> Yeah, sure. I was in the operating room.</p>           <p><strong>Todd:</strong> No kidding. The delivery room.</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> In the delivery room. Not the operating room. Sorry. Well, the do operate, kind of, but the delivery room so.</p>           <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, let's go to the very beginning, like your at home, like what happened?</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> So I was, as usual it happens when you never expect it, and it came a couple of days earlier than we thought, and she had <span class=""audionotes"">labor pains</span> at about 4 o'clock in the morning.</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> Then we took her to the hospital. I took a couple pictures of her, just for the buddies, Hey, look at my better half in pain. </p>           <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. So you got the hospital by car, by taxi. Were you driving fast?</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> I think we went by car and then I said, and then I went back home to get breakfast and then because labor usually takes a long time so I thought we'd have time but, I went home for breakfast and and went back to the hospital and she was already on the table in the delivery room table.</p>           <p> She was quite fast. It took about three hours I guess which is on the quick side of delivery but when I saw here she was a total different person. She was like not a real human being because the pain was so hard, like <span class=""audionotes"">delirious</span> or subconcious but I think all woman are like that because I saw a couple other women and they looked like they were zombies. That's why I said, like they say women have a higher threshold for pain. It's true. I think men would die.</p>           <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. Right.</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> But having said that, it was quite a <span class=""audionotes"">mind-boggling</span> experience, you know, like all of a sudden there's this little putple lump in front of you and it goes to purple to skin color before your eyes. (Wow) Yeah, and yeah, it's awake. A human being.</p>           <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So the baby cries instantly when comes out.</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> I don't think it really cries that much. It doesn't have that image that many of us have that the doctor slaps the, and then cries like a baby, but yeah, maybe it <span class=""audionotes"">wimpers</span> a little bit every now and then. It's for the most part, quiet.</p>           <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, I'm sure it was an amazing day. That's cool. Thanks Simon.</p>           <p><strong>Simon:</strong> Yeah, no problem.</p>           <p><br />           </p>               "
"<p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Ruth, you&#39;re from Ireland.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yes, that&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> And could you talk a little bit about the government in Ireland, like do you have a president or a prime minister?</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> In fact, we have both. We have a president, Mary McAleese, and then there&#39;s another set, another <span class=""audionotes"">ruling body</span>, where the head is called the Taoiseach, which is Irish for Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister at the moment is a man called Bertie Ahern.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> So you have two Prime Ministers.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>We have a president and then we have a Prime Minister.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and the woman is the</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> The woman is the President. Mary McAleese is the president.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, well, who actually has the power? Who makes the decisions?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>Normally I think it&#39;s the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, that makes most of the decisions, and he&#39;s over the government. He decides the government.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, and what&#39;s that title called, Taoiseach.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Taoiseach</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Taoiseach</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> It&#39;s Irish.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so that&#39;s like <span class=""audionotes"">Gaelic</span>.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. There are still some parts of Ireland that&#39;s the Gaelic and, and also because it&#39;s one of the official languages. A lot of things will have an Irish name and an English name as well.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> So how do you choose the Taoiseach.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> The Taoiseach is chosen by the people. So we vote in the Prime Minister, but we also vote in the President as well. We get to choose both.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, well, that&#39;s quite interesting. Do the <span class=""audionotes"">elections</span> happen at the same time?</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> No, usually they happen seperately.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so what&#39;s the point of having the President?</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t really know. I&#39;m not big into politics, so I&#39;m not sure how the whole thing works.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, right.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> But I just know that we have a president as well.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, have you ever had a female Taoiseach, a female Prime Minister?</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> There&#39;s never been a female Taoiseach, only female presidents. We&#39;ve had two female presidents. Mary McAleese and before her, Mary Robinson.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, now is Ireland do most of the people vote? Do you have a <span class=""audionotes"">high voter turnout</span>?</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Quite a lot of people do vote. Mainly, older people, though. Younger people don&#39;t vote so much.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> That&#39;s not good.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> No, not very good at all.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, I think in the states it&#39;s like 50%, or going down.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> It&#39;s probably that, but maybe <span class=""audionotes"">on the lower side</span>.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, well, thanks Ruth.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> No problem.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Joel:</strong> So, if I go to Ireland, what kind of food do you recommend that I eat?</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> The nicest things are probably Irish <span class=""audionotes"">stew</span>, which is made with lamb and also it&#39;s quite famous for it&#39;s seafood. Every year in Galway, there&#39;s an oyster festival.</p><p><strong>Joel: </strong>Oysters are big</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Oysters are quite popular.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong> And you already mentioned Guinness. Does every one drink Guinness or are there other big</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>No, <span class=""audionotes"">Guiness isn&#39;t drunk</span> that much my young people, more by older people who drink it, and also Irish coffee is really nice. It&#39;s like coffee with sugar and whisky in it and cream that floats on the top.</p><p><strong>Joel: </strong>Really, people drink that in the morning?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>No.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> More as a dessert, after your dinner, as a dessert.</p><p><strong>Joel: </strong>And just for places to travel around Ireland, what are the big sightseeing places.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>If you&#39;re in the city, there&#39;s a lot of shopping. There&#39;s also Trinity College, which is the oldest college in Dublin that has a book called The Book of Kells which is a really old book that was handdrawn by monks in Ireland that&#39;s really beautiful. There&#39;s also a place called Newgrange in Kildare which is an old <span class=""audionotes"">burial site</span> and on the shortest day of the year it is built in such a way that the sunshines directly through the door and into the very center of the <span class=""audionotes"">chamber</span>. Other than that. If you want nightlife the best place to go is probably Galway. Galway is really popular.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong> Galway! I would have thought Dublin.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Dublin is popular but it&#39;s quite expensive and a lot of people, if they want a weekend away from Dublin will go to Galway.</p><p><strong>Joel: </strong>Actually, from say London, what is the best way to get to Galway or to get to Dublin?</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>To get to Dublin, flight is the best way, but you can probably get a return ticket if you book in advance for maybe the equivalent of 6,000 (Yen) return and it only takes fifty minutes.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong> OK.</p><p><strong>Ruth: </strong>To get to Galway, probably from Dublin you can get the train. The train is probably the easiest way, but it does take a few hours.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong> And then in the cities themselves, is there a good train system, or does everyone drive a car?</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> In Dublin city there is a train to the suburbs but often it&#39;s delayed or, you know, not on time. It&#39;s pretty bad, and can be a bit expensive and also the intercity trains can be quite expensive. A lot of people have cars but if you live in the city, because there&#39;s so much traffic it can be quite hard getting around in a car and sometimes it&#39;s better to wait for the bus.</p><p><strong>Joel:</strong> Oh, I see. I think I&#39;m gonna need some help when I go out there.</p><p><strong>Ruth:</strong> Probably if you&#39;re visiting, yeah.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p align=""left""><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> So, you&#39;re from a smaller island. What kind of concerns do people on your island have or what kind of concerns do you have? </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> For the world you mean? </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> Right. Right.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> Well recently, when I was in high school I had a friend&#39;s aunt who died from AIDS and she was probably the first <span class=""audionotes"">victim</span> of AIDS, the first AIDS victim in our country and from then on I&#39;ve had a concern about AIDS. I think it&#39;s a very sad issue that should be--people should be concerned with at present and being at a university that is in Asia at the moment I think that the country that I&#39;m living at now (which is Japan). They have this issue but the thing is their cultural understanding is a bit limited to a certain degree whereby they&#39;re not allowed to accept the fact that there are AIDS victims. So I think that like other countries Japan should be one of the countries that should be concerned with AIDS, should have projects and should have workshops and lectures to discuss <span class=""audionotes"">certain things</span>. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> You&#39;re involved in those sort of things here aren&#39;t you?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> Yes I am. I&#39;ll be organizing an event particularly for the AIDS lectures and workshops which will be held in December. We&#39;ll be discussing and we would like to come up with a summary which basically teaches Asian students, basically Japanese students about the importance of accepting AIDS in their community and how they should be aware of it and how they should be on the safe side rather than on the not-so-safe side. So...yeah.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> I see. So it sounds like you keep yourself very busy.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> One has to be.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> I don&#39;t know when you have time to study.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> I put in time for that as well.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> What will you actually teach them at the conference like specific things to make them aware?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia: </strong>A lecture. We have lectures which is basically done by doctors or health clinic individuals who know more about AIDS. Then we facilitate students from our university who have researched or who have had previous experience with the disease or who have worked at a <span class=""audionotes"">medical institute</span> for example or have worked with people who have AIDS before. We use these individuals to be <span class=""audionotes"">facilitators</span> whereby we have workshops and they will teach people who will be coming to our conference or our meeting about the program. What they do is they give out condoms and we write posters and we inform them of issues of how AIDS comes about, the origins of AIDS anyways. How it comes about, what should be done when you have it, who you should be consulting with, what other diseases or sickness or how you can actually get AIDS. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">And we also, the other things we do is we inform them of how important the victims of AIDS--we should actually be supporting them as well. Like, that&#39;s what we teach them we give ideas of how these families, these victims, what they go through when they are having the disease, how their families <span class=""audionotes"">oppose</span> them. Some people don&#39;t really accept their children once they have AIDS for example. So what we do is that we teach individuals that in a humane sort of way, a disease which kills and is caused probably by either your own choice is something that you also have to have that concern for them. You have to say, Oh I&#39;m sorry that you have AIDS but would you like support? This is the important thing. I think it&#39;s basically to do with a humane cultural view. Not cultural view but a more humane global view. </font></p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p align=""left""><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> I&#39;m sorry Patricia, I&#39;m completely <span class=""audionotes"">ignorant</span> about any history in Samoa. You said there&#39;s an American and then the Western side? And who was that originally --was that a colony of another country?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> The American Samoan territory is an American territory itself, even until now it&#39;s still under the States (the United States) but Western Samoa, which in 1997 has recently changed the name, to Samoa alone, they were under the British colony, German colony as well. And then in 1919 they became a New Zealand mandate.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> What does that mean?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> It means that they were under --like you are aware that New Zealand is under the British rule? But they have their own independent state itself. It&#39;s like that whereby Samoa is a British country --colony but it&#39;s being mandated, or taken care of, by New Zealand which that anything -- we don&#39;t have a, for example, we don&#39;t have an army. We use the New Zealand army to take care of us. Any political decisions that we need to make it has to be done by the New Zealand...</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> And so the same is true of the American side?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> I don&#39;t think so. I believe they are very different. They are more under-- OK, <span class=""audionotes"">to a certain degree</span> but the American Samoan individuals are more Americanized. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> I see.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> Like, from our side, the Samoan side, we&#39;re more on traditionally-based rules. Even though we listen and even though we need a decision made by the British and the New Zealand mandates but we&#39;re more on a local-- we have a matai system which means that we have leaders from each village which counsels us. These are the only individuals who are allowed to decide. But after our decision we give it to the New Zealand and British <span class=""audionotes"">mandate</span>. For the American Samoan people, the who system is governed by America. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> So have you lived in England or the United States before?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> No. Not at all. I haven&#39;t been there yet?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> And what about just the popular culture? Like, do you watch American TV shows?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> Yes.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel: </strong>Or British? Or New Zealand? </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia: </strong>With Samoan families we have some people on our island like for example I have a friend who is in the university now. Her father is from the other island, the American Samoa, her family is more based on the American system side where they watch American movies and so on. And then you have people who are more on a New Zealand basic, like, view. And Australian lifestyle.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> You know in the United States, we never see New Zealand TV or Australian TV or British TV and I always think that people from other countries, they see American movies and American television but Americans don&#39;t see any of that from countries outside the US so we have kind of a bit of a <span class=""audionotes"">closed culture</span> but you watch also British and New Zealand, so you know all of it. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia:</strong> That&#39;s basically the interesting thing about living on an island. You don&#39;t get to decide which country you are supposed to be, who you are supposed to be on the same side with. <span class=""audionotes"">Basically what you do is</span>, when you are born into a certain family, they have certain rules, they have a certain sort of way of living, which means that if you are from a family that has British lines or American lines, basically you will have both the lifestyles of a British and American normal Somoan family.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Joel:</strong> So you are much more multicultural.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Patricia: </strong>Probably.</font></p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Lucinda, has Kwame been to New Zealand?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Yeah, he has.

It was his first trip to New Zealand.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> It was quite funny actually because, he&#39;s, I&#39;m from New Zealand in the Western Country and I&#39;m from the country and he&#39;s from Africa and he&#39;s from the city so a lot of <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">people assume that</span></span> if your from Africa you&#39;re from the country and if you&#39;re from a Western Country, you&#39;re from the city and when he came to visit us I think he was a little bit shocked to end up in the middle of the country and my family thought he&#39;s be able to, <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">he&#39;d know his way around a spade</span></span> and a shovel and and be able to plant trees which is what my parents spent a lot of time doing and so, I think in the beginning he was very, he was quite shocked about the type of lifestyle we had but after awhile he really settled in really well.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> What did you guys do on his trip to New Zealand?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> I taught him to swim. (Really) Kwame, well, he still can&#39;t swim very well. He can float, so we put actually, we, it&#39;s quite embarrassing, but we put a life jacket on him from, cause we have race boats, so we put a life jacket on him, and just sent him out into the water on his back</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would work.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> So we were quite shocked that he could&#39;t swim because coming from an island country, I have never before met anyone in my life that couldn&#39;t swim. I learned to swim when I was maybe 4 years old and we have swimming lessons at school so at least you don&#39;t go to school, there&#39;s no way that you can&#39;t swim.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So are you a good swimming teacher? Did you teach him successfully?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">I gave up halfway through it</span></span>. My mom had to teach him because I&#39;m very small and my mom used to be a lifeguard so she, she was able to, cause Kwame is so big. He&#39;s over 6 foot, so and I&#39;m almost 5 foot so it&#39;s kind of a bit, a bit dangerous for me to be teaching him how to swim.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> What else do you remember about his first trip to New Zealand?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Oh, gosh. I remember that my parents, they really, really loved him and my family spent the whole time fighting over who got to spend time with Kwame and I think that my parents want to <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">adopt</span></span> me out and adopt Kwame instead. I really think they prefer him. He&#39;s the good son.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> What did Kwame think of New Zealand?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> He really liked it. He, my stepfather, he goes fishing all the time and Kwame, coming from the city, he, when my stepfather asked him to go fishing he kind of <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">squirmed at the thought</span></span> of the start, but after coming back fishing, he asked every night after that to go fishing (really) and now all he talks about is the large snapper that he caught in New Zealand.</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Lucinda, you have a very natural family, I mean they&#39;re really into nature and the environment.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Yeah, pretty much. I think they call us <span class=""audionotes"">tree-huggers</span> or whatever they call them now these days.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, tree huggers! So, do you guys do anything special for like for being sick or anything like that?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Yeah, my autie is a <span class=""audionotes"">naturalpath</span>?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> A naturalpath?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda: </strong>Yeah, I think that&#39;s a new word for, it used to be a homeopath. </font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I see, and what does naturalpath mean?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> It basically means a person that is involved with natural medicine kind of like a doctor but with <span class=""audionotes"">natural remedies</span> instead of <span class=""audionotes"">pharmacuetical medicine</span>.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. OK, so let&#39;s assuming that I get a cold and I&#39;m really sick. What would a natural-path give me?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Basically there is certain, well there is certain drugs that you would give a person that was, had a flu if you were a doctor and there would be a specific drug for that flu or they might just give you penecilin or something strong, with a natural-path they would give you a different range of remedies considering what exact symptoms you had, so they&#39;d give you echinacea if you just had, if you were just feeling down. </font><br /><br /><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. What&#39;s that called?<br /><br /><strong>Lucinda:</strong> echinacea (echinacea) Yeah.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> What is echinacea?<br /><br /><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Ah, that is a, it&#39;s for your <span class=""audionotes"">immune system</span>. It gives you a boost, basically. If you&#39;re feeling kind of down or sick or you&#39;re just not very, have much energy.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Is it a plant?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> It&#39;s, I think it&#39;s a type of a root.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I see</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s a type of plant. They, it&#39;s crushed up and put into tablets, and you can actually, most people now take, not most people, but people that take echinacea now, they often, you can every day of your life.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Every day</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Yeah. It&#39;s very popular in America.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> And it makes you healthy?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, you&#39;re very young, so and assuming that some day, when you have your family, and if you have child that&#39;s sick, would you ever use Western medicine, or would you strictly use the natural-path way?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Well, actually, it depends on how sick the child is. I mean, whenever I was sick as a child, I&#39;d go to the doctor, but it&#39;s not like I wouldn&#39;t give them Western medicine, but if they just had a small cold I would use natural medicines first but if it was anything serious I would give them, I would take them to the doctor definitely and use Western medicine.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Now your aunt who is a natural path, does she ever use Western medicine?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Lucinda:</strong> Oh, yes, yes. Every day people use this natural path medicine. I mean it&#39;s not for, you know natural medicine freaks or anything like that. It&#39;s everyday business people use their medicine. It&#39;s now very popular to be healthy and to eat, to have certain things in your diet that you should be eating and even such as health drink shakes, they sell them in stores such as Starbuck&#39;s now so that is actually a part of natural-path medicines, are those health food energy drinks that have protien powder and stuff.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, well sounds good.</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd: </strong>So Shuan, you mentioned your family, do you have a big family?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> No, I have a <span class=""audionotes"">fairly</span> small family, actually, I&#39;ve only got, including me there&#39;s only four people in my family.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So it&#39;s your mother, your father, you...</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> And my sister.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, and your sister. OK, is your sister younger or older than you?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> She&#39;s younger. She just started university actually.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, so you&#39;re the big brother.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> I am, yeah.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, that&#39;s nice. So where does your family live right now?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> Ah, my mother and my father live in Victoria in Canada and my sister is on the other side of Canada in Montreal in Quebec.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, tell me about your father. What&#39;s your father like?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> My father is <span class=""audionotes"">pretty much</span> the most interesting person I think I know. He all different kinds of stories about his childhood, and his growing up.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Did you grow up in Canada?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> No, he grew up in Liverpool, in England.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, nice, and what does your father do?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> Ah, he was a pilot until five years ago, five years ago, <span class=""audionotes"">it was kind of tragic</span>, but he had a heart attack and he wasn&#39;t allowed to fly anymore.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I&#39;m sorry.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> It&#39;s fine. He makes, he&#39;s pretty much happier now I guess.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so he was OK after the heart attack.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> He&#39;s fine, yeah.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, what about your mother? Does she work?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> My mother, no, she doesn&#39;t. She used to work. In fact my mother and my father met at work. They both worked for Cathay Pacific, which is an airline based in Hong Kong. My mother was a stewardess and my father was a pilot, so they met that way in Osaka actually.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, what a story. OK and what about your sister? You said that she&#39;s a student.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> She&#39;s a student. She&#39;s actually in her first year in McGill. she&#39;s actually in her first year in McGill unversity which is in Quebec. <span class=""audionotes"">I haven&#39;t spoken to her lately so I don&#39;t know how she&#39;s doing.</span></font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, do you know what she studies?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan: </strong>I believe it&#39;s arts and humanities.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So you and your sister, are you similar or quite different?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> Oh, we are definely quite different.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> How so?</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Shuan:</strong> I was the rebelious type. I pretty much laid the foundation for my sister to get all the freedoms that she has, and she doesn&#39;t appreciate any of the things I&#39;ve done so,.. another way that we&#39;re different is that she&#39;s really into arts and drawing and painting and making music where as I&#39;m more into the technical side of things, like I&#39;m into computer making, fixing cars.</font></p><p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So it sounds like your quite different. Well, maybe she&#39;ll listen to this and she&#39;ll appreciate you more.<br />Shuan: I hope so.</font></p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Shuan, you talked about being on a cruise and going to Key West. Were there any other places that you remember that were really good on your trip?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> Yeah, we ended up in Cancun for two days, and I have a really interesting story that I probably <span class=""audionotes"">shouldn&#39;t tell</span>, but I will anyway. Well, the first day it was just normal, pretty much shopping and we <span class=""audionotes"">checked out</span> the local sites and stuff and went to a Mayan, an old Mayan temple (nice) and it was kind of scary. They told us that they had <span class=""audionotes"">human sacrifices</span> and everything there so.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Ooh, gory.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">It was kind of creepy</span> but.</font><strong><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""> </font></strong><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""> On the second day, we went snorkeling and <span class=""audionotes"">we lost track of time</span>. The bus dropped us off at around 12 o&#39;clock and we were supposed to meet back at the bus at around 4 o&#39;clock. Unfortunately for me and my friend, we didn&#39;t have watches, so we went snorkeling, and while we were snorkeling we found these underwater tunnels which were just filled with fish and coral and we basically lost track of time and we went swimming through all of them, and, or yeah, another story about that is we actually saw a sea lion.<br /><br /><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, really.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> A sea lion, yeah. It just came right up next to us so we added that and.<br /><br /><strong>Todd: </strong>It let you touch it?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> It let us touch it, yeah.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> That is cool.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> We swam around with the sea lion for a little bit.</font><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""> And then we headed back, cause we thought it was around 3 o&#39;clock, but unfortunately it was 4:30 and the bus had already left.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, no.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> So we had to rent a taxi, and I would say that taxi drivers in Mexico are probably the most dangerous taxi drivers ever. On the way back, I noticed that his speedometer wasn&#39;t working, and we must have been going around a 130 kilometers per hour down this road. It was only a two lane road. One way for one-way traffic, and one way for the other way traffic, but he was driving on the shoulder of the lane we wanted to get on so he was passing trucks and cars and motorbikes, just all on the shoulder and he basically drove 130 kilometers per hour, right down the side of the road.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> And we got to the ferry terminal where we were supposed to catch the ferry back to the cruise ship, or back to another island which the cruise ship was parked at we actually missed the ferry by three minutes.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh!<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> Yeah, so they told us that the next ferry would be three hours later and we just couldn&#39;t afford to wait because our ship was going to leave, so we couldn&#39;t think of anything else but to charter an airplane. So this is all on my dad&#39;s credit card, mind you, so we chartered an airplane and we flew to the island which was about a ten minutes flight, not that long, but it ended up costing us 500 U.S. dollars<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, man.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> And that was just to get back to the cruise ship, and it was just the worst time I&#39;ve ever spent there.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, man, what a story. Well, what did you dad say about the credit card bill?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> Um, I got billed for it a few months later.</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Shuan, you took a cruise and the cruise left he U.S.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> It left yeah. It left Florida.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and did you only stay at sea or did you make stops on your cruise ship?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> We actually made 4 different stops. I cannot remember the last place but the first place we stopped was Key West. The second place we stopped was Peurta Vearta, and the third place was Cancun, and the last place I just can&#39;t remember the name.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Actually, what about Key West? Is Key West a nice place?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> Key West is a really nice place: all the different buildings and stores are actually <span class=""audionotes"">constructed</span> to make, or constructed to look like <span class=""audionotes"">historical buildings</span>. They are all made out of stone and wood.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I see, so they are supposed to look like the first people that came from Europe that built.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> Yeah, they look almost Gothic in style.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Now Key West, is that the U.S. or is that it&#39;s own little <span class=""audionotes"">territory</span>.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> Ah, Key West. I don&#39;t know.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know either and I&#39;m American, so<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> I actually, if I think back, I do believe that everybody drove on the left-hand side of the road, and I think I recall somebody saying that it was part of the U. K.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really. OK, interesting. So anyway, <span class=""audionotes"">besides</span> the buildings, what&#39;s Key West like? Is it like a good place for adventure, a good place for night life?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> It&#39;s a good place for outdoor sea sports.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, yeah, for example, like what can you do?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> Well, to tell the truth I was really <span class=""audionotes"">sunburnt</span> the day I got to Key West because I spent too much time on the cruise ship on the top deck.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh that&#39;s terrible.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> So I had to get in the water and I had to get in quick so the very first day we went to, me and my friend Jason, we just went to beach and swam around for most of the day. We went with snorkels and flippers. We basically just dived down to as deep as we could to avoid the sunlight.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, smart move. Oh, that&#39;s nice. So did you actually do any scuba diving when you were in Key West?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> That&#39;s what I did on the second day, yeah. Jason and I, we really wanted to go and try some scuba diving, although we had to go with an instructor, it was still a really good experience.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> So then you go down in the water. What happens? You go down in the water and what do you see and what&#39;s it like being underwater.<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> To breathe underwater is one skill that I really wish I had and, but it was magnificent in Key West. We saw all these different kinds of fish. It was just so many colors, and it was just beautiful, the water was just sky blue all the way down and it was just absolutely, yeah, just beautiful.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Are there any dangers when you&#39;re down under the water?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan: </strong>Well, they say that sharks are dangerous. We actually did get shark knives in case any sharks did approach us, but in most cases sharks think that you&#39;re big and they do try to avoid you.<br /><br /><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I got it. But you say you have a shark knife that there&#39;s an actual knife you can stab a shark with?<br /><br /><strong>Shuan:</strong> It&#39;s a knife that you use to cut yourself free from lines, from ropes. If you need to you can stab a shark with it. Yes, but</font></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>Adrienne, we are talking about your family. Can describe the people in your family? Like, what&#39;s your mother like, and your father like and your sister?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> OK, well, let me start with my mother. I&#39;m hoping she doesn&#39;t listen to this, though, maybe. My mother is a very interesting. <span class=""audionotes"">She has a great sense of humor</span> and she&#39;s a very kind woman, very generous woman. She&#39;s also not afraid to say what she is thinking, which is a quality I admire about her very much.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>What about your father? How would you describe your dad?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> <span class=""audionotes"">My dad is probably the nicest man you&#39;ll ever meet</span>. He&#39;s very kind, very generous, very warm-heart and he&#39;s really a good guy and I love him very much.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> And actually I met your father and he&#39;s a very big guy.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>He is. Which means he has a very big heart.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> He is. My dad&#39;s very tall and <span class=""audionotes"">takes up a lot of space</span>. It&#39;s true.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Gentle-Giant, right?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Something like that. Yeah. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, now you have a sister. Is she younger or older?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Younger sister.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, younger sister. How would you describe her personality?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> My sister is actually quite similar to my dad in that she has a very good heart and <span class=""audionotes"">she&#39;s very generous and very open</span>, very friendly and giving personality and she is probably the only person on the planet who can make me laugh at any moment.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> That&#39;s nice.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong><span class=""audionotes"">She cracks me up</span>. So, She&#39;s got a great sense of humor, but part of that probably comes from being sisters too.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Now you said that your sister is very similar to your father, so you are very similar to your mother?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Coincidentally, yes, actually. My mother and I have a lot in common in terms of our personality, which means that we get along very well and then sometimes we don&#39;t. Cause we remind each other of each other perhaps.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> So, like what traits do you have in common?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> I would say that we both very often say what we&#39;re thinking, which not everybody likes all of the time.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>I think being outspoken is good.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>It can be. It can be which is why I think it&#39;s a good quality but it sometimes can lead to more conflict than you&#39;re prepared for.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Right. Well, it sounds like you have a nice balance.</p><p><strong>Adrienne:</strong> Mm, we do.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, Adrienne we are going to talk about your family. How many people are in your family?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> In <span class=""audionotes"">my immediate family</span>, there are four of us: my mother, father and my younger sister and I.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, and now do you see each other a lot. I mean, do you get together with your family often?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>I see them actually <span class=""audionotes"">fairly frequently considering we all live very far away</span> from each other.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, yeah. Where does everyone live?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Well, I live in Tokyo and my mother is living now in Hong Kong and my father lives in Minneapolis and my sister lives in Milwaukee which is not far from Minneapolis but she&#39;s a flight attendant, so she&#39;s rarely in Milwaukee. She actually flies to the Middle East and Europe mainly.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Wow. That&#39;s pretty cool. You&#39;ve got this family like everywhere.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>It is. It&#39;s very funny. We often go online to chat with each other and to say hello and <span class=""audionotes"">we&#39;ll be spread out completely across the globe</span>. It&#39;s very funny.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> So, do you actually go and see your mother in Hong Kong, or your sister in the Middle East?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> I haven&#39;t been to the Middle East. She&#39;s never there for long enough to visit, but I have been to Hong Kong several times to see my mom.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> And how as Hong Kong?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Oh, it&#39;s a great city. Really interesting city. Lots of water. Obviously it&#39;s a harbor city, and mountains and lots of greenery so it&#39;s really beautiful for such a big city. <span class=""audionotes"">It&#39;s not completely concrete</span>, like a lot of major cities are.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Now, we have vacation coming up. Are you going to be going home and seeing any of your family?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>I hope so. Yeah, my plan is to go back to America for the holiday and visit everyone there for a couple of weeks. Say hello to my family my grandmothers, my cousins, my sister, my friends, everyone who is there.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So is everyone going to be there, your mom, your dad, and your sister?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m hoping that everyone can come together for some kind of <span class=""audionotes"">family reunion</span>. Like I said since we all live so far away.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, I hope you all make it.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Me, too.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, Adrienne, you are really into jewelry. You fix jewelry. Do you know a lot about gems and stones and things like that?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>No, I don&#39;t know a lot, but I know what I like.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> So what kind of stuff do you like?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Well, <span class=""audionotes"">I&#39;m actually not a big fan of precious stones</span> like diamonds, rubies, emeralds. I think they are very beautiful but for everyday wear I prefer, I think they are called semi-precious stones, but I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;m right about that either.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, what are some semi-precious stones?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Well, I think either they fall into the semi-precious stone or the rock category. I&#39;m not sure, but one example is I like Jade very much.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Jade.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Jade.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, what does Jade look like?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Jade is usually green, although you can find white and yellow and even pink Jade, maybe other colors too, but the most popular and the most common Jade you find is green and <span class=""audionotes"">various shades of green</span>. You have to be careful though when you buy Jade that that is hasn&#39;t been dyed by the jeweler because very often they will do... they still call it Jade but <span class=""audionotes"">it&#39;s actually been injected with a color</span> to make it greener than it would be naturally, and I don&#39;t care for that bright green color. I like the natural, natural green color of Jade, so and I just like, <span class=""audionotes"">it&#39;s a little bit translucent</span>. If you hold it up to light, you can see light coming through it. It&#39;s a really beautiful stone.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> What other rocks do you like? I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re rocks.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> We don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. I wish I new more about this now that you&#39;re asking me. Um, carnelian is another one that I like a lot. Carnelian is a red stone. <span class=""audionotes"">It&#39;s got kind of an orange tint to it</span>, so it&#39;s orangish-red color and it makes beautiful beads, so very often you will see necklaces and earrings made from carnelian beads, and it polishes very nicely as well.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, so you like Jade and you like carnelian. Anything else?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Yeah, actually, I like all other kinds of rocks, even quartz, crystals, all of those kinds of things that you can wear, but I don&#39;t like the shiny crystals, the ones that are trying to look like diamonds or cubic-zerkonia. Yeah, I don&#39;t like it to be shiny. I like very natural looking rock. So it should be matte, and also a little but rough on the edges so you can see that it really was a rock, that was maybe mined or pulled out the ground. I don&#39;t know. So those are my favorite kinds but I guess I wouldn&#39;t mind getting a diamond or two here and there.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>Hello, Adrienne.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Hi, Todd.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>You know Adrienne <span class=""audionotes"">I must compliment you</span>. You always have the nicest jewelry.</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Oh, thank you. That&#39;s a nice thing to say.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Where do you get it?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Various places. A lot of jewelry I pick up interesting pieces when I&#39;m traveling, but also a lot of my jewelry I make.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Get out of here!</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>No. Serious.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>You make your own Jewelry?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Yeah, some of it. <span class=""audionotes"">It&#39;s kind of a hobby of mine that just developed in the last few years</span>.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Now, that&#39;s pretty cool that you make your own jewelry. Like, how do you make jewelry? What&#39;s the process?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Well, it depends on what you want to make of course, but I go to the jewelry shop or the bead shop usually and they have all of the different pieces, different kinds of beads, different kinds of chains, different kinds of claps and wire and all of the things you need to put on a necklace or bracelet together.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>And you just fiddle it together?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Yeah, usually <span class=""audionotes"">I have an idea in mind, a color scheme</span> in mind or maybe I&#39;m thinking I bought a new skirt and I want something to go with it so actually it was a hobby born out of necessity because I couldn&#39;t afford to keep up with my buying accessories all the time, so.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Cool. So, how did you learn how to do this? Did you take a class?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>No, I probably should actually. But no, it actually started not too long ago. A friend of mine had a really nice looking necklace that was falling apart. and I looked at it closely and I thought,  Oh, this should be easy to fix. She couldn&#39;t find a jeweler who would touch it because they were worried about it breaking and then they would be responsible, and so I said, Well, let me try. Of course I don&#39;t want to be responsible either but, let me try as a friend, and so I went to the story and found the wire and and clasp and everything we needed to fix it and it turned out actually really nice and she was so pleased with it that I decided to fix a few other pieces that had been lying in my closet <span class=""audionotes"">untouched</span> for a long time and fix them. They turned out really nice and then I went back and started finding more interesting pieces to work with and so, yeah, it was just sort of a slow development.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, when you make the jewelry, what tools do you use? What do you got?</p><p><strong>Adrienne: </strong>Usually you need some kind of a wire cutter or scissors depending on weather your working with string or thin wire. I recommend thin wire just because <span class=""audionotes"">it lasts longer</span>. It&#39;s stronger. String can wear out. You have a needle nose plier, so it&#39;s a specific type of pliers that have a very pointed end on it. Needle-nose they call it, and that&#39;s used to clamp some of the claps together and also just to help pull the thread through the beads, that kind of thing. And then, you need to buy separate clasps to be able to wire everything and to be able to wear it basically. So it&#39;s actually really straight forward and very simple. It just sounds and looks very complicated, so it makes everyone more impressed than they should be I think.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, the jewelry store people probably don&#39;t want to hear that.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Wendi: </strong>OK, so I have never in my life been to a <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">Wiccan wedding</span></span>, and I want to know exactly what goes down?</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong>OK, a Wiccan wedding, unlike other weddings, it&#39;s about their religion but it&#39;s more about celebrating the love of the couple and then they just kind of bring in <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">the forces of nature</span></span>: earth, wind, fire and whatever the other one is and, yeah, basically it was really a celebration of their love, and the bridesmaids and the groomsmen stood around the couple in a circle and kind of had to send <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">positive energy</span></span>. It was a very <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">hippie kind of lovefest wedding</span></span>, and unlike traditional flowers there was leaves.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Oh, that sounds so beautiful. On the floor kind of thing?</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong> On the floor, yeah, and it was in the autumn so they were all different colors.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Wow, that sounds beautiful.</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Was it outside or inside?</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong>It was inside but then the reception was outside.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Wow, so it held in a church?</p><p><strong>Rachel: I </strong>t was, no, it was not held in a church because there is no real church for Wiccan people. They just kind of, if anything, meet in small groups and talk about nature and things like that.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Cool. That sounds really interesting.</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Yeah, but it did have kind of like and <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">archbishop</span></span> for Wiccan, people come in a very brightly colored cloak</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong> And he was waving around a kind of staff.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Yeah. Weird.</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Yeah. And they actually had to jump a witches broom at the end of it.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Ah, I&#39;ve seen that before, I think in the Southern U.S. that&#39;s kind of a custom or something like that. Have you seen that custom anywhere else?</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong> No, just at the Wiccan wedding.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>I&#39;ve heard of that jumping over the broom before. I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;ve seen that before, but yeah, that&#39;s interesting. Tell me a little about what the man and woman getting married were wearing?</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong> Um, regular traditional outfits. It was more the man who was conducting the wedding the ceremony that had something strange on. The bride wore a regular white gown with a veil and the groom wore a tuxedo with a tie.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Right.</p><p><strong>Rachel: </strong> All the bridesmaids had the same dress on picked out by the bride. Maybe instead though the jewelry was much more gothic style. Crosses and things like that. But yeah, everybody looked like a regular wedding except for hippie looking guy.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Wow. Sounds like a really awesome event.</p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, Jeff, we&#39;re talking about odd jobs. What&#39;s a job that you would like to have? What&#39;s a job that you think would be one of the coolest jobs to have?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Difficult question, Todd. I guess the job that I would like to do, it might not be the coolest job, but I think it would be a fun job and I think it would pay OK, would be running a small tour company, so taking small groups of people to <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">exotic locations</span></span> like India and having a sort of very <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">intimate tour</span></span> so that you don&#39;t stand out in the country you&#39;re in and the people you&#39;re taking on the tour get to sort of <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">blend in</span></span> and see some of the real views of the country.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Now, that actually surprises me a little bit because you&#39;re a very worldly person Jeff and you&#39;re very <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">conscious about</span> </span>culture and things like that. Don&#39;t you worry that if you have a job where you&#39;re bringing people into another culture that you maybe <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">ruin it or spoil the culture</span></span> a little bit?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Yeah, Todd, that&#39;s a good point, but I think it&#39;s inevitable that they&#39;re going to go anyway, so you can take them and take them on a very low impact tour, where it doesn&#39;t disturb the country so much or you can let them go with a big organization that sort of takes them through a country so it&#39;s like a zoo, where there&#39;s no interaction and they&#39;re sort of looking, looking through a window so I think if I take them it will be less destructive to the culture.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, well, so there are a lot of tour companies out there, so if you had a tour company what would you do differently? Like how would your tour company be different than the others?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I think I would try to use a lot of local people in the service so instead of bringing people over with you and having them do everything, I&#39;d sort of bring a lot amount of employees over and let the locals do everything. Let the locals guide, let the locals drive, try to include the locals as much as possible and it would be a better experience for the tourist as well.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> So, I think you mentioned that you&#39;d like to have your company for India. What is it about India? Why would you want to have a tour company there?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> Many people don&#39;t like India because it&#39;s dirty, noisy. It&#39;s smelly, hot. It&#39;s special place and I think you sort of lose a bit of your the social greed or possessional habits that you have, that you don&#39;t even notice you have them, that you acquire them when you living in the West and when you go to India they&#39;re stripped away. So I think it&#39;s just a special place and it&#39;s cheap and it&#39;s exotic and it&#39;s interesting and Indian people are beautiful people, really fun to be around.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"                  <p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, Jeff, we're talking about odd jobs. Good jobs, bad jobs, strange jobs we've done. What's an odd job you've had Jeff? </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong> Todd, one of my oddest odd jobs might be was when I was backpacking through Europe after university, I <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">ran out of money</span> </span>in Israel and there's an organization called a Kibutz, where it's <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">communal living</span></span> and you can do a job and they give you your <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">room and board</span></span>.They they don't pay you in money but they give you food and lodging and a good experience of living with the Israelis so I worked on a fish pond. A fish pond. And it means raising fish, growing fish that they are going to sell in the supermarket. And so <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">what that entails was</span></span> I got up in the morning and we fed the fish. You has a machine that put fish food, fish pellets into the lake, into the fish pond and then you'd have to clean up the fish pond, and you'd have to make some calls to the markets, to the supermarkets and find out who wanted what, when they needed it and make sure that your system, your fish could be ready when they needed it and it was beautiful because it was working with nature sort of out in the Israeli countryside and it was sunny and warm everyday. You were working with other <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">good quality guys</span></span>, so it was good. It was an interesting job, very odd, odd job, and it was a good experience as well. </p>           <p><br />           </p>           <p><br />           </p>               "
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, now Jeff, I&#39;ve know you for along time. You are <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">a very resourceful person</span></span>. You always have these <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">crazy jobs</span></span>, and recently you had at a hospital, but you weren&#39;t a doctor. Could you please describe your job?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Todd, it was a pharmaceutical company clinic that I was working at and it was, I was <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">a guinea pig</span></span>, a medical guinea pig which means that a new drug that is being introduced into a foreign country must be tested on an individual before it can be sold on the open market so I&#39;m a guinea pig. It&#39;s tested on me, and once the results come back and everything is OK then it is sold to the public.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> So when you say you were a guinea pig, like what did they do to you everyday, or what was your routine?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Well let me qualify that it&#39;s not good work. You can&#39;t really make a living at it and bring up children but it pays very well,..., very very well. It&#39;s very <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">lucrative</span></span> so that&#39;s one of the enticements for doing this kind of work but it&#39;s just, your day is you get up are administered the drug, for example a flu medicine and then you remain in the clinic all day long and you read and write. You have the freedom to do whatever you like, but it&#39;s very monitored so you can&#39;t leave the clinic but you can do whatever you like to do in the clinic.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, so you&#39;re in the clinic and what would a daily routine be? What do you do? Do you get up and exercise or what?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>A daily routine varies between individuals, so with me there were twelve on the study, twelve young men, and some of the guys would get up late and sleep until noon. Well, they would get up for breakfast. You have to have breakfast at seven a.m. and what you eat is monitored and then you eat lunch at noon and you eat your dinner at six. In between a lot of the guys read or watched movies or played video games. I used my time by doing yoga or reading, doing work, studying Japanese. I tried to use my time a little bit constructively, whereas some of the other guys sort of just used it as a vacation.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, so you&#39;re in this clinic for a week or whatever. So when you get out from being <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">sequestered</span></span> in there, what is the first thing you do?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>The first thing that I did when I got out was..no, OK, no....I can&#39;t say that. The second thing I did when I got out of the clinic was have a nice meal because the food in the clinic wasn&#39;t very good so, the second thing was that I had a really good meal, a nice meal of food.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Alright, Jeff. Thank you for sharing that.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Alright, so I want to talk a little bit about what <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">people&#39;s impressions</span></span> of you are when they see you&#39;re tattoos, either strangers or people that actually know you.</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> Some people it can be negative. Some people are interested and I have no problems with that if people are interested, and the <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">negative feedback</span></span> I get from it, it&#39;s OK. I know that these people were raised differently or they have different beliefs or ideas and I understand where they&#39;re coming from but, no, it&#39;s hard when people judge you just by face value but it&#39;s not my issue it&#39;s theirs so I&#39;m OK with that.</p><p>Pause 1</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Right. Can you talk a little bit about a negative or really positive experience has been since you&#39;ve had tattoos from other people. Do you have any situations that you can think of?</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> In general I&#39;ve people just give me dirty looks and not like talk to me, or I had one gentleman <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">slap my wrist</span></span> one time when I was trying to get change back. He was being quite angry with me.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Really, because of your tattoo?</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> Because of my tattoo on my wrist. I was holding out my hand and he slapped my wrist and it&#39;s upsetting that somebody gets that angry over your own personal decisions but it&#39;s their issue not mine.</p><p>Pause 2</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Yeah, what about in, kind of, in the tattoo parlor, like what kind of stuff do people talk about? Like, is it just like getting your hair cut, speaking to the barber, talking about what&#39;s going on in your life or?</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> Pretty much, see, I&#39;m friends with my tattoo artist so we talk about, like, we know the same people and we sometimes hang out with some of the same people so we talk about that but a lot of the times we talk about people that come in wanting stupid things on their bodies.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Can you tell me a little about what kind of stupid things people have wanted?</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> Um, there has been people wanting <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">a symbol of a car brand</span></span>, like the make of a car tattooed on them, or just people&#39;s names or just random. A lot of times it&#39;s kanji.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Really?</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> Yeah. A lot of...</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Chinese characters?</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> Chinese characters, and some people find that when they do get those Chinese characters, after the fact, it&#39;s not initially what they thought it meant.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Right, so it&#39;s communication.</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">It&#39;s really ill-researched</span></span> and no reason for it unless that&#39;s your native country.</p><p>Pause 3</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> Right, can you tell me a little about what-- if you&#39;ve ever seen a tattoo that you thought was just so well done.</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong> What was it and describe it?</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong> It was actually a piece on a man and it started from his hip and it was his whole right side of his body, half of his right side and it was flowers and vines and it went around and up to his shoulder and turned into a half-sleeve and it was absolutely beautiful, colorful and just well done. The lines were clean. It was an amazing tattoo.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Wendi:</strong> OK, Rina, I&#39;d like you to tell me about getting your first tattoo.</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong>When I got my first tattoo I was 22 years old and it was supposed to be a very small, maybe one or two hour piece and it&#39;s true what they say. <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">They&#39;re very addictive</span></span> because it turned out to be a 12-hour tattoo on my back and I put a lot of thought into that first tattoo. It took me about three years to come up with the design and the person that did it is still my tattoo artist today. Nobody else has ever tattooed my body.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Wow! When you went in were you expecting <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">to be under the needle</span></span> for twelve hours?</p><p><strong>Rina:</strong> Well, they do it in sessions, so I did the first part in a four-hour session and then you heal for about two to three weeks and then you go back for another three or four hours and I did mine in four three-hour sessions. I did it in four-sessions. Give or take a few hours there.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> So what was the whole experience like, getting a tattoo for the first time? Was it what you expected it to be or did it hurt more?</p><p><strong>Rina:</strong> It wouldn&#39;t have been as bad if somebody didn&#39;t tell me before I went that it&#39;s like <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">a thousand burning scalpels</span></span> going down your body and that was what was on my mind the whole time.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Wow! That sounds painful.</p><p><strong>Rina:</strong> It was painful, but after it was done, like the whole time getting it done, all I could think about was,  Why am I doing this?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> For sure.</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong>This is really stupid. I&#39;m never doing this again but once your finished, it&#39;s like OK, what can I do next.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Wow! When you were getting it done, <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">what was going through your mind</span></span>?</p><p><strong>Rina:</strong> What am I doing?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Seriously.</p><p><strong>Rina:</strong> Yeah. Like I&#39;m never doing this again and it&#39;s still the case now when I got my last one at Christmas, just last Christmas, and the whole time I&#39;m like, What am I doing? This is ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Do you worry at all that it&#39;s not going to turn out well if there&#39;s a big mistake that you&#39;re stuck with something terrible forever?</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong>No, and that just goes with the trust I have in my tattoo artist. It&#39;s more about the pain cause it hurts but you just kind of <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">grind your teeth and bear it</span></span>.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> So you got your first tattoo and kind of, what happens right after you get a tattoo? What kind of care do you need to take care of it or?</p><p><strong>Rina:</strong> You need to keep it clean. Definitely. It&#39;s like an open wound really. You have to keep it clean and not let it dry out so. Many different tattoo artists have different after care remedies and I&#39;ve tried quite a few of them and I&#39;ve kind of been the guinea pig with my tattoo artist with a lot of after care remedies.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong>Some suggest Vaseline. Some suggest simple Lubiderm Lotion. Some tattoo parlors have ointments so basically you wash it with silk that&#39;s not anti-bacterial, that&#39;s just like plain silk and then you let it air dry for ten minutes and then you moisturize it. You keep washing and moisturizing it. The first week maybe three or four times a day.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>You&#39;re a brave woman.</p><p><strong>Rina: </strong>I think so.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, Deanne, so you are a translator?</p><p><strong>Deanne: </strong><span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">Interpreter</span></span>.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Interpreter.</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>What&#39;s the difference between a translator and an interpreter?</p><p><strong>Deanne: </strong>The interpreter serves as a medium between two different people and it&#39;s done spoken. Translators work on their own and they translate documents and sometimes they use dictionaries but interpreters follow people and they translate from one language to another for two people who don&#39;t speak the same common language.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so you&#39;re a translator?</p><p><strong>Deanne: </strong>Interpreter.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Interpreter. I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> It&#39;s OK.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so you&#39;re an interpreter.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and what languages are you an interpreter for?</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> I do English and French and Italian.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> And you can do any combination? You can do English to Italian and Italian to French, <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">et cetera</span></span>?</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> Yes. Yes.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow, that&#39;s pretty amazing.</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> Yes, I love languages.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> What language are you most comfortable with?</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> I&#39;m most comfortable with English but also French because I grew up in a French province so I&#39;ve always had French in my education, so English, yeah, more comfortable with English but French is pretty much there too.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and how do you become an interpreter?</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> How do you become? Well, you have to study. Well, first you have to learn the languages. <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">It helps if you&#39;re native</span></span>.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, but like, assuming that somebody already is bilingual. They&#39;re really good at languages.</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> OK, well you study it. You can do a certificate. You have to find a, for example in your university, at a nearby university or a particular translator-interpreter school, they have programs where you can study. I don&#39;t - the one I took was about three years. Sometimes you can even do a degree in <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">Hispanic Studies</span></span> if you want to become a Spanish interpreter. You don&#39;t necessarily need the title immediately but if you have the abilities and the complete knowledge, the vocabulary you can. You can. People will hire you. You don&#39;t necessarily need the qualification depending on where you&#39;re applying for a job. It depends.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, cool.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> And you know, what&#39;s the best thing about being an interpreter?</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> Well, the fact that you meet different types of people. And you know what everybody&#39;s talking about. You never feel left out because you&#39;re the one who has to transfer the information. And interpreter is a really fun job because sometimes <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">you escort people</span></span> to fun places like to parties, to restaurants, train stations. You can be a tour guide. I&#39;ve done that too. You can do lots of really fun things and just because you speak the languages which they don&#39;t so it&#39;s really fun and you eat good food cause they pay for that, so.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Sounds cool.</p><p><strong>Deanne:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s real fun.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Wendi:</strong> At my station there&#39;s a lot of weirdoes. Have you noticed?</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>There is a lot of weirdoes in the train station.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> There&#39;s a lot of weirdoes at my station.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, why do you think that? Do you think that they just like the train station or it&#39;s this area?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> I don&#39;t know. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> I don&#39;t know either. But I&#39;ve lived all over Japan and I noticed that this train station is kind of.<br /><br /><strong>Wendi:</strong> Quite strange?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Quite weird. Yeah, like the one guy that amazes me, is the really, really dirty guy.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Super dirty guy.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> The dirtiest of the dirty.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, the guy that&#39;s got the long hair and it hangs down and you can&#39;t see his face and he&#39;s like <a href=""/NotesAudio0651/655-2-caked-in-dirt.mp3"">caked in dirt</a>, like if that guy took a shower it would hurt.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> I wonder how, and he&#39;s old.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> You know what would be amazing if we put him on Swan. On the Swan.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> What&#39;s Swan?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Swan is like this incredible makeover show where they like <a href=""/NotesAudio0651/655-3-Slice-and-dice.mp3"">slice and dice</a> people.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Sort of like change his hair and give him like...</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Yeah and like they give people like new jaws. They like just cut them up like serious. It&#39;s like extreme plastic surgery, like...</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Is this a Canadian show?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> It&#39;s an American show of course.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Really. I&#39;ve been overseas. I don&#39;t know American shows.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Yeah, any ways. The swan basically like, they hang out and they find really unattractive people and they slice and dice them into like pageant queens.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, wow.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> It&#39;s really foul. But anyway&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, actually that&#39;s</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> They could turn him into a beauty.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, maybe he doesn&#39;t want to.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> It&#39;s actually really twisted this show, like it&#39;s, like I&#39;ve seen shots of it kind of thing, but it&#39;s actually incredibly disturbing. Like that people would be willing to fully like, slice and dice, like they kind of do like this inventory. They do like a 360 of the person, like they show then in like their bras and panty of something. I don&#39;t really know.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>And they like, they just do this thing down the side, like,We are going to take out all of her teeth and you know, crack her jaw in five places and reduce her nose and open up her eyes and take off the left limb and whatever you know, they just like go down this list. It&#39;s just unbelievable and then they actually do it.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow!</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Yeah and then they end up with these people that look like drastically different but that have gone through like crazy, like, I don&#39;t know, six month-eight month surgeries and everything else to get there kind of thing. It&#39;s crazy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite color?</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Me?</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah. You&#39;re the only one here.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Good point. Favorite color -- green.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah. Why green?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> I don&#39;t know. I just chose on really. I don&#39;t know. These days I kind of like green, but it changes all the time.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Like seasonally? You have your favorite color for the season?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> I think it&#39;s more of a monthly thing.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> You?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, purple. I love the color purple.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Why is that?</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>I don&#39;t know really. Same thing I guess and I never where purple. I mean, I don&#39;t have purple clothes. I don&#39;t have anything purple in my room, but.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> You should have a purple suit.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> A zoot suit. A purple suit.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Yeah, just for one on those days when you&#39;re feeling it. <a href=""/NotesAudio0651/652-You-can-pull-it-off.mp3"">You could pull it off</a>.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> A yellow shirt maybe and purple tie.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> No, and a purple shirt too and a purple tie, some purple patent shoes and a purple brief case.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s going to go with <a href=""/NotesAudio0651/652-Complexion.mp3"">my complexion</a>.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> No, I think it will work.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Purple hat, suede hat.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>I see it all right now. It looks good.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, what&#39;s a color you don&#39;t like?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> A color I don&#39;t like. I&#39;ll show you a color I don&#39;t like, but I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a name for it, the closest name would probably be mustard.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Like this green.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>You think that&#39;s a green. See I think that&#39;s more of baby diarrhea<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> It does actually look like <a href=""/NotesAudio0651/652-Diarrhea.mp3"">baby diarrhea</a>.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> It is quite baby diarrhea. Have you ever had to change a baby&#39;s diaper?</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Of course.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Yeah, it&#39;s kind of, it&#39;s about that color and that&#39;s one that I don&#39;t like. Yeah, it&#39;s bad isn&#39;t it.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> That is disgusting.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> There&#39;s a story behind those pants.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, yeah, what&#39;s the story behind the pants?</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>I think no one would buy them so they got heavily discounted and so I purchased them and then when I got home, I was like, Wait a second! I know why no one else would buy those cause they&#39;re so ugly.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> What, you were working at a clothing store?</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> No, I was shopping.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>And you noticed that no one buying these <a href=""/NotesAudio0651/652-Poor.mp3"">poor pants</a> and you&#39;re like, &#39;I must buy them.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> Yeah. No, actually, I think like whenever I buy stuff, cause it&#39;s not often, my first thing is I look at the price tag and I was like, Ah, dam, a thousand yen, I could use some work pants. And then I bought them and well, they&#39;ve never been worn, but a little while later.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, you&#39;ve actually never worn these things?</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>I&#39;ve never worn them.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Come on, you gotta, you know<a href=""/NotesAudio0651/652-Bust-out.mp3""> bust out</a>.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> I can&#39;t bust out. It&#39;s like me busting out in those is akin to you busting out in the purple suit. It&#39;s just not going to happen.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, but you see, I would actually have to spend a lot of money. I would wear the purple suit but I just don&#39;t want to go buy it. If I actually had it I&#39;d probably wear it.</p><p><strong>Wendi</strong>: That&#39;s dishonest because if I got you a purple suit, you would not wear it.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, buy it. I&#39;ll wear it.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>Oh, now way. There&#39;s not way you would.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Because you know what, the greatest thing about being a teacher is you can wear whatever you want.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> That&#39;s kind of true.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> You know because they expect you to have no fashion sense anyway.</p><p><strong>Wendi:</strong> For sure.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> So.</p><p><strong>Wendi: </strong>It is true actually.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, Keiko, maybe you can help me. I teach at university. My students are university students and they are so <span class=""audionotes"">devoted</span> to their <span class=""audionotes"">circle</span>, their clubs. Why? Why are they so - ? To them, it&#39;s more important than class.</p><p><strong>Keiko: </strong>Well, I think it&#39;s because, in a way they have been like a prisoner, you know, a prisoner of, you know, the <span class=""audionotes"">cram schols</span>. They couldn&#39;t have much social life until they get into university, and finally they have this freedom after they got into university and now is there, actually, the first and the last chance to have fun with their friends because after four years they have to start working, and before the school years and university, they have to study everyday, so I think they are trying to get the most out of their school years.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, when you were at university, was your circle or club more important to you than your actual studies?</p><p><strong>Keiko:</strong> No, actually, I was a bit different, cause I always heard about how Japanese students don&#39;t study hard in university, so I said to myself, OK, I won&#39;t be like that.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, wow, that&#39;s very admirable.</p><p><strong>Keiko:</strong> But then, I did, I was one of the university <span class=""audionotes"">organizers</span>, university festival organizers. I was a member of that. I had done that for two years but also I tried to study as much as I could, which you know, by getting the teaching certificate from primary schools and did my thesis, my graduation thesis. It was very strange because a lot of my friends told me their graduation <span class=""audionotes"">thesis</span> was about 20 pages long and they just finished it in two weeks.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>Man!</p><p><strong>Keiko:</strong> And my professor didn&#39;t let us, allow us to do that so we had to spend two years on the research. We had to write at least a hundred pages so I learned quite a lot from that program and I was glad that I could balance out my university life between fun and study.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>One thing that shocked me at university is that a lot of times kids sleep in class, or they read books. They don&#39;t even listen to the professor and the professor doesn&#39;t look upset.</p><p><strong>Keiko:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s true.</p><p></p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Why? Like, how come the professor doesn&#39;t get mad?</p><p><strong>Keiko:</strong>I think they understand what the students have come through. I mean, I think it depends on the professors. For example, my professor was quite strict but a lot of the professors don&#39;t care because <span class=""audionotes"">they know what they&#39;ve gone through</span>. They know their situation when they came to university. Ah, yeah, let them have fun. And if they can still pass the class as long as their in the class, they don&#39;t have to do much work and even for the exams they can just pass around the notes, and somebody who ever took the notes, studied in the last two days, and they can just pass the class, so.</p><p><strong>Keiko: </strong>I guess that&#39;s a good way to look at it. I guess that they still have to be responsible for the work at the end.</p><p></p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Tim: </strong> So, Jeff, you asked me about what kind of job I&#39;d like. Well, what about a job you definitely you wouldn&#39;t want to do. There&#39;s lots of jobs out there and some of them aren&#39;t so good, so what would you not want to do?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>That&#39;s a difficult question. <span class=""style13"">I don&#39;t like working period</span>, really.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong><span class=""style13"">Yeah, but who does</span>?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Yes, that&#39;s right, but I think a type of job I wouldn&#39;t like to do would be an office job, a straight desk job, where it is just task work, where you get paper - maybe sort of like an accountant - where you are doing nothing but sitting at your desk sort of by yourself all day, <span class=""audionotes"">crunching numbers</span> or putting things into the computer. I think it&#39;s very <span class=""audionotes"">anti-social</span>, a little bit boring, not so healthy, and even if the pay was good, I still wouldn&#39;t want to do it because you&#39;re <span class=""style13"">compromising your life</span>, which is short, to something that&#39;s not so fun so maybe a desk job, something at a desk, I wouldn&#39;t like to do. How about you? What job would you not like to do?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Well, to be honest with you I don&#39;t think I would make a very good police officer. I really wouldn&#39;t want to be a police officer. I know it&#39;s exciting and it&#39;s always different but I kind of feel like I would be <span class=""audionotes"">judging people</span> and I&#39;m not anti-police. I think they&#39;re needed but sometimes I don&#39;t agree with everything that a government believes in and I think it would be difficult for me to be <span class=""audionotes"">busting people</span> for somethings that I don&#39;t agree with. And I think that, you know, it&#39;s a hard job. It&#39;s a hard job and you&#39;ve got to deal with with people that you know need help in different ways, and a police officer is just coming and putting them in jail.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> Another thing, sort of related to police officer is I wouldn&#39;t want to be a nurse or a doctor.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong> Oh, I&#39;m surprised.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> A great job and it would be rewarding to save people&#39;s lives or to make them better if they&#39;re sick, to make them healthy again, but I hate blood.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Oh, really.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I can&#39;t stand blood so if there is... I can&#39;t even stand somebody with a bloody nose so I think in a situation where there is any blood around<br /><span class=""audionotes"">I wouldn&#39;t be your man</span>.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Well, I think another job I wouldn&#39;t want to be is a garbage man, to be honest with you.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Oh, a garbage man would be great.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>I understand. Like, I like the idea of driving from house to house. I think I would be a great post office worker, and I don&#39;t mind the <span class=""audionotes"">manual labor</span> of just lifting stuff up and stuff.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> A bit smelly though.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yeah. That&#39;s the biggest thing. I think the smell would really get to me, like kind of like you were with blood. I think that eventually that smell would sometimes make me sick, and you&#39;d be surprised what people people throw away. I mean, needles, all kids of things, dirty diapers. Things like that. I don&#39;t think I could deal with that very well.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>OK, so you&#39;ll never be a garbage man and I&#39;ll never be a nurse.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Ah, fair enough I suppose.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Tim, I&#39;m a teacher, but you can have many, many jobs in the world. If you could pick any job, what do you think would be a cool job?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Well, to be honest, I think it would be pretty cool to be a fisherman.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Fisherman!</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yeah. Believe it or not I really like the ocean. I like spending time in the ocean and I think if you go out on those boats and get away from the land, you really <span class=""audionotes"">get in touch with the sea</span> and I just think that you get to work with your hands.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Is it dangerous though?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Oh, it is dangerous. For sure. <span class=""audionotes"">You can hook yourself</span>. You can get caught in storms. It can be not so good.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> Do you get paid a lot of money?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Not so much, but that is not necessarily so important. You know. You can work with nature. You can catch your own food. Provide for yourself and I think that&#39;s really rewarding. How about you? What do you think would be a cool job?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I think I would like to be a writer.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong> Why is that?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Because a movie star would be good, or a rock star but there is too much fame. Too many people always want to talk to you or want your autograph, but I think a writer, you are doing something you love without all that pressure or media coming after you and you can sort of <span class=""audionotes"">make your own time</span> and do it where you like. You can write in the country in a cabin or you can write in the city anywhere you like so I think it is a very flexible rewarding job.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yeah, you got to have the skill for it though. Do you think you have that skill?</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>No, I&#39;m a terrible writer, but if I could have my pick of jobs, I&#39;d like to be a writer. How about you? You would like to be a fisherman. Any other jobs you would like to be?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Another job that I think might be cool is a fireman to tell you the truth. Again, you kind of working with nature. I&#39;d really like to be a sort of <span class=""audionotes"">a slash and burn fireman</span>. Someone that goes out where there&#39;s wildfires, things like that, cause you&#39;re working with nature.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Those guys, the slash-and-burn fireman, they get to jump out of helicopters sometimes.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Some of them do yeah, but that&#39;s kind of the glamorous one. Yeah, I wouldn&#39;t mind just being the guy that&#39;s on the ground, and the nice thing about it is you work really, really hard and you get paid pretty well for the time you work but then you get a long time off.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>But, I&#39;m a little bit scared of fires. You don&#39;t mind fire?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>I don&#39;t mind fire so much. You know. It&#39;s hot and it can be really, really dangerous but I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s kind of exciting and I like the idea of being out there in nature and just working hard to survive and working in a team. I think it would be good.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I want to be an astronaut. I think an astronaut would be good.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Why is that? It&#39;s a dangerous job. A fireman&#39;s dangerous but it sounds like and astronaut would be pretty dangerous as well.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>A little dangerous but I&#39;d like to go to the moon to see what&#39;s on the moon. I think it would be kind of neat to be on the moon and looking back at the earth. They call the earth the blue planet. I think <span class=""audionotes"">it would be neat</span> to sit up there and look back on the earth and it would be kind of neat I think.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Sounds like you like the ocean. You should think about being a fisherman.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>No way! No thanks.</p><p></p>"
"                  <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So, Tim, you live in a nice natural spot. </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong> Yeah, that's true. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Lots of nature around where you live? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yeah, I'm from Oregon. There's lots of nature. There's not a lot of towns really. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>And do you take advantage of it by doing any outdoor sports or activities or anything? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong> Yeah, I try to, like me and my friends, we go hiking. We camp. We backpack. Snow camp. Snowshoe. All kinds of stuff. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Really. You snow camp? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong> Yeah, we snow camped before, yeah. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So do you stay out or do you stay in a cabin or? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong> No, usually we go out. A lot of times it's snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. We go out and we build <span class=""audionotes"">a little hut</span> basically by digging down and go underneath and stay there for the night and come out. It's really cold. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So, do you pull a sled behind you or do you carry your stuff? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>Usually, we just put a pack on your back. Yeah. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I want to try that. </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yeah, it's a lot of fun, but it's cold and usually you don't enjoy a lot of it until you done, and when you're done you think, Ah, that was a great experience. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong> Yeah, yeah. I think it would be good but, so is it very different from summer camping? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong> I think that the biggest thing is that when you go out there it's really, really silent. You don't see a lot of thing out and about because it's cold. So it's just really quiet and it's really, really peaceful. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong> Is it safe? Can you die? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yeah, it is <span class=""audionotes"">relatively safe</span>. People do die doing it. For the most part it's really safe. One time we were caught in a pretty bad storm and we were coming back. The biggest thing is we came out and our car was covered in snow and we couldn't get out so that was a pretty <span class=""audionotes"">big deal</span>. Luckily the cellphone worked though and we were able to eventually get out but we had to dig the car out and call come people to come out and help us. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So do you follow a trail? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>Sometimes. It just depends. Sometimes we just use navigation systems and just go out and go and pick points and go for it and sometimes we follow like ski trails that have like little diamonds on trees and you can point towards them and look for them and find them. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So do you recommend winter camping to people? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>Not unless you've had some outdoor experience. Not somebody who's just gonna go out there because you really got to look at the weather. You gotta have the right gear. If you don't have the right gear you'll <span class=""audionotes"">freeze to death</span>. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong> So city people, don't winter camp. </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong> Mostly yeah. I'd say city people better not winter camp, unless you've got somebody who's really experienced with you. I've taken my girlfriend out there and so you can do it as long as you're with somebody that knows what they are doing and you have the right gear cause if you don't have something that's waterproof and things that are going to keep water out you can't do it. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Great. </p>           <p><br />           </p>               "
"                  <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So where are you from? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>I'm from Oregon. It's right above California. It's on the West Coast of America. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So the State of Oregon. </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>It's on the West Coast between California and Washington. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So you're neighbor states, say California in the south, do you guys <span class=""audionotes"">get along</span>? Are you <span class=""audionotes"">good neighbors</span>? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>Well, we get along a little bit with Northern California. They have similar thinking. But Souther California, they kind of have <span class=""audionotes"">different thinking</span>. They think a bit more about money. And also, they are moving a lot up into Oregon, and they have different thinking and they are moving into Oregon and they are kind of changing things. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong> So do you get a lot.... are you patriotic towards your own state of Oregon? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong> A little bit. We just like to <span class=""audionotes"">keep things</span> the way they are just a little bit. Californians move up because they can sell their homes in California for a lot of money. They move up there and then they tend to be more conservative. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong> So, if I was to meet you and call you a Californian, would you get mad at me? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>I wouldn't get mad at you, no. I would think that he must think I was from Northern California. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So do the Californians feel the same way about the people from Oregon? Is that a mutual emotion to dislike the Oregon people as well? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>I don't think so because there's been a lot of them moving up. You know they <span class=""audionotes"">move up there to retire</span> and they move their kids up there, so I think they life Oregon and Oregonians tend to be pretty friendly. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong> And how about the North, your northern neighbor? Washington? </p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong> Washington and Oregon are pretty similar as far a culturally. </p>           <p><strong>Jeff: </strong> So if I call you a Washington - if I say your are from Washington you don't mind as much as being called Californian? </p>           <p><strong></strong></p>           <p><strong>Tim: </strong>Ah, that's true. Yeah, that's for sure. </p>           <p><br />           </p>               "
"<p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So where are you from?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>I&#39;m from Oregon.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Oregon.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong> Yeah. It&#39;s on the West Coast of America, above California and below Washington. It has the coast. It has the mountains and a lot of different regions really.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Really, so which is your favorite of those for regions, which do you like the best?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Well, that&#39;s difficult. I like the coast a lot. The coast of Oregon is really, really rocky. It&#39;s really natural. In Washington it&#39;s really, <span class=""audionotes"">really developed</span> and in California as well, but in Oregon it&#39;s really, really natural - really rocky. There&#39;s beaches and you go out there and it&#39;s just nature.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Swimming? Fishing?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>It&#39;s cold so there&#39;s not a lot of swimming. There&#39;s surfing. There&#39;s really good fishing. People fish. They take boats out. It&#39;s really nice, but...</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> Sounds good. So you have the ocean and then you can move inland to the woods.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yeah, from the ocean you move inland and you&#39;ve got a real green area. In fact, in gets some of the most rain in all of America really.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> So it is a rain forest.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Well, there are areas that are considered a rain forest. One of the biggest rain forests in America is there, but it&#39;s real wet, real green and really <span class=""audionotes"">mossy</span>. There&#39;s moss hanging off the trees. It&#39;s beautiful. The greenest place you&#39;ve ever seen.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>And then, so you had the beach, the ocean. You had the woodland. Is there any other types of regions or landscapes?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong> Well, you got the real green area I talked about and then from there you go to the mountains, and the mountain kind of <span class=""audionotes"">traps all the rain</span>. On the other side, it&#39;s really dry. It&#39;s called kind of a dessert region. Lots of cattle ranchers. Real dry. It gets snow. It&#39;s good for outdoor sports, but hardly any rain really.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>And that is mostly, you say farmland?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yes. It&#39;s farmland. Ranching land.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> Are there any cowboys?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>There&#39;s lots of cowboys, actually. Lots of cowboys. Lots of people think of Oregon as a real <span class=""audionotes"">liberal area</span> but on the other side of the mountains it&#39;s <span class=""audionotes"">real conservative</span>. So really two types of people.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So, you have those three regions. Do you have any big cities?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>We have Portland Oregon. It&#39;s a pretty big city. It&#39;s got a basketball team. It is a real nice city. It&#39;s got good public transportation.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> So would you like to live in Portland?</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong> I&#39;d like to live in Portland. It&#39;s be OK, but there&#39;s two college towns that I think would be really good: Corvalis, Oregon and Eugene, Oregon. Real liberal college towns. They&#39;ve got really good places to eat and friendly people. A little more liberal and laid-back, so it&#39;s my type of place.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong> So that sounds like a pretty good place to live. It has a little bit of everything.</p><p><strong>Tim: </strong>Yeah, I think so.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Maybe I&#39;ll move there.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, now Matt, you used to work in Hollywood as an actor. Can you talk about what kind of actor you were?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Sure. I acted mainly in <span class=""audionotes"">commercial work</span> and that is I <span class=""audionotes"">auditioned</span> for commercials and basically in Los Angeles it&#39;s unlike any other city in the world for acting and it&#39;s just so heavily centered around Hollywood and television and screen work that there isn&#39;t really a lot of work in theater so I didn&#39;t have a <span class=""audionotes"">ton of training</span> going in to the acting world when I entered L.A. so like many others I opted just for commercial work and tried to get experience that way.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, cool. So how do you actually <span class=""audionotes"">get a gig</span>? Tell me about the process.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong> It actually... It&#39;s a lot more complicated than I thought when I first got there and competitive. Basically, there are two types of actors in Los Angeles. There&#39;s <span class=""audionotes"">union actors and non-union</span>. And to really progress you need to be a union actor which takes getting a speaking part or doing commercial work, which took me about six months and from there becoming a SAG member, screen actor&#39;s guild member. You&#39;re in the union which looks a lot better on your resume to go after agents so that was my next step and after I got an agent then I was able to be sent out on auditions and look for work that way.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> So how did you get your first big break?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong> It was just by chance really. I was acting and I was doing a lot of non-speaking work on television and movies and really not progressing as fast as I wanted to and I was on a commercial for I think it was Pepsi and they liked my look and they needed an extra guy in the scene in a library and they put me in and from that thirty second spot which was shown all the East Coast of the United States I has half of my income for my first year because you get royalty checks every time a commercial is shown on television. You get paid, so...</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Nice.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Yeah... But from there I went back to television and movies.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Cool.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, Matt, we&#39;re talking about acting and you were an extra. Can you talk a little about what an extra is and your experience?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong> Sure. Extra work is basically background in any scene for whatever reason. Obviously, movies and television, they need to be <span class=""audionotes"">authentic looking</span> so they obviously, in restaurants or in places of public business, they need extras to walk behind the main actors or be set behind the main actors to set the scene, so there is tons of work in Los Angeles and New York for those types of jobs and obviously they are paid a lot less but people do survive doing that and use it as a way to <span class=""audionotes"">springboard their career</span> and meet people and <span class=""audionotes"">network</span> and make contacts while they are on the set because extra work is mainly about waiting and you are on the set for long periods of time, from twelve to sixteen hours doing <span class=""audionotes"">virtually nothing</span> but waiting for the set to be ready for you to go out do your twenty second saying and then go off the set and wait until they reposition the cameras, so it&#39;s a very... it&#39;s quite boring and so you need to have something else to do while you are waiting and a lot of people in Los Angeles use that to meet people.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Well, so how did you get started? How did you get onto a movie set?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>I was in San Diego living at the time and I had just quit my job in real estate and was taking acting classes in San Diego, and actually the guy who taught my classes also was a <span class=""audionotes"">pseudo-agent</span> or knew people who did a lot of film work in San Diego and so I was able to get work in San Diego for a couple of months and then from there found out about the extra work and was intrigued and obviously, naturally I was looking towards Los Angeles just because that is where you need to go to get work if want to do that for a career.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK. Thanks Matt.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, Matt, I thought we would talk about people that we admire and the qualities about them that we admire. So, first we&#39;re both sports fans. Who is an athlete that you admire?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Athlete that I admire? I would have to say Jackie Robinson, would come to mind, just because <span class=""audionotes"">the barriers he had to overcome</span> and the things that he experienced, that people after him...</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, can you... a lot of people might not know who Jackie Robinson is.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Oh, sure, yeah, I&#39;m sorry. Jackie Robinson was the first black man, the first man <span class=""style4""><span class=""audionotes"">to break the quote-unquote color barrier</span></span> in baseball and he was in 1947 brought in to the Major Leagues from the Negro Leagues which were at that time the only place where blacks or colored athletes were allowed to play baseball, so the first three years <span class=""audionotes"">he endured an enormous amount of racism</span> and hatred and he had to basically <span class=""audionotes"">bite his lip</span> and wasn&#39;t able to seek revenge or fight for three years, so yeah, just what he went through, above and beyond just playing the game was something that I always admired in him.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Yeah, a special guy. Definitely. How about in movies is there an actor that you admire?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>You know, I mean, I love so many actors and actresses in different roles. I think just in the interviews that I&#39;ve seen, I really like Johnny Depp because he can play different characters and he&#39;s not afraid to play off the wall characters or even bit parts or small roles that other main actors probably would not be interested in and he definitely, he brings humor to every dramatic role that he does. And just being in LA, I had a chance to see him film the movie Blow for about a week and just to see his demeanor on and off the set and he was not superficial or tough to deal with at all just from an outside perspective, he seemed like a really <span class=""audionotes"">down-to-earth</span>, cool guy, so I&#39;ve always admired him.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Well, what is your favorite Johnny Depp movie?</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong> I&#39;d have to say, well, the first Pirate, Pirate&#39;s of the Caribbean Movie, the first one was fantastic, his role in that, and yeah, that&#39;s probably my favorite.</p><p></p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong> Keren, you have talked about places you have been. Now. why don&#39;t you talk about places you want to go. Where would you like to visit?</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> Whoa! There are so many places. I&#39;d love to go to Cuba.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Why Cuba?</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> I imagine it&#39;s such a <span class=""audionotes"">unique place</span> and it probably won&#39;t be so unique for much longer, and I&#39;d love to see what life is like there.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Right. So about Cuba, <span class=""audionotes"">what is it that attracts you</span> about Cuba? I take it, it&#39;s not baseball.</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> No! Well, part of the reason is that I can speak Spanish, so I love to practice speaking it, and it has beautiful beaches but it also has cultural history also. So there&#39;s lots to do there.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, now, I think you actually have travel plans <span class=""audionotes"">coming up</span>. Aren&#39;t you going somewhere soon?</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> I am. Yes. I&#39;m going to Cambodia.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, Cambodia.</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> What are you going to do in Cambodia?</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> I am going to go to to Angor Wat to see the <span class=""audionotes"">old temple ruins</span> and then I&#39;m going to go to Phnom Pen and after that I&#39;m going to the beach.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Nice. So, the beaches are popular now in Cambodia?</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> Yeah. I believe there are lot quieter than the beaches in Thailand but they are becoming more popular and they&#39;re <span class=""audionotes"">supposed to be beautiful. </span></p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Now is this the first time you&#39;ve been to Cambodia?</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> Yes it is, yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, OK. So are you going straight to Cambodia or are you going through Thailand?</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> I&#39;m gonna fly to Bangkok and go through Bangkok to the Cambodian border.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK. How long do you plan to stay?</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> About ten days.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Ten days. Well, I hope you have a nice trip.</p><p><strong>Keren: </strong> Thank you very much.</p><p></p>"
"                  <p align=""justify""><strong>Adrienne: </strong>So, what's your favorite thing to do in the winter? </p>           <p align=""justify""><strong>Lisa: </strong> My favorite thing to do in the winter is probably to go skiing. As I said before, forty-five minutes from Montreal is a great ski resort called St. Sauveur. You go up there for the day, dressed warmly of course. Probably you leave your house around seven-thirty in the morning. Get up there by eight-thirty. Go skiing all day. And while you are going skiing you take breaks to go into the lodge where you get hot chocolate or poutine. So, many people don't know what poutine is. Let me explain. Poutine is french fries with cheese and gravy all mixed together so when it's cold outside and you're dying for something warm and maybe carb-heavy because you're doing so much exercise skiing, I allow myself a little poutine treat where I go into the lodge and, you know, get my poutine. Many people don't like it. Many people think it's kind of strange. Normally those people are people who aren't born in Quebec or aren't Canadian, but once you acquire the taste for poutine it's difficult not to order it. </p>           <p align=""justify""><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Well, I really like sweets in the winter when I'm cold. For some reason I crave sweets, so is there anything that I would like to eat in the winter? </p>           <p align=""justify""><strong>Lisa: </strong> Yes! Because of the French influence in Montreal there are great crepes so another popular thing to do for apres-ski, which is <em>after skiing</em>, is to go to a creperie where you get a big bowl of french onion soup dripping with cheese and for desert you'll have a crepe, you know, with chocolate in it or bananas. There is something to satisfy all tastes. </p>           <p align=""justify""><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Sounds fantastic. </p>           <p align=""justify""><strong>Lisa: </strong>It's wonderful. </p>           <p></p>               "
"                  <p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> So tell me about how Rocky is a survivor. </p>           <p><strong>Lisa: </strong> So, Rocky is a survivor, for two reasons. One because of her surviving in the bushes, but... and that was only when she was really only a month old and we took her in. But she really earned her name last year, when she was about a year old, Rocky liked going out on my balcony, and I used to let her go out on my balcony with out a leash or without supervision and she decided that she wanted to see what was beyond the balcony, so she climbed up to the top of the balcony which was like a concrete wall and she jumped. When I, you know five minutes after I had noticed that she has jumped, I went looking for her all around my apartment building. This was probably at eleven o'clock at night, and I couldn't find her anywhere, so I thought she had jumped to the roof next to my apartment building and she was out hanging around with other cats. I was very worried, but it was dark and I couldn't find her so I went to sleep. I woke up the next morning at five o'clock, a very worried mother looking for my cat, and I noticed that she had fallen actually between my apartment building and the roof, the apartment building next to mine and wasn't moving, so I picked her up and I brought her to the hospital and it turned out that she had actually broken her pelvis bone, which means that she could move her two front paws but she could not move her back paws, so she basically couldn't walk at all. </p>           <p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Oh, my goodness. </p> "
"                  <p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> Hey, Lisa, I was hoping you could tell me a little about this cat? </p>           <p><strong>Lisa: </strong> This is my cat Rocky. Her name... her full name is Rocky Parker, and the reason for that is because she is a survivor and I'll go into that, how she's a survivor soon, and also because she climbs the walls like Peter Parker, Spiderman. How we found Rocky, was that our friends of ours lived in this apartment complex. They were walking home one day and they heard this cat <span class=""audionotes"">meowing</span> in the bushes and they stopped and looked for it. They kept on hearing it meowing but they couldn't actually see where it was. So they started looking for it and it happened that there was a police officer who was in the <span class=""audionotes"">general vicinity</span> and came to help them look for the cat. So they finally found this little kitten who was not more than a month old, had obviously been abandoned by her mother and the police officer explained that because of the animal laws in the community that if they didn't take the cat in or find an owner within a week, they had to bring the cat back to the SPCA, they couldn't leave it out on the street again. </p>           <p><strong>Adrienne: </strong> What's the SPCA? </p>           <p><strong>Lisa: </strong> The SPCA is the Society for the Protection of Animals and that controls... it regulates stray animals. It also is a place where you can bring dogs or cats and they are given away free to owners, to new pet owners. </p> "
"                  <p><strong>Todd: </strong> So, Phil, we both live and work in Japan. We're both teachers in Japan. Now are you homesick. Are there things that you really miss about England? </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> The thing I miss the most, and it's going to sound really sad, is my cat. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, that's cute. </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> Yeah, I love my cat. I don't know why. I'm a bit sappy like that, so I really miss my cat. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, well talk about your cat. What's your cat like? </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> My cat is black, very fat, very stupid like most cats but very lazy like me so we have a lot in common but just she likes to wake me up at six o'clock in the morning and I really curse her and hate her. Still, I can't be angry about it. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> Yeah, right. </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> And sometimes she'll bring a bird in, and she thinks she's having a great present by brining us a bird and my mom gets really angry and... </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> Ooh! Wow! You're cats still primitive. It still goes out and kills birds. </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> Oh, yeah, yeah, and occasionally mice because we live in the country so there's a lot of animals nearby and my cat will always try and catch them. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, cool... So what's your cats name? </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> Chaz. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> Chaz? </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> Yeah. We got her from a charity called the Cat's Protection League in England. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, I'm sorry. What's that? Can you explain? </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> The Cat's Protection League is basically, there's a lot of homeless cats in England. People abandon them because they can't look after them or whatever reason and they will take them in and they will give them food and try to find them new homes and we found our cat from there. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> So you saved Chaz? </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> Kind of, yeah. I think we saved him. Maybe or maybe we condemned him. I'm not sure. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> So, what's cool about your cat, Chaz? I mean, why do you have this bond with your cat? </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> I don't know. Maybe we're on the same level. We both like to spend our weekends sleeping all day and doing as little as possible, eating a sleeping so maybe we're just on the same level, but I'm not really sure. We're just both as stupid as each other I think. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> So, you would say you're definitely a cat person and not a dog person? </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> Yeah, yeah. I like dogs but I think cats are actually more intelligent on a... like if you throw a stick for a dog, the dog will always fetch it. The cat will look at it and fetch your own stick you idiot. </p>           <p><strong>Todd: </strong> That's true. That's true. Well, anyway, hopefully you'll be able to see Chaz soon. </p>           <p><strong>Phil: </strong> Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. I hope so. </p>           <p></p> "
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong> So, Barbara, we&#39;re talking about your time in the hospital. You were in the hospital for sometime. First of all, how long were you actually in the hospital?</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> Well, I was in two hospitals actually. At first, I was in a big hospital for three and a half weeks and I was on a drip for all of that time, and they didn&#39;t let me eat anything, and the first couple of days, they also didn&#39;t let me drink anything.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Whoa!</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> So you were on a drip&hellip; I&#39;m sorry, how long?</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> Three and a half weeks.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Whoa! No solid food for three and a half weeks.</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> No food for three and a half weeks.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Man!</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> Yeah, I was dreaming about my mother&#39;s cooking, and I was dreaming about roast chicken and roast lamb and man, the smells and the tastes came back to me, but there was no food.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> But after like, say two weeks or something, does your body just get used to not having food?</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> Yeah. Yes, it does. Definitely. And I lost a lot of weight, but actually I felt fine. Friends who came to visit me in the hospital were surprised and they were like, &ldquo;Wow! Where&#39;s the rest of you?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> You did lose a lot of weight. Actually, how much weight did you lose?</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> I lost, well, I started losing weight because I was changing my diet just before I got ill. In the last eighteen months, I&#39;ve lost twenty kilos.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Whoa! That&#39;s a lot.</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> That is, indeed, yeah.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Twenty kilos&hellip; Wow! Well, you look great. You must feel great.</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> I feel much better. Actually I think sick with that was probably a good thing. It made me take stock and reevaluate things and get healthy.</p>"
"<p><strong>Todd: </strong> Now, Barbara, it&#39;s really good to see you. I heard that you were in the hospital.</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> Yes, I was. I got sick in august last year and luckily I was with my students and the lady was a nurse. She and her husband drove me to the hospital. I was doubled over. I was clutching my stomach. I had so much pain, a burning sensation in my chest. I didn&#39;t know what was happening. They took me to the hospital and they did some tests and they said, &ldquo; Well, you have gallstones.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Gallstones. What exactly are gallstones?</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> Well, next to your stomach, there is an organ called the gallbladder and the job of this organ is to hold some liquid which comes out of your liver and this liquid stays in your gallbladder and is saved for when it&#39; needed, and when you eat something that contains fat or oil, the bile from the gallbladder is squirted out and goes into, perhaps your stomach or your intestine. I&#39;m not sure which, and there it does something to help you to cope with the oil. Perhaps it binds with the oil or makes it easier for your body to get rid of it &ndash; to eliminate it.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> OK, so when you have these gallstones, do they give you medicine? Do they remove them through surgery?</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> There are a couple of different things to do. My gallbladder was working too hard because I was eating an unhealthy diet and not exercising enough, so inside my gallbladder, there were too big hard stones. Some people can have surgery to remove them. Some people have laser surgery, where the doctors aim a laser at the stones and shatter them, but the small pieces are still there and they have to be passed out of the body naturally and that is still a problem. With me, my gallbladder was inflamed and they looked at it and said, &ldquo;No, it has to come out&rdquo; so they took out the whole thing: the gallbladder and the two stones inside it. So now I have no gallbladder, so if I eat oily food&hellip; well I have no gallbladder to contain the bile from my liver which I need to process the oil.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Right, right.</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> So, if I eat anything with oil I feel sick, and I usually&hellip; yeah, it&#39;s not good. So, I avoid oil, which is healthier anyway.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Well, I&#39;m just glad that you&#39;re OK. That sound pretty awful.</p><p><strong>Barbara: </strong> Oh, well, I&#39;m fit now. Yeah, everything&#39;s OK.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong> Oh, good to hear.</p>"
"                  <strong>Fred: </strong>Hi, Sabriya. So tell me, in Oman do you guys have the same culture, the same traditions as we do? Do you celebrate New Year's?     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> Yes, we do. It's not one of the big events known in Oman but we do celebrate New Year and we follow the same calendar <span class=""audionotes"">as you guys</span> do.</p>          <p><strong>Fred: </strong>Oh, is that right? So, as New Year's is almost coming soon, do you have any New Year's Resolution?</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> Well, for the past maybe three or four years I've been trying to have different <span class=""audionotes"">resolutions</span> but I never manage to <span class=""audionotes"">stick to them</span> or keep them. However, this year, I think I've <span class=""audionotes"">made my mind</span> up on a resolution which I plan to keep and that is to limit or actually lessen my phone bill. </p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Lessen your phone bill. Wow. I can't imagine how big the phone bill was before if you want to change it.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya: </strong>Oh, my goodness it was so big. I mean, you know, you know how much I love talking on the phone so, yes, it was quite big and I intend to, you know, discipline myself a lot more. So what about you Fred?</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> What about my New Year's Resolution?</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Wow! My New Year's resolution... I would say more my New Year's resolutions. I have many, but I think I have to focus on one or two of them to make it happen, so number one, I think as many people out there, I would like to quit smoking.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya: </strong>Good for you.</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>Thank you very much.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya: </strong>Good for you.</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>Will you support me?</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> Definitely. No doubt about it. I will personally support you. </p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Thank you very much for all your support. I think it's  gonna be very good for me. Not only because this is bad for my health, but you know, it's just something that I think will give me a lot of confidence if I'm able to to do this, to quit. I will say I am strong and confident in myself and I can do this. Now, my other New Year's resolution would be... I love my grandmother so much, but as I don't live close to her anymore, I feel that I'm <span class=""audionotes"">losing a bit</span> in my relationship with her, and so I would like to call her every week.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> That is very sweet. That is so cute. I think that's something we should all have. </p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya: </strong>To have grandmothers and mothers and call them all the time.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Fred:</strong> Hi, Sabriya. This is almost the end of the year, so tell me, how was your year 2007?     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> My year was quite interesting. I learned a lot. I've experienced a lot.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> You've experienced a lot. What have you experienced?</p>          <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> I've tried new things. Things that I have not done before. I've tried different jobs.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> What kind of jobs have you tried?</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> I've tried working with children, actually, this year and it's been amazing. It's just been <span class=""audionotes"">the best experience ever</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> What was it exactly that you did when you were working with children?</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya: </strong>Basically, it was in a... it's not <span class=""audionotes"">a rehabilitation center</span>, but it was a center for disabled children, and basically what we do is we spend the day with them and attend classes with them and just play with them, talk to them, interact with them during the day.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Wow, that's really great. So you did some <span class=""audionotes"">voluntary activities</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya: </strong>Yes. Yes. I did for the first time.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Wow, that's really cool.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> <span class=""style6"">It was quite an experience</span> because I was quite scared at first. I wasn't to sure how to treat them. <span class=""style6"">I wasn't to sure</span> what exactly I should do, but the instructors were very nice and they explained that, you know, you just have to <span class=""audionotes"">be yourself</span> and treat them like any other children, and that's how they want to be treated - just like normal children, and that's what I tried my best to do.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Wow, so you must have learned so much, and you became a more responsible, <span class=""style6"">mature adult</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya: </strong>Yes, it did. It changed me in that terms because I become more patient than before. Before, I mean, <span class=""style6"">I used to be quite stubborn</span> and I used to irrationally make decisions, but after this I calmed down and <span class=""audionotes"">I always questioned myself</span> before doing something, so I think in that way I completely changed.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Could you say that what you've learned through your experiences of working with children has also helped you in other parts of your life?</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya: </strong>I think the whole getting <span class=""style6"">a patient side</span> has helped me in many terms because it's made me think for example, when I want study or when I want to take classes, I always ask myself, should I do this? Should I  do that? Should I go here? So, I don't think like that, so it's just a matter of thinking ten times before I decide anything.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> OK, well you know I feel that I can learn a lot from you and maybe I should do the same thing to become a more responsible person, too.</p>     <p><strong>Sabriya:</strong> You should. I'd advise you to. Working with disabled children is nothing like anything else. It's amazing. You should. You should.</p>               "

Are you going to visit your family?     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Well, Anja, the routine in Canada for Christmas is quite simple. The kids get very excited on the 25th because early in the morning, at around seven o'clock, that's when we open the gifts.</p>          <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Oh, you <span class=""audionotes"">open the gifts</span> in the morning?</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> That's right.</p>     <p><strong>Anja: </strong>Oh, wow.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> At around seven o'clock in the morning, we... well, as I kid I remember being so <span class=""audionotes"">unbelievably</span> excited, so at night, I don't think I could sleep. I was too excited about waking up early in the morning and then opening my gifts. So what we do is that the parents put the gifts under the Christmas tree, and then early on the 25th, in the morning we all gather around the Christmas tree and then, <span class=""audionotes"">one-by-one</span>, we open the gifts.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> So you open the gifts in your <span class=""audionotes"">pajamas</span>, and then you...</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> That's right. But that's not the most exciting part of the day.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Oh, it's not? What is then?</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> No, the food is.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> The food.</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>The food is the most exciting part of the day. Well, in Canada we eat lots of, as you may know, we have maple syrup.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Oh, yes, that's right. You are really famous for that, right?</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> For maple syrup. Maple syrup is something that Canadian people love eating during the Christmas holidays and so all of the time through the week of the 25th until New Year's Eve, the first of January, we cook many kind of different dishes and we just put maple syrup on it.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Oh, really. For instance, what do you eat? Is there some traditional food you have for Christmas in Canada?</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>Of course. We have traditional food. As you may know, pancakes.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Of course.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Anja: </strong>I love my <span class=""audionotes"">pancakes</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>You do, you do, yeah. Yeah, I love pancakes, too. We put maple syrup on it. Oh, it's so good, you know, and you know what else is really good?</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> What is?</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>We fry pig's ears.</p>     <p><strong>Anja: </strong>Oh my god, you do?</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yeah, it's delicious, and the tongue of the pig as well. We fry it. And then we put maple syrup on it.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Oh, wow, I didn't know that. That's quite interesting.</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>Yeah, it's delicious. You should try it one day.</p>     <p><strong>Anja: </strong>Oh, I will definitely.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Fred:</strong> Anja, so <span class=""audionotes"">what's it like</span> to decorate your Christmas tree in Switzerland? <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Ah, Christmas tree! Oh, that's so nice, right? Like, I remember in my family, you know, we have the special, like space in our house just for the Christmas tree, just for Christmas time.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> A special space for the Christmas tree!</p>          <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Yes, indeed! And I remember I always went with my parents to buy the Christmas tree, maybe, three days before Christmas.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> OK, three days before.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Yes, and we wouldn't put it actually until Christmas day, like I remember how me and my mother and the rest of my family, we went to church and then we would come back. My father wouldn't go to church and the door would be closed and then we open the door and suddenly there would be the Christmas tree. So actually, you know, like, I never knew that my father actually put the Christmas tree. Of course, it was like some angel or <span class=""audionotes"">something like that</span>, but actually I never decorated the Christmas tree because an angel was doing that for us... as in my father.</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>So when you were a young child, you always thought that some kind of angel would come down to your house and decorate your Christmas tree.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> That's right. During the time I was in church, and did it for us. And it's really pretty, and it has a lot of lights and it's really colorful. You know some people like it one specific color: in red or blue, but our Christmas tree always had  a lot of different colors. It's really nice. What about you? How is your Christmas tree like in your family?</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Ah, it's just great. It's a bit different because the whole family would gather and then <span class=""audionotes"">put up</span> the Christmas tree together.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Oh, really?</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>We would decorate the Christmas tree together.</p>     <p><strong>Anja: </strong>Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>Maybe too or three days before Christmas, we would all go to the store or just use what we already had and then we would all gather together and put up the Christmas tree together listening to Frank Sinatra's best Christmas songs, and actually, the size of the Christmas tree was the most interesting part.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Oh, is it? Is it really big or...</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>It was a really, really big Christmas tree, and my father used to love those big Christmas trees and then it would <span class=""audionotes"">take so much time</span> to decorate it. Think about a fifteen foot Christmas tree, <span class=""audionotes"">how much time</span> you have to spend to decorate it.</p>     <p><strong>Anja:</strong> Oh, wow that's a tall tree.</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>Yeah, but it's a lot of fun. </p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Mini, your country, Sri Lanka, is a very popular tourist destination. Can you talk a little about costs? Like how much does it cost to have a nice vacation in Sri Lanka?     <p><strong>Mini: </strong>It's a very cheap place to have a vacation, so for example if you have... your budget is around 50,000 yen <span class=""audionotes"">in terms of</span> rupees around 45,000 rupees, you can have a good vacation. You can have a good hotel. You can have good food. You can shop as well - by clothes and <span class=""audionotes"">all the stuff</span> and go around the country as well.</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's pretty cool. So, how much is a nice hotel, like a five-star hotel?</p>     <p><strong>Mini: </strong>For one day, it's around 10,000 yen. Around 9,500 rupees. </p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Right. So 10,000 yen. OK, so that's pretty cheap. That's about 100 dollars I think. Right? One hundred U.S. dollars? So, a five-star hotel, you're talking about beautiful room, nice swimming pool, <span class=""audionotes"">nice facilities</span>, everything.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> Everything is there, and it's near the beach <span class=""audionotes"">as well</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, man, that's great. So, what if you want something cheaper. What if you just want a small room, very basic, just a bed, a bathroom, no swimming pool, nothing nice. How much would a hotel like that cost?</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> OK, for that, you can pay around a thousand yen. Around nine hundred rupees.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> A thousand yen.</p>     <p><strong>Mini: </strong>A thousand yen. A thousand, five hundred yen.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Ten dollars.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> Mm-hm. That's cheap.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>For one night?</p>     <p><strong>Mini: </strong>Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Really.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> Mm-hm.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I wanna go.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> I'm sure.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That is really, really cheap.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> Yeah, it's very cheap.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, what about things like internet access? So can you get high-speed internet access?</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> If you want to stay in a hotel like that, no, you can't get internet access from those kind of hotels, but if you stay in four-star hotel, maybe three-star hotel you can get high-speed internet access.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> But you have like centers, internet media centers, kind of stuff. You can pay like fifty rupees and access to the internet. You can do it anytime.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. OK. And just lastly, what about meals? How much do meals cost?</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> If you want to go for a nice <span class=""audionotes"">buffet</span>, maybe around two thousand yen, a thousand, five hundred rupees around.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, that's actually kind of expensive, isn't it. Two thousand yen.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> But you have everything there. It's really nice. I love it.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. Well, it sounds like a great place to go. Thanks Mini.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> You're welcome.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Hello, Mini.     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> Hello.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, Mini, you are from Sri Lanka.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> If somebody is going to your country, can you recommend three things they should do or three things they should see?</p>          <p><strong>Mini:</strong> OK, the first thing is you can go and see the ancient things that all the Kings and Queens built, like castles. We have <span class=""audionotes"">a castle</span> called... it's called the Rock Castle. It's called Sigirya, so it's very beautiful.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> This is the Rock Castle.</p>     <p><strong>Mini: </strong>Yeah, it's... <span class=""audionotes"">the castle</span> is on the rock itself, so you can see the ruins there. It's really beautiful, with pictures, paintings, arts and stuff.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really. That's really cool, so this rock castle, how old is it?</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> I'm not sure, but maybe around two thousand. I'm not sure. Sorry.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> What else should people you see?</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> The second thing should be beaches. We have beautiful beaches <span class=""audionotes"">all over the place</span>, blue, clean. You can swim. You can surf. It's very beautiful. That's the second thing.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Surfing is popular in Sri Lanka?</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> M-hm. I mean, not popular <span class=""audionotes"">amongst</span> Sri Lankans but most of the... many tourists come, especially the Germans, they come to my country and surf because the hotels near the beaches are very cheap and it's very beautiful hotels and very cheap. Food is cheap. It's nice.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. So, we've got the Rock Castle, surfing on the beach. Anything else? </p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> And then a third thing should be the Tooth Temple. It's like the tooth of a Buddha, so we got it from I guess India, King Ashoka, so it's one of the things that you can see there. It's a really beautiful temple.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, I'm sorry. Can you say the name of that again?</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> Temple of Tooth Relic.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> The Temple of Tooth Relic.</p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. </p>     <p><strong>Mini:</strong> It's in Kandy. A place called Kandy.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Kandy. OK. Well, thanks for the tips Mini.</p>               "
"<strong>Todd:</strong> So, Fred and Katia, we&#39;re talking about your dance school. Can you talk a little about your dance background? How did you learn how to dance?<p><strong>Fred:</strong> Well, for myself, I can say that being Canadian, <span class=""audionotes"">it&#39;s not in my blood or anything</span>... to know how to dance.</p><p><strong>Todd: </strong>The Canadian salsa.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> The Canadian salsa. Right. <span class=""audionotes"">If such a thing would exist</span>. That would be great. But in fact, yeah, for me it was quite a challenge because I didn&#39;t know so much about salsa when I first started dancing when I was maybe 14 years old, where I got interested, and so I started to take some lessons in Canada and then I started dancing a bit and then I decided to do an exchange program in Spain for two years, where of course, in a latin country people dance more, those kind of dances, so I could take some lessons from a professional Argentinian tango teacher which taught me a lot about listening to the music, the rhythm and everything like that, so I really got into it so since then, since I&#39;m 14 years old, so it&#39;s been close to 8, 9 years now that I&#39;ve been dancing South American dances.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> That&#39;s <span class=""audionotes"">a pretty good background</span>.</p><p><strong>Katia:</strong> It&#39;s very good, and you can tell right away. You put on the music, the latin music on and there goes Fred dancing.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">I just can&#39;t stop myself</span>. I really enjoy it. It&#39;s fun.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> The pride of Canada.... Katia, how about yourself?</p><p><strong>Katia: </strong>OK, my background. Well, I&#39;m half Mexican, half Russian so I do have the latin blood and European or Russian blood, and I started dancing when I was very young. My mother was a ballet teacher, so that&#39;s where I took it from.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> So you started out in the ballet?</p><p><strong>Katia:</strong> Yes, classical ballet. Classical ballet, that was my first type of dance, and after that, of course, I mostly grew up in Mexico, so there was a lot of salsa and merengue always around so I grew up with both classical ballet and latin dance and then of course I started to learning a little bit more about different dances. I like belly dance and also ballroom dance, or sports dance, which includes cha-cha, and waltz, and fox-trot, a little bit of tango, which I was not very successful, unfortunately, at least yet.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> You can&#39;t be successful at everything, so.</p><p><strong>Katia:</strong> Why not? No, but after I&#39;ve been teaching for many years, since I was 17 years old, I was teaching in Mexico and then I moved to the United States. I was also teaching there, classical ballet, and now here. I also held a few dancing jobs. I worked in a circus, dancing.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">Get out of here</span>. You worked in a circus?</p><p><strong>Katia:</strong> I worked in a circus, and I also worked in Las Vegas with... as a back.. in the back of the stage. There&#39;s an impersonator, for example Janet Jackson or Micheal Jackson, or Elvis Presley, and I was one of the back dancers.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow, you guys are the perfect team.</p><p><strong>Katia:</strong> We... I think, we are the perfect team.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yeah, I think, we are a pretty good match but I really do think that Katia is a great teacher as well as being a good dancer.</p><p><strong>Katia:</strong> But, I do believe that many of our female dancers, when they come to salsa, they see Fred and they really feel motivated to see somebody that is not Latin and being able to dance how he does, so I think Fred inspires a lot of people.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, yeah, for anybody out there that are interested, this school is in Beppu which is in Kyuushuu Japan and I wish you the best of luck.</p><p><strong>Fred:</strong> Thank you so much.</p><p><strong>Katia:</strong> Thank you.</p>"
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Katia and Fred, we're talking about your dance school, and before we were talking about the belly dance, and Katia you do the belly dance, but you also do Salsa.     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> That's right, Todd. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> And that takes two?</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> That takes two. <span class=""style6"">It takes two to salsa</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> It takes two to salsa. So you are part of the salsa team?</p>          <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yes. If we could call it  a team, I mean, </p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> It's mostly Katia teaching me how to dance and then I try to <span class=""audionotes"">pass it on</span>to the others.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> That's not true. Fred... Fred is a very good teacher, I think he's just very humble but where I think we make a very good team: We're both patient and we know what a student is struggling and that's the important part.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> And it's also good to have partners like this to teach other people, whether they're partners or not, or they just want to learn salsa, like the men would come to me to learn about  a special move and then the women would <span class=""audionotes"">have a tendency</span> of going more towards Katia so we're making... <span class=""audionotes"">striking a perfect balance</span> in teaching, I think.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, do you get a fair balance of students, of male to female students, for salsa class?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Right now, we have more women than men so hopefully we'll have a balance in there, but yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> I guess women are <span class=""audionotes"">more open towards </span>taking dance lessons than men are. Maybe men feel a bit scared. I don't know. How do you feel, Todd? Would you come to the school?</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, you know what, I will. I will come, but I have to admit my feeling would be that I would be intimidated. That I would look really foolish, so yeah. I think most guys would probably feel the same way.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yeah, that's why we have more girls I think.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Unfortunately, but the truth is from what I've heard from the guys, from the men, they do want  to learn how to dance.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, it does sound fun. It does.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> And women also like it. Women like for the men to dance, and especially in Salsa, usually it's the man is the leader,so it's very important that the man is who leads.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That sounds like more pressure.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> No, no, no. Well, you learn how to be a good leader and how to lead, and the woman how to follow.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, let's say somebody goes to your school, like myself and they have <span class=""audionotes"">two left feet</span>. They cannot dance. How long does it take to where you can do a salsa reasonably well?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> We... right from the beginning, at least we can a little bit, where the person is and does it, can they hear the music or not. From the first class, you dance with a partner. Of course not freely. We can tell you what steps to take. And we advance accordingly, so it might take in one step, it might take a long time, so it depends on people that are in the class, and it all depends on the person.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. So some people learn faster than others.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> But definitely after one class, you will have learned a minimum two steps</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. Really.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Guaranteed. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I'm sold. I'll definitely come and try it out.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Please do.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Please do.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Katia and Fred, we're going to talk about your dance school.     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> OK.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, first can you explain where your dance school is and what it is?</p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>OK, Todd. Well, we have a school that's called International School of Dance, where we teach belly dance and Latin American dance, which mainly consists of Salsa, merengue, bachata, and it is located in Beppu, Japan.</p>          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, when did you think of this idea for...?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> We thought about it maybe a month, a month ago. Not long ago. Right the next day, or right away, Fred was already working on everything, so we just gave some e-mails, were doing this, and what about this, and so everything he started right away and we actually had an integration for the school maybe almost three weeks ago, and since we opened the following day we already are teaching.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Already. </p>     <p><strong>Fred: </strong>So, we have something close to twenty students in three weeks of the school opening.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's pretty fast.</p>     <p><strong>Fred:</strong> Yeah. It is very, very fast.</p>     <p><strong>Katia: </strong>Yes. I think we are surprised.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, why did you choose those two dances: belly dance, right, and salsa?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> I think mainly because this is what people are interested in right now and it's something that a lot of people can learn and it's popular and of course I can teach this kind of dance so of course.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, you're saying that belly dance is popular?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Yes, it is. Yes, it is.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I had no idea.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> It's very popular, and especially around women. It's something that gives <span class=""audionotes"">a certain feeling</span> to the woman so it's of course you workout. You use your body movements, but also there's <span class=""style6"">a special feeling</span> about doing <span class=""audionotes"">belly dance</span> so it's popular.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Could you kind of explain a little bit more? Like, what do you mean it has a special feeling? Like, this dance has special... I don't know, uses special muscles or...</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> No, not exactly like that. Of course the music has to do a lot with it. When you hear a Latin music, you feel different and you move different. When you hear Oriental music, then you have completely <span class=""audionotes"">a different posture</span>and for example, as a  woman, you will tend to take a different posture. Your body will be different <span class=""audionotes"">depending on the music</span>. With belly dance, your body posture is very different, that for somehow, some reason... and maybe because of the history of belly dance, it's very <span class=""audionotes"">related to femininity</span>, being feminine and dancing.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd: </strong>So, Asako we're talking about Alaska. Now, in Alaska, obviously there's lots of wilderness. Some people say it's the most wild area left  in the word. Did you get a chance to go camping or hiking?     <p><strong>Asako: </strong>Oh, yeah. Camping almost every single weekend. <span class=""audionotes"">That's a joke</span>, but... Yeah, many times. I camped and of course people enjoy hiking, rock climbing. If you're not really <span class=""audionotes"">an outdoor type</span>, you can enjoy barbecuing, but yeah, some people do enjoy outdoor.</p>          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, you know, Alaska is really famous for bears, so when you would go hiking or camping would ever see any bears?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Of course.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Seriously?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Yeah. Of course. Wolves. Bears. <span class=""audionotes"">You can name it</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Bears. Wolves.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> And people still go out there?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Of course.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, but aren't you afraid of the bears?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Well, you have to know what you are supposed to do, but yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, what do you do?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Well, you have to be careful about what you would do with your food. You know. You don't put your <span class=""audionotes"">leftovers</span> anywhere you like. You have to be really careful with that, and also you have to know how you are supposed to act when you actually meet a bear when you are hiking, but if you have the right knowledge, you should be OK. Of course, still there are accidents  but you should be OK.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow! So what do you they tell you to do if you see a bear?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Well, you're supposed to wave your hands.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wave your hands. Up high?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Up high.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So you seem taller?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> You seem taller and also bears have never seen animals doing stuff like that, so they get scared and leave. That's usually  but when bears are really hungry, then you still, yeah, so there are bears that are really hungry and maybe look crazy, so you're still <span class=""audionotes"">taking a chance</span>, but.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, what about a wolf? Or wolves? Do you do the same thing for wolves?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Well, actually, the only wolves I've seen was in the Denaly Park. I was in a car, so i didn't have any problems, so I really don't know what I am supposed to do when I meet wolves.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Now for the local people, what do they consider more dangerous, a wolf or a bear?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> You don't see many wolves, but you do see a lot of bears so maybe bears.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, yeah. Well, they both sound scary to me.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Asako, we are talking about your time in Alaska. Now you are from a major city in Japan, correct?     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> That's right. Nagoya.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Now, Nagoya is a very big city.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Very big. Two million people.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, what was it like going from a big city in Japan to <span class=""audionotes"">way out in the wilderness</span> in Alaska?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Do you know what? A lot of people think I had problems, many problems,  but actually I did not. I just loved it. I did not have any problems.</p>          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So maybe, <span class=""audionotes"">by nature</span>, you are actually more of a nature person.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Exactly. So when... actually when I had problems, was when I came back to Japan, back to the big city in Nagoya. Then I had a lot of problems.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>You missed the wilderness?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> I missed silence. Quiet. I... just too many, too many sounds in the city. Even when you're sitting in your room, you still hear some sort of sounds, noise, surrounded by some sort of noise all the time, and <span class=""audionotes"">I just couldn't stand it.</span> It took me a long time to get used to.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>You know that's kind of interesting because I grew up in a small town and then I moved and I lived some major cities: London, you know, Tokyo, and I lived in Bangkok and when I would come home from being in Bangkok, Thailand, I was so used to having people around all the time, it was really hard to have too much space.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Interesting.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> It was too much, like <span class=""audionotes"">I missed having action and noise</span> around me all the time.</p>     <p><strong>Asako: </strong>So you are a city person?</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>You know, it's funny, <span class=""audionotes"">oddly enough</span>, I grew up on a farm and in a small town and I actually think, Yes, I am more of a city person.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Wow.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Maybe it us just the difference.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Maybe so. Maybe. Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So would you like to move back to Alaska some day?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> I would love to. It could be a little difficult because it's very cold in the winter. But I would love to. I miss nature.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Now do you do the really rough, Alaskan things, like hunting, fishing, things like that?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> I have tried. I couldn't catch any.... well, fish yes, but I couldn't shoot anything, but I tried.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You tried to shoot?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Shoot. I  did.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>You didn't hit anything?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> I didn't.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Really!</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> I was really bad.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, I am sure, out there, there's some animal that's very thankful you're not good at hunting.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> I'm sure they were.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd: </strong>So, Asako, you lived in the United States for a  long time.     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> For six years.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That's <span class=""audionotes"">a pretty long time</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Asako: </strong>That's right.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Where did you live?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> I lived in Alaska.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Alaska.</p>          <p><strong>Asako: </strong>That's right. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">The last frontier</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> I'm an unusual one.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, yeah, cause usually when people go and live in America for a long time, they don't choose Alaska.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Yeah, that's right,  but Alaska is such a beautiful state.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Why did you choose Alaska?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Well, I went to university there. There was a university. I wanted to go. That is the reason.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>And then you stayed  for six years.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">I fell in love</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Wow!</p>     <p><strong>Asako: </strong>Just beautiful. That's it. Just beautiful.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So what do you remember most about Alaska?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Wilderness. Mountains. Glaciers. Mosquitos.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Mosquitos?<br />       <br />       <strong>Asako:</strong> Mosquitos. <span class=""audionotes"">Big ones</span>. Really big. You can't see such a big mosquito anywhere else on this island, not on any other place,  but huge mosquitos. <span class=""audionotes"">Some people say</span> mosquitos are actually the state birds of Alaska.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>The state bird. Really. So obviously there's lots of beautiful things and the mosquitos, but what else? Like what was the city like? I mean, was it a big city or a small city?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Well, the biggest city is called Anchorage, and... but it's not really big-big. In the middle... the biggest street in Anchorage you can see moose. </p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>You can see moose?</p>     <p><strong>Asako: </strong>Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Just walking around.</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Walking around. Exactly.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>In the city there's moose?</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> Yes. Exactly.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now can you go up and pet them like....</p>     <p><strong>Asako:</strong> No, never. Never. They are wild things. You can't pet them, but, I mean, they are very, very calm and nice animals but if you meet a mother moose and if there are children, her children are around, they can be really mean. So you don't really pet them. You can look at them and admire them, but that's it. Beautiful things.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, that's good to know.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Anita:</strong> Well, Todd, since you've asked me about San Francisco, tell me, have you ever been to Prague?     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I have been to Prague. Actually, I lived in Prague for about a week, or two weeks. </p>     <p><strong>Anita: </strong>OK.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> A long time ago.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Wow.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">Right out of</span> college.</p>          <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Really. And how did you like it?</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, it was great. It was one of the first European cities I went to, and it was so different from America, and I thought the architecture downtown was really beautiful.</p>     <p><strong>Anita: </strong>So what was your <span class=""audionotes"">first impression</span> when you got there?</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, when I first got there, I had no place to stay, and this young kid <span class=""audionotes"">came up to</span> me and convinced me to live in his house.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Wow!</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So they... his mother was renting rooms to foreigners, so I lived with a Czech family for about ten days.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Really, so did you eat Czech food?</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I did, but you know I don't remember anything about it. It was so long ago. It seemed really good though.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> I guess. I like it. So what did you do in Prague? What did you see there?</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, of course I went to the downtown area which had the castle and the bridge and lots of the old buildings, and I just took <span class=""audionotes"">local transportation</span>. I took the... I guess it's not a subway or...</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> It is. You can call it a subway. We call it the Metro.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, I took the Metro to different places and I took buses and just walked around the city and I had a good time.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Did you find it cheap or expensive compared to the States?</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, it was really cheap, but at that time I was working in Europe and I had no money, so I still was very poor.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Hmm, I see.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, so now... I was in Prague, you know, 12 years ago. Do you think the city changed a lot since I was there?</p>     <p><strong>Anita: </strong>It's changed very much. I guess since the fall of Communism in 1989, the city started changing at that time and it's still changing. It's become very modern. Of course the historical parts are still preserved. You're not allowed to build skyscrapers or very tall buildings. It's good because after the fall of Communism a lot of the buildings were renovated, so the whole city looks like it's new. It's old new.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah. </p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> It's very colorful. It's just beautiful. Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, I remember, the city almost looked like a museum because the buildings were just so <span class=""audionotes"">pristine and perfect</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Anita: </strong>Yeah. It's... I personally just love walking through the streets. You can never get tired of that.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, hopefully I can go back again someday.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Anita, have you been to San Francisco?     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> I have been there once a long time ago when I... well, not that long but when I was twelve years old I went there with my family.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Great. You know, I'm from San Francisco so what did you think?</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> I think it was a very beautiful city. You had... there's so many nice houses in these little <span class=""audionotes"">winding streets</span>, you know, going up the hills and down the hills, and you get the old, the historical <span class=""audionotes"">trams</span>.</p>          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Right, exactly.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Right?</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> The cable cars.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> The cable cars, and the Golden Gate Bridge is beautiful of course.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, actually I think the Bridge is still <span class=""audionotes"">pretty amazing</span>. I mean, even people that live there, it's just an amazing thing to look at, to cross. It's nice. But one thing about my city is it's really expensive. Did you <span class=""audionotes"">find</span> it expensive when you were there? </p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Well, thankfully I went there as a child so my parents paid for everything, so I didn't have to worry about that so...</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> If I went there now, I mean, probably I would be worried about that, yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, I think... I'm sorry. I forgot. You said you were twelve.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, OK. Well, when you were in America did you enjoy American food?</p>     <p><strong>Anita: </strong>Yeah. I like any kind of food, so... I don't like to eat too much fast food but I didn't have any problems now that I recall, now that I remember so... It was OK.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. Yeah, but in America we don't eat that much fast food, at least not in San Francisco.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> OK, I'll take your word for it.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Did you talk to anybody, or did you meet people?</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> In San Francisco, not that I remember. Of course, we talked to people we met but we didn't visit friends. We just went there as tourists and you know, took <span class=""audionotes"">a couple of</span> tours, so yeah we talked the tour guide who lives there, and it was nice meeting somebody from San Francisco.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, my favorite part of the city is... there's two places actually:  Golden Gate Park and also the Presidio. The Presidio is also a park. Did you go to either of those?</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> I think we did. I don't remember them very clearly but all the major sites that are there we definitely went to. It's hard to miss.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd: </strong>Hello, I'm here with Anita. Anita, where are you from?     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> I am from the Czech Republic.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, and what city?</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Ah, from the capitol city, Prague.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, that's a beautiful city.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Yes, it is. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Can you talk a little bit about your city?</p>          <p><strong>Anita: </strong>OK, Prague is a very <span class=""audionotes"">historical</span> city. It's got many, many old buildings. It's very popular among foreign tourists, especially. The <span class=""audionotes"">main attraction</span> is the Prague Castle, which is right in the city center. That's where the President has his office.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Inside the castle?</p>     <p><strong>Anita: </strong>Yeah, in the castle.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's really cool.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Yes, yeah, it's really beautiful. Of course you can't go into his offices, but you can go into the premises of the castle and walk around and there's a very big cathedral right in the middle of the castle and it's absolutely gorgeous.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, actually, I saw the castle many years ago, about 12 years ago, and if memory serves it was built by the Romans? Or am I wrong?</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> I'm not very good in history, so I'm sorry.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, I...</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> I'm not sure.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I'm probably very wrong.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> But, one of our late last kings. He was an emperor of Rome as well.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I see.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> A Roman Emperor.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, so maybe that's it.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Something to do with Rome. Anyway.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Somebody will probably write me now and tell me the history. And there's also a really famous bridge correct?</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> The Charles Bridge. Exactly.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> The Charles Bridge.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, it must be nice to be living in a city with so many beautiful buildings and history.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> It is. You know, I mean, of course it depends where in the city you go because the city center is the historical part but when you go to the <span class=""audionotes"">outskirts</span> of the city, that's  where it is... that's where you get buildings from the <span class=""audionotes"">Communist era</span>, so it's not colorful. It's all grey. It's all one style and it can get pretty ugly in some parts, but if you stick to the city center it's gorgeous. It's like a fairy tale.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So would you say then that your city is <span class=""audionotes"">a mix of</span> new and old?</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Um, I probably wouldn't say a mix of new and old because they're not mixed in one place.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> It's old in the center and then new, not modern... I wouldn't say modern, but new, Communist new in the outskirts, so it's separated. It's not mixed together, which is good because when tourists come they don't get to see the ugly parts as much.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> It's like in the States. Believe me, every city has it's ugly parts.</p>     <p><strong>Anita:</strong> Yeah, I guess.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Before musicians like you said used to wear ripped jeans. Jeans with big holes or rips in them.     <p><strong>Mariel: </strong>Oh, yeah, that was <span class=""audionotes"">in the 80's</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, maybe that was my generation. So that's not popular anymore?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Some people like to wear ripped jeans, yeah, still, but mainly the rips are quite neat, so they're usually ripped a little bit around the pockets or <span class=""audionotes"">around the cuffs</span>, you know the bottoms,  Yeah</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, yeah. That sounds like designer jeans. Maybe then like.... are they specifically made just for that style?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Well, yeah. Actually, quite often the jeans you buy in the store are already ripped or already worn so they look like they're old but they are <span class=""audionotes"">brand new</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> But designer jeans can be really expensive, right?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Oh, they can be very expensive but people are willing to pay the money because they're designer jeans. They're cool.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, how much do you pay for jeans?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> I can pay up to 120 Euros for jeans. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> A hundred and twenty Euros.</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yeah. </p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That's a lot of money.</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> It's a lot of money, yeah, especially because I'm a student but I'm willing to <span class=""audionotes"">put the money into it</span> if the jeans fit very well.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Just, lastly about jeans, these days there's many different colors. You have the light blue jeans, or the darker blue jeans. Which colors do you like to wear?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> That depends on the time of the year actually. In the summer I like to wear light blue jeans and then in the winter I sometimes wear black jeans or really dark blue jeans.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, that's interesting. So you change the color by season?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yeah, generally I think I wear more darker clothes in the winter.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, just off hand, how many jeans do you think you have? How many pairs do you have at home?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> I think I have about <span class=""audionotes"">eight or nine pairs</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's a lot.</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> That's a lot but actually, I use only two pairs of them.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Your favorites?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yeah, my favorite jeans. And they're baggy.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, thanks Mariel.</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> You're welcome. My pleasure.</p>               "

Yes, I am.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> What city are you from?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> I live in a city called Espoo, which is right next to Helsinki, but I was born in the center of Finland in a place called Jyvaskyla.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right in the middle?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel: </strong>Yeah, <span class=""audionotes"">pretty much</span> right in the middle.</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So is that way out in nature in the forest, or is it a big city?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> It's a <span class=""audionotes"">reasonable size</span> city, maybe the fifth largest in Finland, but it is very, a very natural place still. It's surrounded by lakes and forests and lots of cliffs and really beautiful scenery. Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, that sounds nice.</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I love it there. I go back there every year to visit my hometown.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now does your family still live in your hometown?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel</strong>: No, they live down south near Helsinki.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, is that common? Everybody moves to the big city.</p>     <p><strong>Mariel: </strong>Pretty much, yeah. Especially young people. They want to get jobs and go to schools near Helsinki. Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now is Finland part of the European Union?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yes, it is since 1995.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so because it's part of the European Union do a lot of young people decide to leave Finland and go live in other countries?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> The Finnish young people are actually very outgoing and they're very interested foreign cultures so a lot of people take a year or two just to travel, just to see the world, visit some places, and yeah, a lot of people go out to other countries to study as well. <span class=""audionotes"">Yep</span>, mainly Europe but also a lot of my friends for example went to India for six months or to South America.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. Sounds fun.</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> But because you're in the European Union you can go live in France or Germany or Spain if you want, correct?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yeah. It's very easy. Just go.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> But do most Finnish people prefer to stay in Finland or do a lot of people like to go move to warmer climates?</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Finnish people are very <span class=""audionotes"">patriotic</span>. We really love our country. We like to visit other places but I think even if we live abroad for a long time most people always some back to Finland. I think especially if they want to have a family because Finland is a very safe place and it's very good to <span class=""audionotes"">raise your kids</span> in Finland.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Sounds like a nice place.</p>     <p><strong>Mariel:</strong> Yeah, I think so. You should come and visit.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I'd love to.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Paul:</strong> Hi, this is Paul from England speaking with Katia from Mexico. Today we are speaking about friends and money. Katia, if a friend came to you asking to borrow some money, what would your reaction be?     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> If I have a good friend that really needs the money then, of course, if I have the money, I would probably lend it.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> So, in what situation would you lend your friend money?</p>     <p><strong>Katia: </strong>Well, for example, it's a person that is really trying their best to have money and it's in a  situation that it's an emergency and needs the money then I would lend it. What about you Paul?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Yeah, I would lend... I would be a little bit nervous to lend a close friend money because I think that money can sometimes <span class=""audionotes"">affect a friendship</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> I guess that's true. Do you have <span class=""audionotes"">a bad experience</span> with it?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Actually, I do. Yeah. I've had a bad experience of <span class=""audionotes"">a very close friend of mine</span>. He was asking for money from me and at first just once and then twice and then he started asking for more money and it actually had <span class=""audionotes"">a big effect on our friendship</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Are you still friends?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Oh, we're not. We're not friends anymore, but he did buy his car.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Oh, wow! This was for a car.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Yeah, he kind of cheated me out of a lot of money, so he was working as well and he was trying to save some money and<span class=""audionotes""> <span class=""audionotes"">in the end</a></span> he bought his car but he lost his friend. </p>     <p><strong>Katia: </strong>Yeah, I guess that's very difficult to say, but what about... would you ask for money if you need it?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Personally, I think before I asked a friend for money I would prefer to either ask my parents or my sister. How about you if you were in that situation?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, if I had no choice, and not asked my family, I could ask my friend. Of course, he has to be a very good friend and for a very good reason for me to ask for money.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> So could you lend me some money, cause I'd like to go to Hawaii next week?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, Paul let me think about that one.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> OK. Thank you.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Paul:</strong> Hi, this is Paul from England and I'm here with Katia from Mexico. Today we're gonna speak about being a woman. <span class=""audionotes""><a href=""#content"">I can't imagine</a></span>what it's like to be a woman. It must be really difficult.     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, I wouldn't say <span class=""audionotes"">difficult, difficult</span>. I think it's great, but it comes with some difficult things I guess. Maybe I can think of make-up and it takes us so long to get ready and it's something that we really need to do, so maybe that's one thing that we have to get used to it.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Come on. It can't be so difficult: make-up. Putting on make-up on every day.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, you get used to it, but just imagine, we need to look for the right colors, the right brand, the right price. It really <span class=""audionotes"">gets tough</span>.<br />       <br />       <strong>Paul:</strong> Sounds tough. Anything else difficult about being a woman?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, some people say that it might not be so difficult but maybe giving birth might be something that woman have to face that is difficult, but perhaps for some women it's not so difficult but I think that's one other thing.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Yeah, for sure. I'll never know about that. How about good things, positive things about being a women?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, there are many positive things. I actually can say I'm happy being a woman. Maybe one thing is, well we have in a sense... we're able to choose if we... once we marry, if we go to work or not, in general. I think that's one good thing. Don't you agree?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Yeah, I would agree with that. For sure. Anything else that's positive for you?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, since I'm not married yet, going on dates I think it's great the man has to pay. So that's a positive thing of being a woman.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Great. Yeah. I definitely agree with that. OK, and finally is there one last thing. What's your favorite thing about being a woman?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> My favorite thing? Maybe having a<span class=""audionotes""> sixth sense</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Could you tell me more?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, as a woman we sense certain things that men are not able to sense, so I think that's  a very positive thing.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> For example?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, for example, Paul, as a woman we sense people's feelings even though, for example, a man will not say anything. We can see, or we can feel what the person is feeling. The same with children, or the same with other women.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> I would agree with that. Women have to <span class=""audionotes"">be more sensitive</span> to these issues I think.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Yeah, sensitive. You can call it sensitive. I call it a sixth sense.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> OK, it was nice talking to you.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Thank you, Paul.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Katia: </strong>Hello, everyone, this is Katia from Mexico and we are here with Paul from England, and today we're gonna have a very interesting conversation about men. What's difficult about being a man and what are the good things about being a man, so we have the right candidate for this. Paul, what are the bad things about being a man?     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> What's difficult about being a man? Well, I think... the hardest thing I think is working. The man is <span class=""audionotes"">under a lot of pressure</span> to go to work and to earn money for the family.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> But I thought men like to work.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Yeah, men do like to work of course. Like most men want to have a career but along with the work, there's a lot of pressure. They have pressure from their wife, from their kids, from their family, from the bank manager.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Yeah, I guess so. That can be stressful. What else? What else are one of the bad thing of being a man?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Well, I guess, if a man's... has a good job or a job that's taking up a lot of his time, this can sometimes <span class=""audionotes"">lead to problems</span> with his relationship, especially with his his kids, I think. For example, if the kids are spending a lot of time with their mother, usually they <span class=""audionotes"">form a closer relationship</span> with their mom, so the father, I think, <span class=""audionotes"">misses out on</span> his kids growing up sometimes.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Yeah, that is true and now I can that clearly unfortunately it seems that it's a lot of bad things with the job, but I am sure they're very good things about being a man.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> For sure, there are a lot of advantages I think. For example, appearance. I think, for a man, he doesn't really... when he's not working, he doesn't really need to worry about his appearance. He can wear whatever clothes he wants to wear. He doesn't brush is hair or he can wear <span class=""audionotes"">scruffy shoes</span> for example.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Mmm, are you sure about that one?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Would you disagree? Yeah, I think usually that appearance is not so important for a man.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Possibly.I guess women spend more time in appearances but there must be more things than this about good things about being a man.</p>     <p><strong>Paul: </strong>Good things? I think men usually can have more fun than women. Like in their free time, they get to play sport and do a lot more fun things I think than women.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Well, Paul, I'm gonna have to disagree with that one, but tell me why. Why do you think men can have more fun than women?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Maybe I'm just thinking from a man's <span class=""audionotes"">point of view</span>, but to me shopping sounds  very boring.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> OK, well, I do agree with that one, but still you haven't answered my question.</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> What was your question again?</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> Why do you think men can have more fun than women?</p>     <p><strong>Paul:</strong> Just I think that men have a lot more freedom to do fun things and travel. For example, safety and traveling alone. A man can just go traveling by himself, where a woman, she has to think, where am I going, is it safe. For example, this kind of think.</p>     <p><strong>Katia:</strong> OK. I can understand a little bit. You were getting a little bit nervous, Paul.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Jeff:</strong> So, Jonathan, what is home for you? Where is home for you?     <p><strong>Jonathan: </strong>Where is home for me? Actually, I would have to say that I'm <span class=""audionotes"">homeless</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Homeless! What do you mean homeless?</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Well, I don't call one particular place home. I pretty much live out of a suitcase. I don't have roots holding me to one particular place. I was <span class=""audionotes"">born and raised</span> in Toronto but from a very young age I was traveling for different purposes: some for the work that I was doing, some for just pleasure travel and even now when I go back to Toronto, it doesn't really feel like home. In fact people comment about my accent, and they say, Oh, that's an interesting accent. Where you are from? and I say, Well, I'm from here.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> So where do you <span class=""audionotes"">split most of the majority of your time</span>? Where's your base?</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Well, I don't really have <span class=""audionotes"">a base</span>. That's the thing. I spend about four, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less, months in Japan and I usually visit my parents for about a month a year, sometimes in Canada where they spend spring, summer and early autumn, and sometimes in this small little town in Mexico that they like to go to avoid the harsh Canadian winter.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> So, you and... in between those times, in between Mexico, in between Canada, in between Japan, where are you?</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan: </strong>Wherever I sort of feel like going. Now I don't draw the kind of salary that allows me to live a glamourous lifestyle and travel around the world with <span class=""audionotes"">the jet set</span>, but I can certainly go and spend several months a year in different destinations, living a very basic existence but having enough time to be able to travel around and stay in <span class=""audionotes"">simple accommodation</span>, go out and hit the bars at night, talk to the people I meet in those different areas. At different times I have different interests.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> So that sounds like a pretty exciting, pretty fun life. Do you ever get tired of it?</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> I think that it's the kind of life that doesn't <span class=""audionotes"">appeal to everyone</span> and some people think I have this wonderful, fantastic life all the time. Sometimes, I would like to work a little bit more. Sometimes, I think, Oh, no! I have nothing to do for the next three months.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Except for travel.</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Yes. And as of now, this work that I'm about to do finishes in a couple of days and people have asked me, where am I going afterwards and my honest answer is I don't know. I literally have no idea where I'm going to be four or five days from now, and I have no idea what I'll be doing for the next three months until I need to be back in Japan for work three months from now.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, good luck on your next trip.</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Thank you.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Jeff:</strong> Now the world is small and there's this type of people who are called <span class=""audionotes"">backpackers</span>, and you've been a backpacker, or you are a backpacker. What's a backpacker and what do you think of them?     <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">I don't know if I'd go so far as to say</span> I'm a backpacker. I actually have a bag that rolls on wheels, so I don't know if I fit that category. When I was younger, then I certainly did go around with the backpack and considered myself to be a little bit a part of that community. I wouldn't say I really would consider myself one anymore because a lot of people that I meet who consider themselves to be backpackers, they almost have a little bit of an <span class=""audionotes"">unusual perception</span> of what they are, and they think somehow they're different from say tourists, and I meet people who say these things, like, I'm not a tourist, I'm a traveller, or I'm not a tourist, I'm a backpacker in some way suggesting that they are above being a tourist in some way, but in the same hand, I'll meet people who are in some area like say Khao San Road in Bangkok, which is famous as being a backpacker street, and I meet people who stay there for two weeks and only talk to other backpackers, and they end up at the end of their holiday saying how much they love Thailand, whereas the realty was they never really went anywhere except perhaps to a little bit to a temple or something.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So, are backpackers boys and girls, old people and young people, Indians and Canadians. Is there any, like, are all backpackers Americans for example?</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan: </strong>Oh, no, actually, I meet very few Americans when I travel surprisingly. It seems that certain nationalities have <span class=""audionotes"">a greater predisposition</span> to travel. I meet as many Canadians as I do Americans despite the population of the United States being ten times larger than that of Canada's. I meet a lot of New Zealander's, whereas their population is comparatively tiny, but they can come from any place. I've met backpackers from all kinds of different walks of life, different age groups, different nationalities, but you do find that the majority of them are young people. Perhaps they're taking a year off before or after college. Maybe they just want to see a little bit of the world before they know they're going to be rooted in one place because perhaps from their field of study they think that their future is going to be more or less planned out and they want to get a bit of travel in before they<span class=""audionotes""> <span class=""audionotes"">embark on their career</a></span>.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> So you have a wheely case, and you're not really a backpacker so is it OK if I call you a wheely-packer?</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> I suppose you could call me that, but I'm not sure whether other people would know that term, and if you don't mind, I'm not going to refer to myself as a wheely-packer.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>OK. Good luck on your next trip.</p>     <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Thank you.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Matthew:</strong> Hi, this is Matthew White.     <p><strong>MB:</strong> And this is MB.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> And we are talking about our experience with Habitat For Humanity and our trip to Papua New Guinea with a group of Japanese students.</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Right.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> MB, a lot of people ask, you know, you raise money and you give to these people and  help out by building these houses but wouldn't it be more efficient just to send the money. Why do you need to spend the money on airfare and go?</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Right. A lot of people ask me that when I tell them about my experiences and I think that going to a different country and <span class=""style5"">experiencing the culture firsthand</span> is one of the most important parts about <span class=""style6"">learning about Habitat</span> and about being a part of Habitat. I think if you just donate money to any organization you don't have the <span class=""audionotes"">firsthand experience</span> and you don't have the chance to make new friends and to learn about a culture and to have such a wonderful time and if I just were writing a check or just sending some money I wouldn't feel like I had really made a difference but by going on these trips and taking students, especially with me, I feel like I'm a part of something and I can see firsthand that I've tried to help make a change and I can see firsthand how much the students have learned from it. How do you feel about that?</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> I agree. I think that the, maybe more than the money gets donated, is the time of each individual and we all only have so much time on this earth and <span class=""audionotes"">your presence is what is appreciated</span> by other people. That's something that you can't experience, you can't feel the appreciation for what people feel when they actually get to meet you, and I think that maybe when we left at the end of the trip, and all the villagers showed up at the airport to say goodbye to us, it really showed that presence, being there is such an important part of what we do.</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong>Right. Yeah, I really agree. One thing that I always do when we go on Habitat trips is take off my watch. I don't think on these trips that you really need to worry about every minute and you don't need to worry about time because it's really important <span class=""audionotes"">to be in the moment</span> and to be a part of the experience and maybe we go for two weeks or ten days but you can't measure how much you change or how much you learn or how much you are <span class=""audionotes"">moved by the experience</span>. It's really <span class=""audionotes"">priceless</span> and a lot of times when I tell people about my experience I say I couldn't put an amount of money on how much I learned or how much I've been changed. </p>               "
"                  <strong>Matthew:</strong> So, MB, with Habitat For Humanity, can you kind of describe for us a normal day at one of the work-sites?     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Sure, so we usually get up very early in the morning, probably around 6:30 in the morning and when we were in Papua New Guinea we had to walk to the area where we were going to have breakfast so we had to walk through the village and say good morning to all the villagers and then we shared breakfast together with our team which the villagers prepared for us.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> What kind of food was that?</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> In Papua New Guinea they eat a lot of potatoes and sweet potatoes and and some fish and some noodles but mostly their staple... and also bananas. They have a lot of plants or fruits that they grow on their property we ate a lot of that and then after breakfast we usually have a <span class=""audionotes"">short orientation</span> about what kind of jobs we're going to do that day and we're usually broken down into different teams and then we work for maybe two hours and then we have a short break and then we work again until lunch time. These jobs can be anything from planing wood or cutting wood or helping to lay the floor or putting up the walls or painting the walls or anything like that. And then we have lunch with the team and also with the villagers usually and after lunch we, in the past, we usually play with the children after lunch for a little while and then we go back to work for maybe about three or four hours in the afternoon. And night-time is  cleaning up as well as having dinner again together with our team, or with the villagers. It really depends and then we usually have a meeting where all the team members get together and we have a <span class=""audionotes"">reflection time</span> about what happened that day or any problems, or we get a chance to talk to each other about the different jobs we were doing, so it's a very busy day, every day, but it's really satisfying and a lot of fun and we learn so many things, so many new things every day.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> That's great. You did mention that during the reflections, you talked about any problems that occurred. What kind of problems have occurred?</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Not so many, but in the past sometimes students get sick or they don't <span class=""audionotes"">adjust to the heat</span> of the country were in or they're not used to working physical, doing <span class=""audionotes"">physical work</span> every day or, so they're getting tired easily or something like that, or sometimes we just talk about problems in <span class=""audionotes"">adjusting to the new culture</span>. Sometimes it's very hard and very sad to see such poverty and to see people suffering but if we have a chance to share our feelings with each other it makes it easier to talk about and to think about.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Matthew: </strong>Hi, everybody. My name's Matthew White and I'm here interviewing Mary-Birch Harmon, who <span class=""audionotes"">we lovingly call</span> MB. MB, we know you go on lots of trips for Habitat For Humanity. Could you please explain exactly what is Habitat?     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Sure. Habitat For Humanity is an <span class=""audionotes"">NGO</span> that's based out of America and it's committed to stopping <span class=""audionotes"">poverty housing</span> all over the world.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> All over the world. OK, so normally do you do your work in America or where do you go?</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> I have gone on many trips in Asia actually. I'm mostly involved with Habitat For Humanity International.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> So how many trips have you been on?</p>     <p><strong>MB: </strong>I've been on six different trips.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew: </strong>OK, six trips.</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> And where did you go on the last trip?</p>     <p><strong>MB: </strong>I went to Papua New Guinea for two weeks.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> Two weeks.</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah, and I went with ten students and there were three teachers on the trip as well.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> Students! And how do you <span class=""audionotes"">convince students to go</span> on these trips?</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Well, I'm a member of a campus chapter through a university in Japan and I've been able to go on these trips with the students because they are very committed as well to stopping poverty housing and they've studied a lot about the different countries that we visit and they've studied a lot about how we can help by helping to build a house.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> You said you went to Papua New Guinea last time.</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> Can you tell us a little bit about what that experience was like?</p>     <p><strong>MB: </strong>Sure. We had a wonderful time. We were there for two weeks and we were working on a wooden house. In the previous trips we never had used wood before so this was a new experience for the students and for myself and it was lot of work. It was a lot of hard work but we were able to finish most of the house. We didn't complete everything, but we worked as hard as we could and we put a lot of love into the house and it was a lot of fun.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> So do you have... I mean, how do you... You're building a house. Do you have some special construction skills?</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> No, I don't. I'm an <span class=""audionotes"">unskilled laborer</span>, but when you go on a trip they have skilled laborers there, or skilled people there that teach you how to build, so we do very simple tasks and we try to help the local people or the family build their house.</p>     <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> When you say simple tasks, simple can different for different people. What's a simple task?</p>     <p><strong>MB:</strong> Well, like we learn how to mix cement which means that you have to mix it using the cement sand as well as water as well as rock or you learn how to plane wood which is to make it very smooth, or you learn how to hammer a piece of wood for a wall or for flooring or anything like that. Simple meaning a job that anyone could learn how to do.</p>               "

Unfortunately, I have not.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> No, really?</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>I think you need to go really far to the north.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> North. Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>Like, up around, like the North Pole maybe because I think the polar bears live like only on the ice, and this is like really far from any kind of like, you know, city or civilization, and I've never been up to like such a remote kind of place.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> OK, I see.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Unfortunately no polar bears. I've seen other bears, but no polar bears.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>OK, me either.</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>No polar bears in China?</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> I don't think so. </p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>No.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> I don't think it's cold enough to have polar bear there.</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>How about Panda? I've heard there are some Pandas in China.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>Yeah, I saw Panda for several times.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">In the wild</span> or in a zoo?</p>     <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>In the zoo.</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>Oh, OK.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>And on TV. I just joking. I just saw some pandas by myself in the zoos, but I don't think they are the, you know, how do you say, because I think in the wild we can see the Pandas. We can see their activities more.</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>Right.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">How should I put that</span>?</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> It's more natural maybe.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Natural, yeah. It's very natural, but in the, you know, in the zoos the pandas are always sleeping. They're... or they're just eating something.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Lazy animals.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> No, the cannot do some, you know, outdoor activities.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Right.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>Poor pandas.</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong><span class=""audionotes"">It's a shame</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>Yeah, it is.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Fanny: </strong>Hey, Brian, you know, recently I heard that the Canadian dollar is very strong.     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> It is. <span class=""audionotes"">It's been amazingly strong</span> in the last few months.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> What happened? I mean, <span class=""audionotes"">how come</span>?</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> It went up. The reasons behind why the Canadian dollar is strong...</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Very good question. <span class=""audionotes"">Without getting too complicated</span>, my understanding is the Canadian dollar is linked to a lot of <span class=""audionotes"">primary industries</span>, so things like, say like, oil or mining or timber from like forests and right now I think there's a high demand for those kind of products, so  because of that it's pushed the Canadian dollar up. But also I think many other currencies have gone down a bit, like the American dollar has dropped a lot.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Really. OK.</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>I don't follow the currency markets too closely.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>OK, I see.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> But I think because the American dollar has gone down as well, that means that, you know, it doesn't take as much Canadian money to equal the American money now, so I think those are probably two of the reasons why it's been strong.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> I see. I know that Canada is a country which is really rich in the natural resources, but are there still a lot of natural resources left now.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> That's another good question. I think that there are still quite  a lot of resources.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Oh, nice.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Which is, you know, is good but some of them are decreasing quite a bit.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> I think so, because of <span class=""audionotes"">consumption</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> It's too...</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Too big.</p>     <p><strong>Brian: </strong>Right.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> And we export a lot of our resources too, so, you know, the Unites States is always taking a lot of our resources so that's like a huge market right there, but I think there's still lots of oil but maybe the... some of the trees, you know, they cut them down pretty fast and they take a long time to grow back, so you have to watch out there.</p>     <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>OK, I think that's a very reason for the strong Canadian dollar.</p>     <p><strong>Brian:</strong> It could be but you probably should ask an economist. Maybe they can tell you a bit more informed insight than I can.</p>               "

"                  <strong>Lindsay: </strong>So if you buy a game, how long does it take you to beat the game? One year or fifteen hours or what?     <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Well, maybe the shortest one are only about six hours but it all depends on how much you're playing it. If it's something I really like, sometimes I can't put it down and I just keep playing it and I finish it in a few days and sometimes, well, it's alright but <span class=""audionotes"">I can't get myself to keep playing</span> it so sometimes it can take me a few months to finish a game.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Oh, OK. So do you think you're a very skillful video game player?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> No, I'm pretty bad sometimes, especially at the newer games. I'm better at the old ones.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> One final question, do you think it's more important to beat the actual video game or when you're playing with someone to beat the person that you're playing with?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">What do you mean?</span></p>     <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>So, you know, when you're friend comes over and you're both playing the video games together and you're competing against one each other, or is it better to actually like beat the video game itself? Does that <span class=""audionotes"">make sense</span>? Don't you usually against your friend?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Yeah, sometimes I play against my friends, but it seems like there's less goal to it when you're playing against someone else. You win sometimes and you lose sometimes, but once you finish the game, then you can feel like <span class=""audionotes"">you've accomplished something</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>Oh, OK. Have you ever been so addicted to a game, and then you finished it and you were disappointed because you liked the game so much?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Actually, that happens a lot. Sometimes you finish a game that you really like and you wish there were more games that you could keep playing it.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> OK, that happens to me but that's when I am reading a book, or yeah, usually when I'm reading a book or finish a long project but I can't imagine that happening with a video game.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> It's exactly the same as with a book or with a TV series or something else that you really enjoy. When it's finished...</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">It's bitter sweet</span>, right?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Yes, exactly.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Lindsay:</strong> So, since we are talking about technology, I have a question for you. Is there any gadget or technology that you're really addicted to?     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> That would have to be video games. I have pretty much every video game console that was releases since the late 80's.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Are you serious?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Yes. Every one of them.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Wow. I actually don't really like video games.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Why not? They're fun.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> I don't know. I used to when I was a kid, but recently <span class=""audionotes"">they just don't appeal to me</span>... to sit in front and like, use my thumb to press this thing to make it jump and I guess I'm just not very good at them.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Well, they're getting more and <span class=""audionotes"">more involving now</span>, it's kind of like having an interactive movie except you get to be the main character in the movie.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, I guess. I need to <span class=""audionotes"">get used to it</span>. I'm really bad at them right now, so I'm just not comfortable with them.</p>     <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Yeah, I know what you mean. One thing I've noticed a lot with games lately is that they're so complicated to control that you have to be like a <span class=""audionotes"">hard core gamer</span> to even begin to understand how to play the game.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Do you think you're a hard core gamer?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> I would have to say I am though <span class=""audionotes"">I'm not exactly proud of it</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Oh, really. What <span class=""audionotes"">constitutes</span> a hard core gamer? How often to you play?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Pretty much, well, probably for most hard core gamers, it would be every day.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Every day. How many hours?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> An hour or two, at the least.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> OK, what about you? How often do you play every day?</p>     <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Well, since, I'm working, there are lots of days when I don't play at all, and I would like to be able to play more.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> OK, so one of your goals in life is to play more video games?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> No, I wouldn't say that but it's a good way to relax and sometimes it's more fun than just watching TV when you have nothing better to do.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> OK, so you play... try to play every day but sometimes you don't and then, are there any tips you can give me to become a good video gamer?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Well, just the more you can play, the more better you'll get. I don't necessarily want to play more because as you know there isn't really any reward for playing games more.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Jake: </strong>So, Lyndsay do you like to text message a lot on your cell phone ?     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, actually, I text message a lot.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> I don't do it so much. Sometimes I prefer to just call someone on the phone if <span class=""audionotes"">I'm in a hurry</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>Yeah, <span class=""audionotes"">I go both ways</span>. Sometimes I know I don't really want to talk to the person. I just want to ask them one question, so it's so much easier for me just to text them and say, Are you going to the party tonight for example instead of calling them, because I know if I call them, I'm gonna have to have a long conversation.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Yeah, <span class=""audionotes"">I can see what you mean</span>. Well, usually I get off the phone pretty quickly when I call someone. <span class=""audionotes"">I'm not a big talker</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, that's true, Jake. You don't talk a lot. But, in general, I like to call people because I think it adds <span class=""audionotes"">a more personal touch</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> So are you fast at writing the messages with your thumb?</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Well, when I first got a cell phone, which was actually only five years ago, I was so slow, I thought I would never text message, and I always called people, but then people kept text messaging me so I felt obligated to try to learn how to text message, so now, I'm pretty fast actually. What about you?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Actually, I have the opposite problem, where when I first got my cell phone, I thought it was so cool and I had to text message all my friends who had one, and I was pretty fast with my thumb then, but it seems like now I don't use it so much, and I've gotten slower actually.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, I think the text message actually is sort of has to do with your age, for example, I text message a lot and I know people younger than me, for example people in high school, they text message a lot, but I asked my father if he text messages, and guess what he said?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> What?</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>Well, of course, he said he never text messages. He thinks it's very <span class=""audionotes"">juevenile</span> and unprofessional to text message someone.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Yeah, I can see what he means. It's usually associated with young people and considered pretty informal to text message someone.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, it is really informal, I think, because you're just using your thumb and you're trying to write fast. Rarely do you ever write 'dear' or 'from' or use polite language, right?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Yeah, because you're using your thumb, you have to write the messages as short as you possibly can.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay</strong>: Right, I mean, it sort of makes sense, when I think that I would never text message someone I didn't know very well. I only text message people I'm good friends with and comfortable with.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Well, it serves it purpose then, doesn't it.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>Yeah, I guess, I mean it is cheaper than calling someone, but, you know, other times it's better to call someone, don't you think.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Yeah, definitely.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Lindsay:</strong> So, Jake we were just talking about zoos. Now, I'm curious. What do you think about hunting? Do you like hunting?           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Not really. I know a lot of people who do hunt though. </p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> What do they hunt?</p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Well, deer mostly and sometimes grouse and different birds. </p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Do they use a gun or a bow and arrow?</p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>They use guns.</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, I don't know about hunting. I'm not a really big fan of hunting.</p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Yeah, a lot of people enjoy it I guess, and plus they get to eat the animals after they hunt them.</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, my father was a very big hunter. He actually kept a big rifle gun and would go pheasant hunting twice a year. He would always come back with this nasty pheasant and put it in our freezer but my mom never knew how to cook it so it would just stay in our freezer forever. </p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>So you never ate the pheasant?</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> We never ate the pheasant. But in general both my mom and I were very upset with my father for hunting. We just didn't think he needed to go out and shoot poor animals. </p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>But he must have really enjoyed it to go against you and your mother's wishes and go hunting all the time.</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> That's a good point. He did really enjoy it and basically he just did what he wanted to do, but have you ever eaten a hunted deer?</p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Yes, I have, and it was pretty good actually.</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Does it taste different than cow?</p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>It's not the same as cow definitely, but it's not a really unusual tasting meat either, I would say.</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> OK, so someone went and hunted the deer and then served it to you?</p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Yes.</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> And that was OK for you?</p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Yes, it was OK for me because I eat cow and chicken all the time and I don't see how that's different.</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, but this deer was in the wild, and what if it was a mother?</p>           <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Well, some of the cows that we eat are mothers as well.</p>           <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> You think so? I never really thought about that. I guess you're right, but something about the idea of going out and shooting a poor deer. It just reminds me of Bambi. It's so sad.</p>               "
"                    <strong>Jake:</strong> Hey, Lindsay, would you like to go with me to the zoo this Saturday?   <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> The zoo.</p>   <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Yeah, it's gonna be lot's of fun. We're going to see lions and tigers and bears.</p>   <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Oh, my? Actually, I don't really like the zoo.</p>   <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Why not. I thought everyone liked the zoo.</p>   <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> I don't think it's natural for the animals to be in a cage.</p>   <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Yeah, I can see your point but on the other hand, zoos often rescue the animals in the wild that couldn't survive on their own, and I hear that zoos often take very good care of the animals and they have an even longer <span class=""audionotes"">life expectancy</span> than they would have in the wild.</p>   <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, I agree with you. I think the animals do live longer in the zoo, but my problem is more the fact that it's just not natural. For example, I once saw a polar bear in California. A polar bear should not be in a warm climate. It should be in a cold climate where there's snow.</p>   <p><strong>Jake:</strong> OK, <span class=""audionotes"">you got me there</span>.</p>   <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>Yes, I think I did. But I understand your point that zoos could be good, especially for the animals and the fact that they rescue the animals. I mean, that's nice. But, I think that you know, animals should die in the wild.</p>   <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Well, I think it's better that they're alive so that people can enjoy them.</p>   <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> So you think the purpose of animals is for them to be enjoyed?</p>   <p><strong>Jake:</strong> No, no, but it's really interesting for us to be able to learn about the animals and <span class=""audionotes"">see them in person</span> instead of just on TV.</p>   <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> I guess I agree with you, but I don't know, I don't really think the purpose of the animals are for our pleasure. I think animals should be out in the wild living freely.</p>   <p><strong>Jake:</strong> OK, are you opposed to circuses too?</p>   <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Oh, absolutely. I think they're very <span class=""audionotes"">cruel to animals</span>. Animals should not be there performing and living in close quarters and not being able to move around freely.</p>   <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Well, I can see your point but I still think zoos and circuses are a lot of fun and I like to go to them a lot.</p>   <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>OK, I guess we'll just have to disagree a lot of this one. Have fun at the zoo Jake.</p> "
"                  <strong>Lindsay:</strong> So Jake, we are thinking of getting a dog. What do you think about that?     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Well, that could be a good idea. Dogs can make good companions.</p>     <p><strong>Lyndsay: </strong>Yeah, I think so. That's why we want to get one, but the problem is our apartment is really small. Do you think my apartment is too small for the dog?</p>     <p><strong>Jake: </strong>It could be. Dogs can get very lonely too is don't take care of them.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Yeah, <span class=""audionotes"">everyone keeps warning me</span> about the fact that not only is my apartment small but I'm not home a lot and either is my fiance so the dog will be home a lot of the time by itself.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Well, then maybe <span class=""audionotes"">you'd better reconsider getting one</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Lyndsay:</strong> But they're so cute and I'll walk it in the morning and when I come home from work. I mean, do you think that that will be OK for the dog?</p>     <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Well, I'm not so sure. Personally, I don't really see what's so great about having a dog anyway.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Oh, what! You don't like dogs?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Not really. I mean, well, first of all, I'm a little bit afraid of them. I think maybe I was attacked when I was very young, but I don't like them very much.</p>     <p><strong>Lyndsay: </strong>So you're afraid of them or you don't like them, or both?</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Both. I think also, sometimes they're kind of dirty inside of the house. They leave lots of pet hair and sometimes they're not properly <span class=""audionotes"">toilet trained</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>Well, of course. They're like babies. You have to train them to go outside, but once they're trained they can be wonderful <span class=""audionotes"">companions</span>, and I don't know they're pretty soft and cute and lovable.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> But I don't think it's worth the extra work. You have to clean up after them and of course, like you said, you have to train them.</p>     <p><strong>Lyndsay:</strong> But a dog will always love you. There's not another animal that's like that? That will always love you no matter what. Don't you think so? Can you think of another animal that will always love you?</p>     <p><strong>Jake: </strong>Cats maybe. </p>     <p><strong>Lindsay: </strong>No way. Cats are so <span class=""audionotes"">finicky</span>. Cats don't really like you, I feel like. I feel like the dog is there right when you walk in the door waiting for you to come home. A cat is out next door walking on the fence. They don't care about you.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> Yeah, you're right. I think dogs are more friendly than cats overall.</p>     <p><strong>Lyndsay:</strong> I think you're just afraid of dogs because you haven't had a good experience with a dog, but if I get a dog than you can come to my house and play with my dog.</p>     <p><strong>Jake:</strong> I am sure I would like your dog.</p>     <p><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Oh, good. OK. So please come to my house and play with my new dog, if I get one. I'm not sure yet.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, hey, Rebecca, speaking of environmental stuff, I was reading about a drought in Australia. You guys have a serious drought problem with water?     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, we do. We've had a drought for some time now and it seems to be getting worse and worse each year. At the moment, it depends on the area that  you're in, but some areas are quite hard-hitted. We actually have restrictions on water now so you can't wash your car unless it's with a bucket of water. You can't water your garden at all, so my mom loves gardening, so to keep her garden, dad actually has fitted a special tube into the washing machine which filters the water out out into a bucket outside and she can use that grey water to water all her plants and that way she can keep her garden all nice.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's fantastic. You call it grey water?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Mm. We call it grey water.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Is it only water from the washing machine?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, it is. We haven't done anything else with the shower water or anything, yet, and I think with the soaps that we use, they're more... not as hard on the plants, so they're actually growing really well.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really. Actually, the garden is doing better with the grey water than normal water?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah. Especially grass. Yeah, I don't know, maybe something in the water that they really love.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. All those dirt nutrients from the clothes.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> From the clothes, yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, has the government done anything like to raise water prices or limit how much water you can use per month or anything like that?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> There's a certain limit on water and then after that limit's reached, you actually pay quite a fair bit for water. Bottles of water have gone up to about three to four dollars for just a hundred-fifty <span class=""audionotes"">mil-bottles</span>, so it's quite expensive. Yeah, so water prices are quite high now.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, basically, everybody in Australia just has to hope that in the future there'll be more rain?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I think the problem is that with the rains, it needs to rain into the basins where we catch the water so, if it doesn't rain into them, then the water's just useless to us when it rains. It just <span class=""audionotes"">runs off</span>because the ground's so dry.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, you just have <span class=""audionotes"">the run-off</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, have you had other things like flooding or anything like that because of the drought?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> In certain areas when there's been big rainfalls, there has been a lot of flooding because the ground just doesn't <span class=""audionotes"">soak it up</span>. It's that dry, but other areas have got water so because Australia is so <span class=""audionotes"">vast</span>, so wide as well, yeah, there's different areas that are hit differently.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, that's terrible. Well, I hope it gets better.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, so do I.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Rebecca, talking about your country, I hear that skin cancer is a serious problem in Australia?     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, it is. I think our environment is the cause of it <span class=""audionotes"">in a way</span> because we do have the beautiful beaches that you always want to go out and swim and be in the sun, have the barbecue, so you're outside a lot, especially during the time of the day that it is really quite stong.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, so is the government doing anything, or do people do anything to try to prevent it?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, the government's put out the slogan, <span class=""audionotes"">Slip, slop, and slap</span> so slip on some sun screen, slap on a hat, and yeah, something along those lines.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, it works, right. Is skin cancer cases going down?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I think the deaths from skin cancer are going down. The number of cases of skin cancer that are increasing still, maybe it's because they can check and see if you're going to get it earlier than what they used to, but, yeah they're able to sort of reduce the cases a bit, which is great.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So have this changed the culture? Are people less wanting to be tan?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> No, I don't think so. There's a lot of products coming out on the market now where you get the tanning products, so I suppose they're helping you tan <span class=""audionotes"">in a way</span> that's not putting you out in the sun, but yeah, it's just the culture is to get outside and enjoy the sun. You do see down on the beach, everyone laying down on the beach, <span class=""audionotes"">sun baking</span>, enjoying the sun, but I think more so now, you see that they are putting on sun screen too, which is really good to hear.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, what about you? Are you somebody who tans very easily? </p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I am. I suppose, I'm the lucky few people that don't have to sit out in the sun <span class=""audionotes"">for ages</span> to tan, but I do still like to put on the sun screen a lot. Every time I go outside I make sure I got it on. Especially, around the ears and nose. They tend to be major parts that skin cancer can form now.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, yeah, it's winter right now and you still look pretty tan.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Ah, thank you.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Rebecca, in Australia you have the Great Barrier Reef. Now have you been to the Great Barrier Reef?     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yes, I have once, probably about two years ago. There's the main part of the Great Barrier Reef and then there's a little island, and we went to the island because I don't like scuba diving, so I didn't go to the main part.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, you don't like scuba diving. Why?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I think it's <span class=""audionotes"">the unknown</span>, under the water, and just being confined and having this <span class=""audionotes"">breathing aparatus</span> on you.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Right. Well, you know what, <span class=""audionotes"">I can relate</span> because I was certified to be a diver because all my friends were divers and I didn't enjoy it that much either.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah. Like, it looks great underwater when you see it on TV and it would be awesome to see it, but yeah, <span class=""audionotes"">I just can't get past the going underwater</span> and not being able breathe properly.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. Right. Actually, I think for me was I went with my friends and they were so excited about it and then when you would go under water, you're in pairs. You have a buddy and it seemed like you were kind of in line in an amusement park or something, you know.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Really.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, like everybody kind of has to go around and you look around and you see all these other divers and... but I was the only person that felt this way. Everybody else loves diving and the photography so. But actually, is it true the Barrier Reef is being damaged? It's actually not as beautiful as used to be?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah. It's... The name of it is coral bleaching, and the coral is actually turning white, now rather than having the colors it has, so that's been happening for a few years I think and <span class=""audionotes"">it's getting worse and worse</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, so basically the coral is losing it's beautiful color?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, yeah, basically, just dies and can't be <span class=""audionotes"">brought back</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, what about, like you know, the marine life, like you know fish and stuff like that? Is that still abundant?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I assume that would probably go down as well once the coral starts to die off because that is the food source and their housing for the fish so with the loss of the Great Barrier Reef you also lose all the beautiful fish and marine life down there too.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's too bad.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Rebecca, let's talk about things we wish could do that we can't do. What is something you wish you could do, that you can't do now?     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I think it would be definitely playing music, like playing a guitar. Some of my friends can just <span class=""audionotes"">pull out</span> a guitar and start singing and then you have everybody around and it's such a great night. I just wish I could join them and actually, yeah, have fun with that as well, but no, I can't play guitar.</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, if you could play any instrument, it would be the guitar?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I have played piano and saxophone before but not overly that well.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh, really so you actually had musical training?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, when I was in high school.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> In the piano and the saxophone?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yep. Yeah. The saxophone was maybe for one or two years and I would love to <span class=""audionotes"">get back into</span> playing that as well, but they're quite expensive little <span class=""audionotes"">instruments</span> actually.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah. Slightly.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> And then the piano is very large so, you can't really transport that around with you wherever you go.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So do you think that if had learned music at a younger age, you would still be with it? Was the problem just that you waited to late in life to start?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I don't think so. I think it's more the friends circle that I was with. We weren't really a musical group and the people that I've met now are really musical so you sort of wish maybe if I had <span class=""audionotes"">kept going</span> I could have joined them now, but I do enjoy listening to them.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Well, what about singing? Are you a good singer?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> No. Not at all. I don't think I want to be a good singer either cause then everybody would expect you to sing all the time so I just do <span class=""audionotes"">backup vocals</span>. Really badly.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, I'm the same way. I can't sing at all. OK, so basically you wish you could play the guitar, but you have played the piano and the saxophone before.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, is there anything else that you wish you could do?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> To be able to speak maybe a couple languages would be nice.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, that's a good one. So if you could speak any two languages, what two would you want to speak?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I think Japanese and Spanish.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Japanese and Spanish.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. They both sound really interesting and they're both the countries that I would like to go and visit and maybe attempt to work there but you need to be able to speak the language before you can work.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. That's true. I think if I could choose any two languages I would choose Chinese and Arabic just because both those languages when I hear them they sound so completely impossible to speak, so if you could speak those, that would be pretty amazing.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, definitely. Yeah, Chinese sounds like a hard language.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">All those tones</span>.</p>               "
"                      <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I thought we would talk a little bit about personality traits. So, I'm gonna give you a quiz.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Oh,God, I'll probably fail.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, the first one is, do you <span class=""audionotes"">procrastinate</span>? Are you a procrastinator?</p>          <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yes. For certain things. And also for study.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Cause you're a student?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yes. Yes. So. When I have study to do, it just more ahhhhh, there's other things that I could be doing.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, so if you have a paper or something, you wait till the night before?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah. It's always <span class=""audionotes"">last minute</span>. I've heard that if you were a last minute person in high school, you will always be a last minute person throughout your life, so it doesn't leave much hope for me.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You're <span class=""audionotes"">set for life</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yep.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Next is, are you somebody who worries a lot?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Sometimes. Yes. Probably when I need to plan things. Yeah. Then I'll worry about if everything is OK, but other times it's just... I'll just <span class=""audionotes"">go with the flow</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Go with the flow. Do you worry about things like money or do you worry about things like like the future or stuff like that? Or are you pretty much easy going and...?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I sort of do think about the future a bit and worry a little bit of you know, what's gonna happen, but other than that, no, I just see what happens. <span class=""audionotes"">Money-wise</span>, not really worry about it too much. I can't budget, so I don't worry about money.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, that last one is, what about details? Are you somebody who's really <span class=""style6"">picky about detail</span>?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yes. I'm with paperwork. When something's written, or advertising things like that. At work, yeah, I was always very picky about the grammar or making sure that everything was in same font and lined up squarely so, yeah, but other than that, no.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, then, just lastly, are you good at planning? Do you like to plan things?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I do. Yeah, I've planned a holiday for my family over Christmas and New Years and that worked out really well, so yeah, I can plan things. Sometimes I plan like the future a bit too much, but yeah. Apart from that.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's interesting. So in your real life, you're very organized and you plan, but in your student life, you procrastinate.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Completely two different lives I think.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Mike, you're giving tips about weight training and we've talked about upper body. Now what about lower body and legs? I actually don't want to lift weights with my legs. I just... It is OK if I just <span class=""audionotes"">skip it</span>?     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, you should do your legs because you should get a <span class=""audionotes"">full body workout</span> because if you just do one part of your body it affect the other parts of your body as well, so you need to be balanced.</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so I'm convinced. I'm gonna work on my legs. What's the most basic exercise I should do?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>I think you should start off squatting. That's where you put... make sure you have a squat rack, and you put the bar behind your head on your shoulders and you just squat as if you are sitting on a bench and come back up.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Now often I see guys in the gym that do that. They have the big weight belt. Do I need to get a weight belt?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>It would be good, that if you're <span class=""audionotes"">just starting off</span> to use the weight belt but once you <span class=""audionotes"">get the motion</span> I would advise you to to not use the weight belt so that it forces you to keep <span class=""audionotes"">good posture</span> yourself.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, when you do the squat, like how low should I go. Should I go until I'm almost sitting on the floor?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>As is there was a bench underneath your.....</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Bottom?<br />       <br />       <strong>Mike:</strong> Bottom.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Right. Yeah, right. So basically, your legs and your knees should be about 90 degrees.</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so that's... that will work out all my legs? That's all I have to do is squats?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah, that's probably the best one you can do.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and that is for my calves and my hamstrings too?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Not your calves but for your hamstrings and your bottom.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. So what should I do for my calves?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> You can do calf raises, which is... you can do it on a squat rack, and you just hold the bar in the same position as you would a squat and just raise your legs up on your toes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so in terms of how... of sets, like how many sets should I do of the squats?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> I think you should start of with three sets.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Three sets.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> The same as the other exercises.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>And about ten reps?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>And about ten reps, yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So do I always keep the weight constant? I don't have the weight go up or down?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, once you get used to the motion and the position that you're in, then you can start increasing the weights as you go.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, but I mean, each set should be the same weight.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, when you're starting off.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, yeah. And also just for the calves, just do three sets?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yep, just do three sets.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Alright.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, thanks a lot, Mike. I'm gonna get started.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> OK, Mike, you are fit, and you got me motivated. I want to work out, so I thought I would ask you about a work out routine, so first let's talk about upper body? What should I do for my chest and shoulders?     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, the first basic chest work-out is the bench press, where you use the straight bar, and you should probably do three sets, if you're starting out: three sets, doing ten reps each set. </p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, three sets would mean I do it three times with rest in between, correct?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> And how much time should I rest between each set?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Maybe a minute-and-half,  two minutes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, and then when I do each set, so you say I do ten reps, that means I lift the weights ten times?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and I should do heavy enough weight that I can only do it ten?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah, you should lift weight that is heavy enough to where you can only do it ten times.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so, that's gonna build my chest and my shoulders?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>That will build your chest.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK and then what about my shoulders? What can I do for my shoulders?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, a good one is the military press which, there's usually good machines for that, where you sit down and you just press the bar above your head.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so you think it's better that I do this on a machine than <span class=""audionotes"">free weights</span>?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, if you're just starting out, I think you should do it on a machine. It's probably safer. You can get the motion down and then it puts less strain on your back.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and when I do this, again I should do it about ten reps?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, about the same.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, now when I lift should I do it like really quick and fast or like slow?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> You should bring weight down slow and <span class=""audionotes"">explode up</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, so I lower the bar slowly and then push up as quick as possible?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah, and you do that ten times.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so we've got my chest workout, we've got my shoulder work-out. What about my arms? I want big arms, Mike. <span class=""audionotes"">I want guns</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, for arms, there's a lot of good exercises, usually for your <span class=""audionotes"">biceps</span>, the basic would be dumbbell curl, or straight bar curl, which you use the large straight bar, so you just stand and hold the bar in front of you, and just bring it up towards your chest.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. Is there any dos and don'ts about lifting the bar, like things I should be careful of?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Just make sure that your back is straight and that your stomach muscles are tight so that it keeps you solid.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, I need to keep my <span class=""audionotes"">torso</span>, my chest, very straight and not move to much?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yes. Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK and the same as before: ten reps?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yep, that's the same as well.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>OK, so do the curls. Alright. I'm set. I hope I'm gonna get pumped, MIke.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Mike, I thought we would talk about weight training. You're kind of an expert. I see you in the gym a lot. You're always, you know, lifting weights. How did you get involved in weight training?     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Well, I started in high school. I've played sports since I  was little and once I got to high school, we had to start weight training for our team.</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and so did you just start with like, you know, the basics, like free weights or did you do like the machines?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, well, we had a weight lifting coach so we did both machines and free weights and he made sure that our form was correct and we did everything properly, so.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, now, actually which did you prefer, the machines or the free weights?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>I prefer free weights. Yeah, I think machine is a little bit <span class=""audionotes"">more restrictive</span> than free weights so if you know how to... if you have <span class=""audionotes"">proper guidance</span>, then free weights are better.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So, actually you play soccer. Is that correct?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>See, that's interesting cause I wouldn't think that soccer players would <span class=""audionotes"">be into</span> weight training.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, that's the usual way of thinking for a lot of people, but actually now people into playing soccer are doing a lot more weights.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> But when you lift weights, don't you feel that you're more tight? Or you're tighter? That you're not flexible?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, but that means that you have to stretch. Do a lot of stretching as well.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, stretching is just as important as the weight training?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yes.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, well, you don't play soccer anymore, do you?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> No, after college I've retired from competitive sports.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, do you still <span class=""audionotes"">follow the same regiment</span> that you did with your soccer training?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> No. Weight lifting when you're not playing sports is different than when you are playing sports, so now I just lift to <span class=""audionotes"">keep fit</span> and not actually for sports performance.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, that's interesting. Like, what is different about doing weight training for sports and doing it just to be fit?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> The exercises vary a lot. If you're doing, for sports, you do things that you need to do a lot of explosion work so that you can move faster or better and... whereas if you're just staying fit, you just do more to get exercise and you know, to keep your shape.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> When you were going down the Amazon did you see any wildlife? Lots of animals?     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> None!  We didn't see any. We didn't see an alligator. We didn't see a monkey. We didn't see a snake.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You didn't see one snake?</p>          <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Nope. The villagers... I think they hunt animals for food, for their food, so I think the animals know and they stay away from the side of the river. They stay away from the villages, so if you want to see animals, you have to go further into the jungle, but it's very dangerous and it's difficult, so we didn't go far from the river's edge.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, so you never <span class=""audionotes"">ventured</span> in the jungle.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>You can't. You really can't. It's too thick. You need <span class=""audionotes"">a machete</span> to <span class=""audionotes"">hack your way through</span>.  You need someone who knows where they're going. A guide with you. It's not... you just can't go on a nice walk in this kind of Amazon jungle. It's dangerous, it's difficult.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, how many days did it take you to get down the river?</p>     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I think it took us, say, fifteen days.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>The distance wasn't so far. I was only I say 300 kilometers but the canoes go straight down. There wasn't any public transport. These canoes were just transporting good from one village to the next, so we had to wait until a transport canoe came along, and then we just <span class=""audionotes"">hitched a ride</span> to the next village. Wait there for a day or two and then hitch a ride to the next village so a very <span class=""audionotes"">unorthodox</span> kind of travel. No tour buses. No trains. No taxis. So..</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, that sounds like a pretty amazing trip.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> mm, it was lots of fun, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Jeff, we're talking about your trip down the Amazon, and so you took a truck to the Amazon and then you got a canoe. You got on a canoe. Can you talk about your journey down the Amazon?     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> The Amazon... What people think of the Amazon is a beautiful river with a nice green jungle and lots of animals, and it's not like that. It's not a beautiful place. It was... the river was muddy and dirty. It looked like coffee. The side of the river, the side of the Amazon was very <span class=""audionotes"">overgrown</span> and full of mosquitos and black flies. We didn't see any wild animals because the canoe was just a long, thin wooden canoe <span class=""audionotes"">piled high</span> with things like rice and food other materials that the villagers needed and it had an <span class=""audionotes"">outboard motor</span> that was very noisy, so it wasn't romantic at all, the ideas of the Amazon river, and the beauty and the adventure. It was difficult and dirty and hot and dangerous, so <span class=""audionotes"">it wasn't romantic at all</span>.</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> It doesn't sound like it. Where did you stay as you would go down? Would you sleep on the canoe?</p>     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>No. Every night they would stop at a little village, and it was just made out of little village, a little <span class=""audionotes"">cluster</span> of bamboo thatched houses just on the side of the river. They'd clear a little spot out of the jungle and then they'd have a, say a dozen bamboo houses there and we'd sleep say on the floor of one of their houses in our sleeping bags.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Were these houses made especially for travellers?</p>     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>No, no. There was no travelers. There's no houses for travelers. These are just with the villagers. There's no restaurants or no hotels. There are no internet cafes. Half the villages didn't have power, so it was real basic village life.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow! </p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Jeff, we're talking about your trip across the Amazon. So you met this guy, this Russian guy, who was going to go with you across the Amazon, and you were in Lima, Peru, so how does your journey start?     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> The beginning of the journey is we had to get a truck. We had to get in a truck and the roads are terrible. They're not really roads. They're <span class=""audionotes"">dirt tracks</span>, and because it was monsoon season, the roads were really bad - just muddy and deep mud and the rivers were <span class=""audionotes"">overflowing</span> across the road so... there's no buses. There are no cars. So we had to get in the back of a big truck, a logging truck, and the Russian guy and myself and say twenty <span class=""audionotes"">peasants</span>, Inca Indian peasants, rode in the back of the truck down the... through the Andes Mountains and then down the backside of the Andes Mountains for four days in the back of this truck.</p>          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That must have been so uncomfortable. </p>     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Oh, it was terribly uncomfortable, and it was raining quite often during the day, so you had to pull a big piece of plastic over the back of the truck, so it was dark and wet and damp and hot and humid and the road was <span class=""audionotes"">bumpy</span> and the truck got stuck many times, and it was... yeah it was a real adventure.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That was for four days?</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Four days, yeah. Yep. Yep. And you'd sleep in the truck overnight, and yeah, you just... everyone had big bags of food with them so they could eat along the way cause there's no restaurants. Yeah, it was interesting.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, in this rough beginning to the trip, did you start to think maybe you wanted not do it, postpone it and go back?</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> No, I never thought that. I like that kind of challenge and adventure but you just wonder how difficult it's going to get because each day gets a little more difficult and then the truck gets in really deep mud and you wonder can we get out of this? Are we going to have to start walking and maybe wait for another truck to <span class=""audionotes"">come along</span> and climb into that truck, so you never... I didn't want to go back, but you just.... <span class=""audionotes"">it's great suspense</span> cause you never know what's going to happen on a trip like that.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> And then the truck took you all the way to the beginning of the Amazon.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yep. It was a transport truck so it had supplies and it was going to the... to a little town at the Amazon River and then from there we transferred into a canoe, a wooden canoe and the canoe would take the supplies into the little villages along the Amazon River.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Amazing.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Jeff, you mentioned to me that you went across the Amazon in Brazil.     <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Yes. Yes. I was going to South America and when I do a trip I don't like to be a regular tourist and just go and sightsee, so I got an idea from a National Geographic magazine to go straight across South America from the Pacific Ocean in Peru, starting in Peru, across to the Atlantic Ocean on the opposite side in Brazil and you have to go through the Andes Mountains and then you have to go across and through the Amazon, so that's what I did.</p>          <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That's fantastic.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> It was a good trip.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> How did you go? Did you travel alone? I mean <span class=""audionotes"">it must have been dangerous</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> It was. It was dangerous. It was high season, <span class=""audionotes"">monsoon season</span>, so the river was high, and of course they speak Spanish in South America and I can't speak Spanish and I was traveling alone and I didn't want to travel alone. It's too dangerous, so I had to look for another travel partner who was a little bit <span class=""audionotes"">as crazy as I was</span> to do this trip, so when I arrived in Lima, the capitol of Peru, I started looking around for someone else who looked like a tough, good traveller, and one night in my guesthouse, this bald Russian guy came into the guesthouse carrying a big pack, and he had a big pack with a tent, a sleeping bag strapped to it and he had a big machete hanging off his belt, and I said <span class=""audionotes"">this guys perfect</span>, so went up and talked to him.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> He sounds a little bit like Indiana Jones.</p>     <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Oh, he was great. He was a great guy, and his wife is Mexican so he spoke perfect Spanish, so I told him my idea and he was <span class=""audionotes"">gung ho</span>. He was ready to do it.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mari:</strong> Hey, Mike, so we live in the countryside, and we go to school up on a mountain. Could you see yourself living here?     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, I do really like living in the country, but I don't think I could stay here for a long period of time, even though I do like staying here for the period that we are here now. </p>          <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Where do you want to live?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, I've never lived in  a big city, so I think that I would like to try to live in a big city.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Like which one?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong><span class=""audionotes"">Possibly one</span> like New York or London. I think, I've always seen it on TV and I've always wanted to try to live there but I've never, so I thing that would probably be really interesting.</p>     <p><strong>Mari: </strong><span class=""audionotes"">What attracts you</span> to those cities?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> I guess just the diversity that you might find or just the fact that so much <span class=""audionotes"">stuff is going on</span> in the city. I might like to see how that lifestyle is.</p>     <p><strong>Mari: </strong>Sounds cool.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> What about you?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I couldn't see myself living here in the long-term. I grew up in two really big cities so... and I've moved around a lot and... so in the future, I think I just want to stay in one place.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> What types of cities?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I guess a big city in Japan. My parents live here, so I feel like I'm <span class=""audionotes"">more inclined</span> to live here. My brother lives in the States and so if we both lived in the United States, I think my parents would feel a little bit lonely so I feel more inclined to live in Japan.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Which city in Japan would you like?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> My parents live near Osaka. I grew up in Tokyo. I'm thinking maybe like Kobe. I think that... I like Kobe a lot because it's like an international port city, or originally it was. We have the ocean, the water, and the mountain and it just seems like a very <span class=""audionotes"">cosmopolitan</span> city to me in Japan.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mike:</strong> Hey, Mari. So, we're comparing places this week and you've lived in two great cities: Tokyo and New York and you speak both English and Japanese so you must know them very well, so can you tell me about the people in the places?     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> In New York City, the people are friendly. If you're lost in the subway or you're not sure which bus to take, if you ask someone, even though they look pretty busy or <span class=""audionotes"">absorbed</span> they'll be willing to tell you which way you are supposed to go, and they'll be very <span class=""audionotes"">blunt</span> and tell you if they don't know which one you're supposed to take. When you go into the stores, the people in the stores are... they like to <span class=""audionotes"">make small talk</span> with you. They're interested in you as a person in terms of where you're from or you know, what you are looking for that day and why you are looking for that item. </p>          <p>I think in Tokyo, if you are in the subway station, or the train station, the JR people or the subway people are very helpful in terms of which subway you're supposed to go on, or to help you get to that destination, but when you go into the stores, the clerks are very helpful in terms of finding whatever you're looking for, but I think because of the culture, they're not... they don't <span class=""audionotes"">delve into your personal life</span> as much as the shop attendants in New York.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> So in terms of food, how does it differ between New York and Tokyo?</p>     <p><strong>Mari: </strong>I think New York and Tokyo both have very international foods. In both cities, you can find foods from all over the world. I think that because New York City is a <span class=""audionotes"">city of immigrants</span>, you get very... the people who cook the foods are from that country, while in Japan I feel like if you go to a Mexican restaurant and you see like a Japanese person cooking the Mexican food, so I think that the cuisine, the international cuisine in New York City is more real versus the one in Japan.</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>So, if you had to eat one thing in New York and one thing in Tokyo, what would it be?</p>     <p><strong>Mari: </strong>Oh, my gosh, that's a very difficult question. In New York City I would eat pizza. I think that they have the best pizza in the world. If you like greasy, cheesy pizza. In Japan, I really like the Italian food in Japan. I know that it's not very authentic Italian food but I think they do a really good job with Italian food here.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Oh, that's interesting. So, in terms of shopping, where would you like to shop more?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I feel like I'm going to be biased towards New York City but I think that the shopping in New York City is a lot better. The primary reason being that it's just cheaper.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mari:</strong> This week's theme is comparing cities. Mike, you've lived in both Florida and Hawaii, and both of these places, people go there on vacation, so can you compare the weather?     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, actually both places are warm most of the year. Well, actually Hawaii is warm all year. But I would say that Hawaii's weather is probably better than Florida because the weather in Hawaii is <span class=""audionotes"">not as extreme</span> as it is in Florida and... so where as the temperatures in Florida would <span class=""audionotes"">range from</span> fifty degree to ninety degrees, in Hawaii it would stay between seventy-five and eighty-five degrees most of the year.</p>          <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Wow. That's really nice weather. How about the food?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well the food, in both places are really good but it's quite different. Both places of course you can get good American food, like burgers and <span class=""audionotes"">that type of thing</span>, but in Florida you get a lot of foods such as Cuban food or Jamaican food which is really good that you can't get in Hawaii, but in Hawaii there's a lot of <span class=""audionotes"">Asian influence</span> so you can get really good Japanese food or Thai food, but also traditional Polynesian food as well.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Wow. <span class=""audionotes"">Sounds yummy</span>. How about the shopping?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Well, the shopping varies between both places. Florida is a lot cheaper than Hawaii. Food shopping as well as clothing and that sort of thing. I guess in Hawaii everything has to be shipped over so it's a little bit more expensive.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I didn't know that. How about the night life?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> The night life in both places are really good. Hawaii has a lot of clubs if you like that type of thing and Florida of course has a lot of clubs if you like that type of thing, but there's also good bars or just movies and shows in both places.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> If you could live in one place, where would you live?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> I would choose to live in Hawaii. Well, I'm from Hawaii so I have a bias towards it, but I think Hawaii would be better between the two places for me.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mike:</strong> Hey, Mari, so you said New York was very diverse. What parts or neighborhoods do you like?     <p><strong>Mari: </strong>I really like <span class=""audionotes"">Soho</span> because there's lots of great shopping to do. Really small shops and really cute restaurants and cafes and then if I'm lucky sometimes when I'm walking around or eating I see like movie stars, so recently before I moved back to Japan I was shopping <span class=""audionotes"">on Broadway</span> and I say Claire Danes with her boyfriend. It was pretty cool.</p>          <p><strong>Mike:</strong> So, I always hear about Central Park. Can you tell me about Central Park?</p>     <p><strong>Mari: </strong>Yeah, Central Park is obviously in the middle of Manhattan. It's really big and people go and play sports or <span class=""audionotes"">they just hang out</span> and walk around. If you go there on the weekends, you see a lot of joggers because the roads are closed off, so there's no cars. Cars are not allowed, and in the summertime you see a lot of roller-bladers, and bikers.</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>How big is the park?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> It's really big. It goes from I think 56th Street to 110th, so it's pretty large.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> So, what other parts?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I went to <span class=""audionotes"">grad school</span> at Colombia so I lived right near Harlem and I actually really like Harlem because you get a very neighborhood feeling. You hear... You see people walking on the street talking to each other. You walk by the barbershop and you know that everyone knows each other. Everyone is interested in the other. They're gossiping about people in their neighborhood.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Is there any area you don't really like?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Because I am from New York City, I really don't like going to Times Square. I feel like it's very <span class=""audionotes"">commercial and touristy</span>, so I really don't like Times Square, but I guess for tourists it's very exciting. There's all these lights and, and I don't know, it's probably very exciting, the side street vendors, the musicians and all these things. It would be exciting for tourists, but I try to avoid it.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mike: </strong>Hey, Mari.     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Hey.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> So, I told you about Florida. How about you tell me something about New York?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> New York, yeah. I was born in New York, and I lived there for a little bit <span class=""audionotes"">over half of my life</span>. There's lots to do in New York.</p>          <p><strong>Mike: </strong>So, what part are you from?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I was born in New York City and then I grew up in <span class=""audionotes"">the suburbs</span> about 40 minutes north of New York City.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> So, what did you do growing up?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> When I was very young I used to go to museums with my parents or go to <span class=""audionotes"">Broadway shows</span>, and go shopping as well.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> So, you like the city life?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I do like the city life. It's very convenient. It's energetic. There's lots to do, and New York City is <span class=""audionotes"">really diverse</span> so it's fun to see the different communities and different people and tourists walking around.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> So if I was visiting New York, what should I do?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> It depends on which season went to visit, so I don't know if you went during the spring or summer time, I would suggest that you spend some time in Central Park. Go see sports. A lot of sporting events during the summer and there are a lot of events also in Central Park. There's outdoor theater and music concerts and stuff  but if you went maybe in the wintertime, you should go see all the windows on <span class=""audionotes"">Fifth Avenue</span> that are decorated with very holiday themed decorations and Rockefeller Center  is know for their big Christmas tree, and you just get a really fun feeling in New York City. Everyone's a little bit more nicer, and I don't know, I like all the seasons in New York City so it depends on which season you decide to visit.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Ah, sounds great, so there's a lot of things to do in New York.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Yeah.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mari: </strong>Hey, Mike, how's it going?     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Good! How are you?</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I'm alright. So you're from Florida right?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, actually, I went to college in Florida.</p>          <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Why did you choose Florida?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Well, the weather is similar to Hawaii, where I'm from, and I also got a <span class=""audionotes"">scholarship</span> to play soccer.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Oh, wow, so you play soccer.</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah, I played midfield for my college for four years.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Wow, you must be really good.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> I don't know about that.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Where was your university?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> It was in the Tampa Bay area, right on the bay, on Tampa Bay, and it's surrounded by the city of Tampa and Clearwater.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> So what is there to do in Tampa Bay?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>There's a lot of things. You can go fishing, boating, sailing, or kayaking. We used to do all of that when I was there.</p>     <p><strong>Mari: </strong>Wow, sounds like a really great city.</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, it was really fun if you like the outdoors type of thing.</p>     <p><strong>Mari</strong>: Do you think it's the best city in Florida?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, I think it's a good location. It's right in the middle of Florida so you can go to Miami. It's a few hours away drive, or to Orlando, that has Disneyworld.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Wow. Sounds like a really great place. Can you tell me about the weather?</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>The weather's really nice in Florida most of the year, which is one reason why I went from Hawaii but in the summer time it gets really hot and when it gets hot you  really need air-conditioning, but that's not problem.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Does it rain?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Actually in the summertime, there's really bad lighting storms. It's always... It lasts for about <span class=""audionotes"">half an hour</span> but it's always between three and five o'clock in the evening.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Sounds pretty scary?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, but when you're inside it's OK. It's kind of cool to watch.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Is there something you don't like about Florida?</p>     <p><strong>Mike:</strong> The only thing I don't like is the bugs. There's so many <span class=""audionotes"">bugs</span>, especially during summer time. And really scary ants, and bugs you can't even see and they <span class=""audionotes"">end up</span> biting you.</p>     <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Wow. Sounds pretty scary.</p>     <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yeah, but as long as you have bug <span class=""audionotes"">repellant</span> when you go outside in the summer, there's no problem.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd</strong>: So for the Satay you can have beef, chicken, liver, mutton. Now, people might not know what mutton is. What is mutton?     <p><strong>Ivan: </strong>Mutton is a lamb&rsquo;s meat. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Lamb&rsquo;s meat. Or sheep&rsquo;s meat.</p>          <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Sheep&rsquo;s meat, yeah. And it&rsquo;s&hellip; well actually, <span class=""audionotes"">personally</span> that is the meat that I most like.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Oh really, that&rsquo;s your favorite?</p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Yeah it&rsquo;s my favorite. It tastes like different and just&hellip; if I find a juicy one and it&rsquo;s <span class=""audionotes"">my wonder of the world</span> maybe. It&rsquo;s really hard to find it anywhere else outside of Indonesia maybe because <span class=""audionotes"">lack of lambs</span>? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, maybe.</p>     <p><strong>Ivan: </strong>So once I find one I really <span class=""audionotes"">cherish that moment</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Now in your city, is it common for people to eat in street stalls?</p>     <p><strong>Ivan: </strong>Yes, we have lots of hawkers in Jakarta. I mean, you can find meat ball sellers, you can find any street smoking vender shops and then you can find any&hellip; yeah, you can eat Nasi Goreng or Mi Goreng in the road also. Like maybe, well usually, when there&rsquo;s a traffic jam <span class=""audionotes"">going on</span>, usually when you can find some hawkers you can just &ldquo;Hey, I want Nasi Goreng&rdquo;, they just go get and give it to us and you can eat.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> From your car, you call to the people and they bring you the food?</p>     <p><strong>Ivan: </strong>Yeah, yeah they bring you the food. Or maybe sometimes we just park in anywhere and then if you see a hawker that sells Nasi Goreng you can just order and you can eat in there.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow, that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>     <p><strong>Ivan: </strong>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s  anywhere, basically, you can eat anywhere.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> I think I would gain a lot of weight.</p>     <p><strong>Ivan: </strong>Yeah, so&hellip;</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd: </strong>Ivan, we are talking about your country, Indonesia. Can you recommend three Indonesian foods for people that visit your country?     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Ooh, that can be a difficult question because we have lots of variety of foods and <span class=""audionotes"">it depends on your taste</span>. I mean, if you like sweet foods we have a <span class=""audionotes"">specialty</span> for that and if you like spicy food also there&rsquo;s a specialty for that, salty, anything, anything you want. But usually people go for&hellip; OK, first is Nasi Goreng. Nasi Goreng is a fried rice and I think it&rsquo;s quite popular  anywhere else in the world if it goes for&hellip; if you want to promote Indonesian food. Yeah&hellip;</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> It&rsquo;s called Nasi Goreng?</p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Nasi Goreng, yeah. Nasi is rice, goreng is fry. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really?</p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> So it&rsquo;s fried rice.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Nasi Goreng.</p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> And then next one is Mi Goreng. Mi goreng is noodles. It&rsquo;s fried noodles, Mi and goreng. Mi is noodles and goreng is fry, yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, so Mi Goreng and Nasi Goreng. </p>     <p><strong>Ivan: </strong>Yeah, and last one is maybe Satay.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, I think we call it Satay.</p>     <p><strong>Ivan: </strong>Yeah, Satay, yeah.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> But you say it differently. </p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Yeah, Satay.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>You say it Satay also?</p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Yeah, Satay. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, and that&rsquo;s mainly chicken on a stick right?</p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Chicken, you can <span class=""audionotes"">go for</span> chicken, you can go for meat, you can go for mutton, anything, liver, anything. And we usually have some kind of special sauce, or ketchup or whatever, like mixed with some <span class=""audionotes"">weird stuff</span> but&hellip; <span class=""audionotes"">basically</span> it&rsquo;s ketchup, chili, and salt and some ginger or whatever. Sometimes it&rsquo;s garlic and you just dip it inside and you eat it and it&rsquo;s really nice. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh that <span class=""audionotes"">sounds really good</span>.</p>               "
"                      <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, Ivan, can I ask you about Indonesia? </p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Yes, sure. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, Indonesia has many islands. </p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Yes. </p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, what island is your favorite in Indonesia? </p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Well, I think maybe most Indonesians will say that it&rsquo;s Bali, but <span class=""audionotes"">as for myself</span> I think that, yeah I think the most favorite one is the island where I was born, Bangka Island because, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s just that it is a nice feeling if you&rsquo;ve been to the place where you were born and then you just get the feeling that&hellip; you, I mean like, <span class=""style5"">you get to know</span> <span class=""audionotes"">the real you</span>. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. </p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Yeah, and that&rsquo;s the most important thing that I have. And recently I went there after, like, 15 years and then, really, I felt that kind of thing. I felt that this is <span class=""audionotes"">my roots</span> of myself and even though I stayed in Jakarta for the past 12 years or so but really being there is really my home. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, you went home for the first time in 15 years? </p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Yes, that&rsquo;s true. The last time I went there was like, well it&rsquo;s not 15 years, but actually the last time I went there&rsquo;s like <span class=""audionotes"">in &rsquo;95</span> so it&rsquo;s like 12 years. </p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That&rsquo;s a long time ago. </p>     <p><strong>Ivan:</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s a really long time ago. But you know what, I have a driver over there and then when I went there in the last holiday I came to see him. And it&rsquo;s just so nice to see&hellip; well, he&rsquo;s getting older of course, he&rsquo;s really old like 70 years or so but he still remembers me and how do I behave when I was a child and all. Like, I was hard to eat something and he had to take me around to make me finish my food. He still remembers <span class=""audionotes"">the small things</span> and it&rsquo;s really giving me, like, a recall to my past and get to know who I am, who I was when I was small, so... </p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd: </strong>So, Rebecca, we're talking about shopping. Is there anything you don't like about shopping?     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yes, I don't like shopping when they're crowds of people. Usually when the sales are on, it can be a good time to shop because there's sales but it also <span class=""audionotes"">draws a lot people</span> and everybody's pushing and trying to get the clothes they want that are on special. Yeah, I don't like that.</p>          <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. Right. Actually, the thing I really don't like about shopping is having - or clothes shopping - is having to try on clothes. You know, like, you go and you find your size and then you put it on and then it doesn't fit, then you have to try it on again and it's just, <span class=""audionotes"">it takes forever</span>. And you look at the numbers and it's so hard to find the number that fits you.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yeah, it seems every year the numbers are changing sizes. You wear a size ten and then the next year it's not that size so. Yeah. That can be a real problem, too.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong><span class=""audionotes"">It drives me nuts</span>. Now in Australia, when you go shopping in the store, do you normally get a lot of personal customer service?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yes. Yes. They tend to come up to you as soon as you come into the store, and if you say you're browsing then <span class=""audionotes"">they leave you alone</span> but it can be really good, the shops I shop at. They do help you with the fitting sizes and when you're in the change rooms, you can just say, No, I need a new size and they will go and get it for you, </p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Yeah, in the States I think the service is really good as well, but what's really annoying is that now they always want to have you join some club or some membership.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">The points cards</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, so you just want to buy your shirt and they ask you, Would you like a credit card? or Would you like a discount card or membership? <span class=""style6"">I can't stand it</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yeah, I know. I think I have so many cards in my wallet, and they're like, Oh, are you a member? and I pull out all my cards and I'm not a member so they <span class=""audionotes"">join me up</span>.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. Right. Usually these days I just say no, but it's just so annoying.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yeah, it can be. Yes.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Rebecca, talking about shopping, is shopping something you enjoy doing?     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yes, when I'm <span class=""audionotes"">in the mood</span> for it. Definitely.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So I guess when you talk about shopping, we talk about clothes shopping, mainly right, so how often do you go clothes shopping?</p>          <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Not very often. Maybe once every three months. It depends on my money. If I have the money.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Do you usually follow the fashions? <span class=""audionotes"">Try to stay hip</span>, and you know?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> No, because sometimes the fashions aren't comfortable. I prefer comfortable clothing.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So are you <span class=""audionotes"">a bargain shopper</span>?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong><span class=""audionotes"">I try to be</span> but if there is something that I really, really like, I will save up and buy it.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> For example what is something you saved up to buy?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I saved up to buy a really nice black jacket and I've had that now for two years so it was definitely a good purchase.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> And you bought this in Australia?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yeah, it wasn't during the sale, so.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So how much did it cost?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I think it was about two hundred dollars, three hundred dollars. Yeah, so it was quite expensive for me.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow, that is a lot.</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Mm.</p>     <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Have you ever bought any clothes online?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> No, I haven't but my friends have and my friends have bought shoes and dresses and tops and, yeah, they really love shopping online.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, they have no problems? Everything is OK?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Everything is OK. They haven't had any problems at all.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So how come you don't shop online?</p>     <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I think I prefer the contact with sales people and seeing dresses and clothes and trying them on. <span class=""audionotes"">You never know if</span> they're going to fit or not.</p>     <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. Right.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Aiste:</strong> Hello, Christophe. So what is summer like in Belgium?<p><strong>Christophe:</strong> Well, at first I would like to answer you that summer is much more better than wintertime in Belgium because there is more sunshine, and the days are longer so there is more sunlight during the day, but actually we also have a lot of rain during summer in Belgium, so people are really upset about it, and I think many people also feel really bad about that because there is rain again.</p> <p><strong>Aiste:</strong> Oh, it sounds like it's raining all year long in Belgium. Which season is actually the nicest one?</p> <p><strong>Christophe:</strong> Well, it's true. Belgium is not a country that you should visit because of the weather because the weather is not really that nice in Belgium.</p> <p><strong>Aiste:</strong> So what is actually there to be visited? </p> <p><strong>Christophe:</strong> In summer, it's actually nice to visit Belgium because there are a lot of music festivals. We <span class=""audionotes"">even</span> have one of the biggest and most famous music festivals in the world, where a lot of famous artists come to sing and a lot of people visit the festival, like over 50,000 people on one day. It's really huge.</p> <p><strong>Aiste:</strong> Do you often go to that festival?</p> <p><strong>Christophe:</strong> I went to that festival when I was younger, but right now I stopped going there. It's too crowded for me. Too many people. <span class=""audionotes"">Once</span> you get older, then you don't like that anymore. You like to go to more quiet places and smaller festivals. What about you? How is summer like in Lithuania? Is it as cold as in wintertime?</p> <p><strong>Aiste:</strong> Oh, no, it is not very cold. Actually in summer we have plus 30, so it means from winter there's almost 60 degrees change to summer. Further, people are very happy because after the winter and after <span class=""audionotes"">a very dark period</span> when sun comes out, they feel like the can take just a holiday and everybody has to stop working. Everybody's really happy with the sun getting out of the sky, and it is very popular, especially in July and August. The people take holiday and go to the seaside and spend their time with their families together <span class=""audionotes"">while</span> swimming and enjoying the sun at the beach, and I really like summer. I think Lithuania looks wonderful in summer, and anybody who goes to Lithuania should visit it only in summer because <span class=""audionotes"">otherwise</span> you'll won't bring a very good impression out of it.</p> <p> </p>               "
"                  <strong>Christophe:</strong> Hi, Aiste.<p><strong>Aiste:</strong> Hello, Christophe.</p> <p><strong>Christophe:</strong> So, how is Lithuania in like in wintertime? </p> <p><strong>Aiste: </strong>Oh, LIthuania is very cold in the wintertime. Usually we have snow from the beginning of November till the beginning of April. That means almost five months of snow, but the good thing about snow is that after <span class=""audionotes"">miserable</span> autumn, where it rains every day, and when the snow starts falling, you have white the atmosphere everywhere, and when people walk in snow, they're not that unhappy and not that desperate anymore, so I actually like snow because snow keeps your <span class=""audionotes"">mood</span> up. What about Belgium in wintertime? </p> <p><strong>Christophe:</strong> Belgium in wintertime is really miserable. It's raining all the time, almost every day rain, rain, rain. It's so miserable that people just look at the pavement when they are walking outside all the time. They look like they're so depressed. There's only <span class=""audionotes"">one thing in their heads</span>, Oh, I hope it will be spring time soon. But, I was wondering, if it's snowing in Lithuania, isn't it cold?</p> <p><strong>Aiste:</strong> Oh, it is very cold. Just a few years ago we had a temperature that reached minus 26 in wintertime. It was really freezing. You almost can't get out of your house. Once you get out, your eyelashes get frozen, and when you get inside, you're just naturally crying because the ice is melting and running all through your face.</p> <p><strong>Christophe:</strong> How do you heat your houses when it's so cold?</p> <p><strong>Aiste:</strong> Well, when it's so cold, it's really a problem to heat your house at <span class=""audionotes"">the proper temperature</span>, and it definitely costs a lot of money. So far I don't have my house and I live with my parents, so my father was taking care of that. He was combining three heating parts with two different kinds of wood and also natural gas from central heating system and by combining this three parts of heating system, he was heating up the house, but still when it was minus 26, once the pipes were frozen, and it was really a huge problem to make the system running back again.</p> <p><strong>Christophe:</strong> Wow, that sounds like a really complicated and expensive heating system. I prefer rain in my country then.</p> <p> </p>               "
"<strong>Mike:</strong> Now Mark, you study, or you do Aikido. Is that right?<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Yeah, I started studying Aikido when I was about 15 years old.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> And what got you interested in Aikido?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> Well, I saw a demonstration at a church one time and I immediately <span class=""audionotes"">fell in love</span> with it, and it <span class=""audionotes"">works out</span> great because I&#39;m not that big of a guy and Aikido is a kind of martial art where small people can throw big people.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Do you get a lot of chances to throw big people?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> Well, not recently, but definitely when I was practicing, when I was studying, it would be interesting because some big guys would come into the class and they wanted to show that they were very tough, and, but usually they were the easiest to throw.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Because they have the extra weight?</p><p><strong>Mark:</strong> Well, yeah, because they attacked and they, in their lives, they&#39;re so used to using lots of strength, so their attack would be very hard and in Aikido, <span class=""audionotes"">the harder you attack, the easier it is to throw</span>.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Now, what interests you, or what do you like the most about Aikido?</p><p><strong>Mark: </strong>Well, I guess at first, like any martial art, I just like the idea of I can <span class=""audionotes"">defend</span> myself if someone attacks me, but later, I just really enjoyed the exercise of it, and you learn some really cool techniques that, how to take someone <span class=""audionotes"">off balance</span> or to throw them and it&#39;s really easy after you study it for awhile.</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Interesting. Thanks.</p><p></p>"
"<strong>Todd:</strong> So, Marion, do you like to play sports?<p><strong>Marion:</strong> I don&#39;t play sports at the moment cause I don&#39;t really have the time, or it feels like I don&#39;t have time. It&#39;s been a long time since I did sports regularly.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, me too, but I love sports. I love to watch sports on TV.</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> Mm-hm. But that&#39;s not really taking part in sports is it? It&#39;s not the same. That just means that you like TV.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> No, I don&#39;t like TV. I like watching sports on TV. There&#39;s a big difference.</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> OK, so, what kind of sports do you like watching on TV?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, I think you know, baseball.</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> But of course. Anything else?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> No anything, pretty much basketball, baseball. I watch anything but there are sports I really dislike.</p><p><strong>Marion: </strong>Hmm, like what, for example?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Ice-skating. I hate ice-skating. It&#39;s <span class=""audionotes"">torture</span>. Like I can&#39;t watch...</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> The girls doing their pirouettes and stuff like that?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, yeah, plus.</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> Figure skating, is that what you mean?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, yeah, so when you watch it you think, they&#39;re gonna fall, they&#39;re gonna fall, and they&#39;ve got the music on in the <span class=""audionotes"">background</span>, and they&#39;re going around really fast, and then maybe you like one of the skaters, and then you&#39;re nervous cause you think, she&#39;s gonna fall, or he&#39;s gonna fall. I mean they&#39;re terrific athletes, but to me that&#39;s not a sport, that&#39;s an art. It should be like dancing or ballet. Like they don&#39;t put ballet on the sports network, so they should not put ice-skating on the sports network either.</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> OK, <span class=""audionotes"">I see</span> where you&#39;re coming from, but I think if you watch a race like say the 100 meters, or something like that, you might also be nervous and afraid that one of them is going to fall, if you have that kind of <span class=""audionotes"">investment</span> in somebody.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, I don&#39;t think so, and I mean maybe it&#39;s just me but, yeah!</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> If you&#39;ve got and American runner, which you usually do, in the 100 meters, do you not feel really nervous for them?</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> No, cause I know they&#39;re gonna win. No just kidding! Actually, they haven&#39;t been winning recently, but, yeah, I guess a little bit, maybe the hurdles. You fell that way about the hurdles, a little bit.</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> Yeah!</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, but do you like watching ice-skating?</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> Um, I don&#39;t mind, but I do find it a bit boring after awhile, really.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah! Yeah!</p><p><strong>Marion:</strong> I find, to be honest I find most sports boring to watch after a certain length of time. An hour and a half is about my limit. I like watching soccer, but soccer is always changing so, I don&#39;t find that <span class=""audionotes"">a chore</span> to watch but everything else really, an hour and a half and I&#39;m done.</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, I guess that&#39;s better.</p><p></p>"
"                  <strong>Doron:</strong> I'm a bit <span class=""audionotes"">schizophrenic</span> when it comes to dates actually cause ... I'll either do something really boring and cheesy like pizza and a movie.<p><strong>Melissa:</strong> That's not boring.</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> Really?</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> Well, it's traditional then. I'll say traditional.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> It could be fun but if you're already at the point where the girl's like in your house ordering pizza and a movie that's ...</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> Well, I was talking about eating out and going to the cinema. You already got the guy back to your house. Very forward.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Well, pizza and a movie sounds like pizza delivery and video rentals, so I see what you mean. I could always go out for a pizza.</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> I like doing that but then on the other hand, I also like to do something totally strange and different, like when I was living in Berlin in Germany a couple of years ago, I met a girl I liked and I invited her out for a date, and she surprised me by saying yes, so I had to find something to do and I was bored of movies and pizza so we went to a restaurant near my apartment, but the restaurant was really, really cool because it was totally, totally black. There were no lights.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Wow!</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> You just go in there and order from a menu in the foyer and then you get taken to a table by a blind waiter and you can't see anything.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">No way!</span></p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> I think they're quite famous. There's two or three around the world. One in New York I think, and also in London and it was the craziest experience because you just have to talk, and I think that's really cool because you don't look at the person. You don't care if they're cute or whatever. You just really get to know them.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> That's cool. Were there lot's of people there?</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> It was packed. You had to make a reservation. It was really, really packed.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> How could you find your way to the restroom?</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> You had to ask. You had to ring a little bell and then a blind waiter would come and take you.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> What do you mean a blind waiter?</p> <p><strong>Doron: </strong>All of the waiters and the waitresses, and the waiting staff, they were all blind or <span class=""audionotes"">partially sighted</span>.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Oh, really.</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> Not the chefs. I think the chefs could see.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Oh, OK.</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> But the staff there, they were partially sighted.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Oh, that's interesting.</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> So they learned the room really well because they could see and they were your guides. It was a really interesting date, just ...</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> It's interesting just from the <span class=""audionotes"">view point</span> of experiencing what it would be like to be blind because I think people don't get to experience that enough.</p> <p><strong>Doron:</strong> Exactly, and to know that maybe when you see someone blind in the street, you think, ah, poor guy, poor girl, but then all of a sudden, they're the ones that know their way around and you <span class=""audionotes"">rely on</span> them.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Yeah, that's really cool.</p> <p> </p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Melissa, the Super Bowl is coming up. And what do you think about football?<p><strong>Melissa:</strong> I think it's really interesting. This Japanese guy recently told me it was the most interesting sport to watch because of <span class=""audionotes"">the rules</span>, but unfortunately I don't really know the rules so I have a <span class=""audionotes"">hard time following</span> it.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> But you're American. You don't like American football?</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> I'm more of a basketball fan cause when I watch it, I can easily understand <span class=""audionotes"">what's going on</span>, and when I'm watching football, everyone around me just screams and they don't really tell me what's going on.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right. But the Super Bowl - that's like the biggest game of the year right! So you go to Super Bowl parties, right?</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Yeah, my sister's <span class=""audionotes"">crazy about</span> football and she has Super Bowl parties but I haven't really lived in America for the past three years, and before that I was in college and I never really went to one. How about you? </p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, yeah, I'm huge .... it's the biggest day of the year for me.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> What's your favorite team?</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, my team is terrible now ... the 49ers, so they're never, ever in the Super Bowl.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Yeah, that's cool. San Francisco.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> But the thing I think is great about Super Bowl Sunday is it's really ... it's like the silent American holiday.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You know what I mean? Like it's the one day where everybody gets together and watches the game and has a good time.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Well, I'm from Philadelphia and Philadelphia fans of all sports are totally wild and crazy, and they just go all out, so a lot of my family members and friends go crazy about the Eagles' games.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So have you ever been to a professional game?</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> I haven't. I haven't been to a professional football game.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, what about college? Did you have a big college team?</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> No, I don't think so. We had a good basketball team at the University of Arizona - The Wildcats, but ....</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, right.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Football, I don't really recall having a good football team.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So when you watch the Super Bowl, usually the best part is the commercials, right? So, they have the commercials, so you watch those, don't you?</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> To be honest, I can't remember watching the Super Bowl in recent years.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow!</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Here it is. I'm saying it's the biggest day of the year, and you don't remember ever seeing it?</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> I mean, I remember watching it, but they're just ... I remember like <span class=""audionotes"">being more into</span> the food that was all around me.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, right. Fair enough.</p> <p><strong>Melissa:</strong> Sorry. But if you invite me this year I'll come.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, cool.</p> <p> </p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd: </strong>So, Greg, I know that you travel a lot, so what do you do with your dog when you travel? Who takes care of your dog?<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Well, we have very good friends who love to have him. In fact, sometimes my friends offer before we go. They know we're going, Hey, can we take care of Dancer? and they take good care of him.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, have you ever actually traveled with your dog?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Actually, yes. Well, when we travel in Japan, he travels with us almost everywhere we go. He sits in the car and sometimes we camp and sleep in the car with him or we stay in tents and he travels with us ... but we've also traveled overseas with him.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, wow, that's cool, so you've actually ... you've taken your dog on like long trips on the plane?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Yes. We moved from Japan to the United Arab Emirates and he came with us there. We lived there for awhile.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow. You took your dog to the Emirates?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Yes, and also we traveled into Oman. In fact we did some serious mountain climbing in Oman with him.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So like, how do you take a dog when you travel? What do you got to do?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Well, depending on the country, you have to check into the requirements. He needs a lot of <span class=""audionotes"">vaccinations</span>. Make sure he's doesn't ... he has to be checked by a vet to make sure he doesn't have any illnesses.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really? Like how long does that take? I mean, do you have to take him to the vet and do this like a month before, or is it something you just do right before you travel?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Probably a couple of weeks at least is average.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, how do you take a dog on a plane?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Well, not every airplane company will allow dogs so you have to check into which do allow them and then you have to have a special nice size container and you have to put a little bit of food in them and you make sure that the airline company tells everybody who's working along ... like if there are any stops on a stopover, they have to make sure everybody knows that there's a dog and then they'll take care ... make sure to check the water and make sure the temperature controls in the back of the plane are at the right <span class=""audionotes"">setting</span>.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> When you get off the plane, is your dog kind of <span class=""audionotes"">freaked out</span>? Is Dancer all stressed?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> He is so happy to get off. He hates flying.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So when he sees the cage, does he <span class=""audionotes"">act funny</span>? Does he act, you know, like with dread, fear?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> He looks at me with his eyes and he tries to <span class=""audionotes"">talk me out of it</span>.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Does he ever succeed?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> He succeeds in a lot of things, but if I have to move, I've gotta move and we're a family so he comes with me.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Hey, Greg, you got a great dog. Where did you get your dog?<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Actually, my dog and I sort of found each other. I was moving from one house to another and as I was moving from the parking lot to my house, I saw this really skinny dog that looked like he really needed food and also affection. I petted him. He followed me back and forth. The next day, he was out in front of the gate to the house. The next day, he made it inside the house to the genkan, the area we leave our shoes. The next day, he made it to the top of the bed.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow. So wait a minute. You're saying that you didn't choose your dog. Your dog kind of chose you.</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Yes. It was <span class=""audionotes"">fate</span>. Destiny.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, what's cool about your dog?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Well, basically my dog is the world's greatest dog. I'm very <span class=""audionotes"">unbiased</span>. He understands English and Japanese and French. He almost never barks. He likes lots of people. He's very intelligent, sensitive human being ... ah, dog!</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So your dog speaks three languages?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> He doesn't speak them, but he understands them.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, can your dog do any special tricks?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> Actually, like I didn't teach him to do any tricks, but he's amazing, like I walk him for ... I can walk for miles with him. He's always by my side and I don't need a leash. No leash whatsoever. He listens to me. He stops when I tell him to stop. If I tell him to go quickly, he runs quickly.</p> <p><strong>Dog:</strong> Wow! Sounds like a pretty good dog. ... So could you live without your dog? Is your dog invaluable?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> My dog is invaluable. Actually, he's getting old now. He's thirteen years old now and I know that some day he will <span class=""audionotes"">pass away</span>, and when I think of that it makes me really, really sad. I <span class=""audionotes"">dread it</span>.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, that would be pretty tough. ... but in the future, you know, maybe after your dog is passed away, would you get another dog?</p> <p><strong>Greg:</strong> I think it would take me many years probably to recover from the loss of Dancer. His name is Dancer.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Well, actually speaking of sports, actually when I was inThailand they played a sport I think you have in Indonesia called takaw - sepak tekaw - I think.<p><strong>Santi:</strong> Oh, yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Have you ever seen that?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> I tried it once in university and it's quite great I think.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, actually, you know, recently I was watching the Olympics and I was thinking that should be an Olympic sport. I mean, I didn't see it in the Olympics. Maybe it is, but ... because people from South East Asia are so good at it and you need to have like that type of body ... very, you know, kind of light, and <span class=""audionotes"">lean</span> and very <span class=""audionotes"">flexible</span>. But for people that aren't <span class=""audionotes"">familiar with</span> the game, can you explain what it is?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> The ball is made from rattan and then you have to be kind of like athletic and have special talents to catch the ball with every part of your body and then you have to have <span class=""audionotes"">self-conscious</span> of where the balls gonna go because once like it goes fast and just times oh my god go directly into you so have to catch the ball maybe with your head or maybe with your hands or even with your chest.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Its amazing ... an amazing sport. Actually, speaking of individual sports, what about golf. That's the <span class=""audionotes"">ultimate individual sport</span>.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> I want to do it but actually the equipment is pretty expensive and I don't know much about it.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now in your country, in Indonesia, are they many golf courses?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes, they have. We have an international tournament actually in Bali. It's very good place to play golf.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh, really. In Bali?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So you can surf in the day, or in the morning,</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> and at night you have ... kind of like relax and enjoy a message and spa.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow.

It's true.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, what kind of sports do you like to play?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong>I like swimming and I like doing yoga. I like sports that involve like individual, not the group kind of sports.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>You don't like team sports?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Really?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong>Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>That's interesting. So why? What is it about team sports you don't like?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Well, actually, when you play individually you can <span class=""audionotes"">compete with yourself</span>. It's much better for me.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, so like if you're swimming, you can increase your time.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong>Yes. That's true.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> What about yoga?</p> <p><strong>Santi: </strong>I yoga just for relaxing and just release my stress.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> See, I love team sports, you know, there's something about team sports. It's so fun. Like you have <span class=""audionotes"">camaraderie</span>. You have friendship, you know, like you share the <span class=""audionotes"">thrill of victory</span> or you share, you know, when you lose, the pain of the loss. I just love that. When you do something individually, you just don't have that.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong>Yes, sometimes, it's true ... your opinion about that, but in my opinion, I think when I do sports, I'm very competitive, so if I get into a group, that is full of my friends, sometimes when we got lost, sometimes I feel angry.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You want to put the blame on your friends?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Sometimes I put the blame on mine, if it is my fault, but sometimes, yeah, it's just like not going so well at the end.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>Right. That's true. That is true. I kind of see your point.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> And I feel <span class=""audionotes"">disappointed</span> in them sometimes, so I'm not very good at teamwork when doing sports.</p>               "

And especially for dinner we have a <span class=""audionotes"">special arrangement</span> in the table, like seven ... well, seven is a lucky number so seven types of dishes and then we got like money from our <span class=""audionotes"">elders</span>.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: You get money?</p>                 <p><strong>Santi</strong>: Yes, we get money but we don't get presents. We get money.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: So when you get this money, what do you normally do with it? Like do they give you money and are you supposed to, like buy gifts, or are you supposed to put it away for savings?</p>                 <p><strong>Santi</strong>: I think they want us to just save the money in case like <span class=""audionotes"">for rainy days</span> and then ... but most of my cousins just spend it for buying things like clothes, bags, shoes, but in my family it's kind of different, so whenever I get money I just give it to my mother.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: For your mom to keep for herself or for your mom to save for you?</p>                 <p><strong>Santi</strong>: I don't know. I'm not very good at money so it's better for me to just give it to my mother and she will <span class=""audionotes"">allocate</span> it.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: Well, actually, I think that's also a Chinese tradional also in the United States where I think that Chinese families, isn't it custom for children actually to give their parents a portion of their money?</p>                 <p><strong>Santi</strong>: Yes</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: Which is actually, I think makes a lot of sense.</p>                 <p><strong>Santi</strong>: Well, because we trust our mother. We trust our parents beyond reason sometimes and I think it's good.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: So always give a little money up?</p>                 <p><strong>Santi</strong>: Yes.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: I agree. I agree. Although I hope my mom's not listening. She's gonna <span class=""audionotes"">expect</span> some money from me.</p>                 <p><strong>Santi</strong>: And I feel better whenever my mom just gives me money to spend it ... not my ... just my entire money and then I spend it. I feel awful.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: Oh, cause you feel like you've contributed some as well.</p>                 <p><strong>Santi</strong>: Yes.</p>                 <p><strong>Todd</strong>: Good point.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Santi, now you are from Indonesia but you actually are Christian, correct?<p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> And now most people in Indonesia are Muslim.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes, that's true.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, so are there any other major religions in Indonesia?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Oh, we have about six religions, actually: Muslim, Christians. We have two types of Christians: Catholic and Christians, and then we have Buddhists and Hindus and Confuciuos.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So you are Christian?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So do you have a ... do you celebrate Christmas specially, like Indonesian style?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> In my family - no - but maybe other families do.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So what do you normally do for Christmas?</p> <p><strong>Santi: </strong>We go to ... well, as a part of family, we go to the church together and then we celebrate ... well, going out for dinner, and then <span class=""audionotes"">that's all</span>.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's it?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, it's <span class=""audionotes"">not that big of a deal</span>?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> No Christmas tree?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> No giving presents?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> No. Even for Christmas tree, my mom always tells that if you want to decorate the tree, you have to - well - clean it up later, so we just like ... yeah, maybe later on.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You don't want to do it.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> No.<strong>Todd:</strong> Wow. OK, that's interesting. So Christmas is very basic and simple?</p> <p><strong>Santi: </strong>Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, actually that's kind of nice. I think a lot of people from other Christian countries would probably prefer that Christmas was that way.</p> <p><strong>Santi: </strong>Really? Well, as a children I expect a present actually from my parents but they don't give me so ... it's OK.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, were you <span class=""audionotes"">bummed</span> when you didn't get a present?</p> <p><strong>Santi: </strong>Yes, sometimes. Well, looking for other friends that they got presents, like, a bunch of presents from their parents or their uncles but, well, me and my sister just don't so ...</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well, that's OK, though. I mean I think maybe that's even better because maybe that <span class=""audionotes"">teaches children a lesson</span>, you know. So does that mean you never get presents or gifts or money or anything?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> No, but we have a special celebration for Chinese New Year because we are raised a Chinese family, so we got presents in Chinese New Year's.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, you celebrate Chinese New Year more than you do Christmas?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes, that's true.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Dai:</strong> So Darren, it’s not long now until Christmas, are you looking forward to it?<p><strong>Darren:</strong> Yes and no. I do like Christmas, the spirit of Christmas, I believe it does bring people closer together, but the thing I find year upon year is becoming more and more tiresome for me is the pressure put on people, especially families with young children, to spend lots and lots of money. I think the true meaning of Christmas is lessening year upon year. </p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Right. What is the true meaning of Christmas then?</p> <p><strong>Darren:</strong> Well I think it like I said it’s families getting together and people showing kindness to one another. I think that should happen all the time mind, but I think at Christmas people do get together and you see people and you wish them a Merry Christmas and it’s a really lovely atmosphere to be in over a couple of weeks over the whole Christmas period. That is what I really do enjoy about Christmas, but as I said I think it’s becoming too <span class=""audionotes"">commercialized</span>--too much pressure to buy <span class=""audionotes"">the latest toy</span>. There always seems to be the in-toy to have and I think people who could afford it: great, but I think a lot of the families really struggle at Christmas and they’re probably in debt for the next twelve months until the next Christmas. </p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Wow, it sounds like it would put a lot of pressure on families.</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>Yeah, I think it does. That’s in general, but especially at Christmas I really do feel for some of the families who obviously are struggling with finances. I’d like that to not detract from what Christmas is really about which is a great time and we have got a fairly big family and we do do a lot of visiting and we have great times at Christmas and we probably do too much on the food and drink.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Food and drink: like what kind ... you know, what are your favorite bits about the food and drink?</p> <p><strong>Darren:</strong> I always love Christmas dinner. The turkey is always cooked to perfection and wherever we go the cooking is usually absolutely <span class=""audionotes"">spot on</span>. No matter how much we eat of Christmas dinner, there’s always room left for a bit of Christmas pudding as well. </p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Christmas pudding?</p> <p><strong>Darren:</strong> Yeah, it’s a very rich, fruit-based pudding which you can usually have with either brandy sauce, which is the only time of the year you ever eat brandy sauce, or with something like cream or custard. </p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Oh, OK. And what does it taste like then? </p> <p><strong>Darren:</strong> It’s very, very rich. It’s one of those things where you either love it or you hate it. I think I’m the only one in my family who eats Christmas pudding, which is great news for me because it means I’ve got it all to myself, but I do suffer for it afterwards--very, very <span class=""audionotes"">bloated</span> and flake out on to the settee and one eye on the television and the other eye sleeping. </p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>OK, yeah, it sound like a good time then. </p>               "
"                  <strong>Dai:</strong> So Christmas is coming around the corner. How do you feel about that?<p><strong>Sharron:</strong> I love Christmas. I love the time with the family, the time off work to relax and enjoy each other's company and just time at home with everyone.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> So, what do you .... what's like a traditional Christmas for you then?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Well, <span class=""audionotes"">the build-up</span> is a bit of a <span class=""audionotes"">nuisance</span> really. It's a lot of money, but it's good fun and it's great. The end result, Christmas morning, watching everybody opening the presents that I've bought and things, but, yeah, a traditional Christmas would be rushing around Christmas Eve getting all the last minute things. Probably up till very late, wrapping presents, and then up early Christmas morning, opening presents, a family visit to see our daughter opening her presents as well, and then it's normally shared around some of the family. We do a different Christmas dinner every year. Either we ...</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Christmas dinner? What kind of ... ?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Right! Christmas dinner back home is a big roast turkey and all the trimmings: stuffing, vegetables ... </p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Stuffing?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Stuffing. It's like herbs and bread crumbs and onions and things. All made up and you stuff it under the skin of the turkey and when the turkey roasts it cooks in there as well. It's really, really tasty. So we have sort of a family meal and one year we'll go to one of the parent's houses or they'll come to us. We just change it round every year. And then normally, it's sort of a lazy afternoon after we've eaten far too much, and watching some of the traditional British television: The Queen's speech at 3 o'clock every Christmas Day.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> So the Queen gives a speech?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Yeah. Tells everybody how her year has been and what she thinks Britain has achieved in the last twelve months and how she thinks things are going to go for the next twelve months and it's on for about twenty minutes I suppose. Not everybody watches it. Sometimes people, after their large lunch, have fallen asleep in the chair by the time it's on the TV, so ...</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Right.</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> But Christmas night then, it's normally cold turkey sandwiches, pickled onions, crisps.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Crisps? Like ...</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Like ...</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Potato chips?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Potato chips, yeah, sorry, potato chips, yeah. We call them crisps back home so ...</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> OK.</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Sit in front of the TV again. It's just a generally family time.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Sounds pretty lazy.</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> It is. Very lazy. Boxing Day then is ...</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Boxing Day?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Yeah, now Boxing Day is the day after Christmas Day.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> So the 26th?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> The 26th of December. Saint Steven's Day, but we have another day's holiday then so ...</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Why is it called Boxing Day?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">I haven't got a clue</span>. Not a clue.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Think it's cause everyone gets rids of their boxes?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Could be. After all the Christmas gifts, yeah. But we generally have a busier day the next day. There's a lot of sport activities going on where we live. In Temby, which is a local seaside town, they have a big Boxing Day swim, which is <span class=""audionotes"">unheard of</span> in the winter. Nobody goes in the sea much in the summer, where we live.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Right, it must be really cold.</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Very cold.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>Like, what would that be in degrees?</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Oh, I don't know, but people dress up and run in the sea for charity. People give donations for money and it's all in <span class=""audionotes"">a good cause</span> and it's a bit of fun. But there's also football matches and rugby matches and things.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> So you generally have a good time.</p> <p><strong>Sharron:</strong> Yeah, most people go out on Boxing Day. It's a more active day than Christmas Day. Christmas Day is the day where most people tend to stay in and be with the family and Boxing Day we will go out and meet up with friends generally.</p>               "
"<strong>Mari:</strong> Hi, Ron. I met your brother Michael and I learned that you&#39;re a triplet. So what is it like being a triplet?<p><strong>Ron:</strong> Yes, I am a triplet. It&#39;s a good thing. I&#39;m very close with my brothers, both of them. One of my brother&#39;s name is Michael and the other&#39;s name is Patrick and all three of us are equally close with each other.</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> That&#39;s good. Did you guys play the same sports growing up?</p><p><strong>Ron:</strong> We all played the same sports growing up, however as we got older we started concentrating on our own sports, so me and Patrick played football - American football - and Michael started focusing more on soccer, but from the beginning, we all played the same sports together.</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> Do you guys dress the same?</p><p><strong>Ron:</strong> We are very similar in how we think so we do wear each other&#39;s clothes and so we do dress alike.</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> Have you ever walked out wearing similar shirts or the same outfit?</p><p><strong>Ron:</strong> Yes, we have and for the most part we try to wear the same colors if we&#39;re together going out.</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> Did you get in trouble growing up all of you?</p><p><strong>Ron:</strong> I think for the most part we were good kids growing up and the good thing about being very close to your brothers is that you never wanted to dissapoint your brothers or make them think bad of you, so you always tried to be a good kid.</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> What&#39;s cool about being a triplet?</p><p><strong>Ron: </strong>I would say the coolest thing about being a triplet is just having people that are very close to you all the time. We never really had trouble making friends or when I to a new school, I always had a friend with me because my brothers were always with me. It was never ... I was never alone.</p><p><strong>Mari:</strong> That&#39;s pretty cool. Was there anything not cool about being a triplet?</p><p><strong>Ron:</strong> Well, growing up the attention is not so cool sometimes. It gets kinds of old and the questions about being a triplet gets kind of old, but for the most part it&#39;s good.</p>"
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, Santi, we're talking about family this week and you have a sister, correct? <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes, a sister.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Now, what's kind of unique about your sister is you both are similar in age and you go to university together, correct?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes, only two years younger than me.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So, yeah, you are 22?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Twenty-two.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> She's twenty.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> What's it like going to university with your sister?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> It's kind of like difficult because I have to take care of her, but it's also fun because you can share things with her.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, what do you mean, like, you have to take care of her?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Well, I'm in my fourth year right now, so I'm kind of like ... not busy, so whatever she wants to have for dinner, I have to cook.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Really, you cook for her?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes. Yes, she's my sister. I'm a good sister.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's very nice. So what kind of things to you cook for your sister?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Basically Chinese food or lunch packets for her, for like tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You make your sister a lunch to take to school?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That's like a mother.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes. </p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow. That's care and devotion.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Well, I said before I'm a good sister.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow. I guess so. Now when you first went to university, did you think your sister would join you - would go to the same university?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> No. I don't think so because, well, she's very good at chemistry and she's also good at science, so I'm hoping that she will go a different directions than me, but, well, I don't know, maybe my mother trusts me, and then my mother led her to me.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> What about similarities and differences? How would you say you and your sister are similar?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> My voice and her voice. It's totally the same.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Really?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So if your sister was here doing audio work, I wouldn't be able to tell who was who.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes. It's true.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wow.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Sometimes we like to <span class=""audionotes"">play with people</span> on the phone. It's kind of like bad but whenever her friends call, I will pretend that I was her.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Really.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> And vice-versa.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> That is a funny joke. So what is something that's different? Like how are you different? Obviously she's good in science.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yeah, and, well, the appearance is different. She has darker skin, and then she's very slim.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You are very slim, too.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Thank you.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Are you the same height?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> No. I'm taller. </p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK. So you really are the big sister.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes, that's true.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> You <span class=""audionotes"">look down on</span> her.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes. Sometimes.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So do you guys fight very much, or do you usually <span class=""audionotes"">get along</span>?</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Uh, during my childhood - yes - but now - no - we just ... well, <span class=""audionotes"">we know the limits</span>. We know that we are ready beginning to be adults, so I don't think that fight is kind of like popular anymore.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right, so you guys are like <span class=""audionotes"">two peas in a pod</span>.</p> <p><strong>Santi:</strong> Yes.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Dai: </strong>So, I really don't see it. What's the <span class=""audionotes"">allure</span> of fishing. I mean, why ... <span class=""audionotes"">what's the catch</span> as it were?<p><strong>Darren: </strong>Well, I can understand that. It's something that looks as if it's not very interesting but it's that thrill and expectancy of just waiting and you can wait for hours and hours and catch nothing, but once that rod starts moving and you know you've got a fish on, especially for the bass that I fish for, there're very, very powerful fish and they can just take the rod and knock it off the rod stand and you're running off at the beach after your rod, which would mean you got a decent fish and the thrill of that moment is just .... it's hard to explain and the only way that you'll ever understand it is to actually <span class=""audionotes"">have a go yourself</span>. It's like everything. It doesn't suit everybody, but I think a lot more people would fish if they actually had a go and experienced catching a fish.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>Is it a popular sport back home?</p> <p><strong>Darren:</strong> It's the most popular sport in the U.K. as far as participants are concerned, but it's not very well publicized. It's much more football, rugby, cricket, golf.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>I guess it's not really a spectator sport.</p> <p><strong>Darren:</strong> No. Although they do actually show some of the fishing events now because of the prize money being so much. It's probably about 25,000 pound for first prize, so it's quite a serious business now and they do actually show that on the television.</p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Yeah, I mean, really, I mean, I'm sure a lot of people would find it - almost equate it to hunting in a way. I mean, how do you feel about that?</p> <p><strong>Darren:</strong> I can understand that view, but I think they need to look at the way fisherman act. As I have said, I only keep fish that I would eat. People who fish the rivers would always put their fish back cause they don't eat the course fish, and that's the way I would see it. It's going back hundreds of years to when people used to hunt.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>And that doesn't hurt the fish .... putting it back?</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>As long as you do it quickly, there's never any harm. You can see the fish swimming away and there's no harm done.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>So, you said that it's the most popular sport in Britain. Is that as new thing or has it always been that way? Do you think it will carry on being popular in the future? Cause it doesn't have a really .. kind of ... sexy image, does it, fishing?</p> <p><strong>Darren:</strong> No, it doesn't, but there is a major campaign to get youngsters into fishing. It is a very laid back sport. You know, it's not a violent sport <span class=""audionotes"">by any means</span>, and I think the future is good for fishing, more so though in the rivers, the sea fishing. Unfortunately, the sea stocks are <span class=""audionotes"">dwindling</span> quite drastically with the trawlers and there's a lot of concern that the fish numbers in the sea are going down so I think sea fishing may become something that's done by fewer people and a lot more people would move in and do river fishing because the stocks there are a lot greater.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>You've almost <span class=""audionotes"">sold me</span>. So, OK, next time I'll come down to Pembrokeshire and you can take me fishing. What should I bring with me?</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>Well, I'd have enough kit for you to keep you going, but it's one of those things. Have a go at it. See what you like. See if you like it, sorry. If you don't, you don't. You just walk away and find something else, but I think, the majority of people who try it, would <span class=""audionotes"">get hooked</span>.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>Nice.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Dai: </strong>So Darren, you’re from southwest Wales. <p><strong>Darren: </strong>Yeah, I’m from a place called Pembrookshire.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>OK and what can you do down there for fun.</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>Well, most of what I do is, in my spare time, is in some way connected to sport. The last five or six years I've started fishing again.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>Fishing?</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>Yeah, I know it’s got a bit of a dull image but I fished a lot when I was younger. I <span class=""audionotes"">gave it up</span> for about twenty years and someone <span class=""audionotes"">got me back into</span> it about six years ago and I really do enjoy it again. </p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>What is it that, you know, <span class=""audionotes"">draws you into</span> fishing, I mean ...? </p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>Well, it’s quite unusual. We don’t fish as most people imagine where you sit by a riverbank and don’t move. The fishing I do is at night time. The fish come in a lot closer and I fish off the beach. Because they come in closer at night time, it’s the best time to go. So it’s quite <span class=""audionotes"">exhilarating</span> just being out there. You haven’t got to catch fish to enjoy it.</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>Right.</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>It’s great being under the stars and hearing the waves crash in. It’s just a beautiful place to be even if you don’t catch a fish...which is good news really because I don’t catch fish very often. </p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>Yeah, so if I wanted to have a go at fishing, what would I have to do? What kind of equipment would I have to get?</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>Well I was amazed when I re-started how cheap it was. It was probably cheaper twenty years after I finished than it was when I packed it [<em>in]</em>. For about sixty pound you could go down to the local tackle shop and they’re very, very helpful. They’d kit you out. </p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>Oh really?</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>And you could start, but what I would advise is that you would find someone who did know what they were doing, just to <span class=""audionotes"">show you the ropes</span> really. But I was amazed how quickly I got back into it after so long away. </p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>And what kind of fish are you catching?</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>There’s loads of fish around the Pembrookshire coast. You know, absolutely loads of varieties, but we do target a fish called bass which I know there’s a lot of varieties around the world, but it’s a great eating fish. </p> <p><strong>Dai:</strong> Oh, so you eat the fish you catch normally? </p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>Yeah, I would only take a fish from the sea if I was going to eat it. If I wasn’t going to eat it, I would put it back...</p> <p><strong>Dai: </strong>o.k.</p> <p><strong>Darren: </strong>But the bass is a beautiful eating fish, quite expensive to buy in a restaurant so it’s a lot better to catch them yourself. <br /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>               "
"                  <strong>Shirley:</strong> David, so earlier, I was telling you I've always wanted to go to Africa and I'm just wondering, is that whole safari scene the <span class=""audionotes"">cliche</span>...<p><strong>David:</strong> It's not a cliche, but it's something real you have to experience when you get there on the safari. What you see on National Geographic and this ... you know .. documentaries is true. It's nothing ... it's not anything that ... they wouldn't show you that's not true that you'll find in Kenya.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> Wow! So I could be just out there ... what driving around in my car and on my own just seeing all those animals?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> No, you don't get to drive in your own car. They provide services for you like ... we have like for instance in Kenya we have an institute called KWS: Kenya Wildlife Service that does that and it has its own warders that are highly trained to protect you when you're in the forest.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> OK, so the tourists are kind of <span class=""audionotes"">regulated</span>?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> Yeah, sort of.</p> <p>Shirley: All right. So what could I expect to see if I go out?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> You can expect to see the wildlife itself: animals in their own habitat, some sleeping, some walking, some hunting. You never know. It depends on the time when you're doing your safari.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> Am I gonna get chased by a rhinoceros?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> No, they actually don't chase you cause, you know, most of the time you're just passing by. You're not disturbing them, but at times you get into contact with animals. You know, animals live in <span class=""audionotes"">packs</span>, so when one animal is excommunicated from its pack, it's an angry animal. For instance, buffalo, so when you find one buffalo by itself, that's not a really nice thing.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> So, what would happen if I found a buffalo by itself?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> That's what we call a charged buffalo. It's really angry. It's been excommunicated from it's pack and it cannot join the other pack so it attacks at anything, you see, sometimes they are really dangerous and that's why you need the game warders who carry like ammunitions just to protect the tourists.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> Wow! Really! So what's the chance of me getting attacked by a wild animal?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">One in a million</span>. But you never know. You can never <span class=""audionotes"">rule these things out</span>.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> So it doesn't happen very often?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> It doesn't happen very often but at times in the past it's happened.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Shirley:</strong> Hi, David. How are you?<p><strong>David:</strong> I'm fine, thank you, Shirley.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> So, environmental issues ... we were talking about them earlier throughout the world, and you're from Kenya.</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> Yes, I'm from Kenya.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> So, what's happening over there?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> One of the environmental issues we are having is deforestation, which is really affecting both the wild animals and people living around the forest and, you know, the environment in general.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> So, what's actually happening to the people that ... for example the people who actually live around the forest area?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> Cause you know, when you tend to interfere and come in between the wild animal's habitat and things like that, you somehow create like an imbalance in between the people and the animals and sometimes it's not a really nice thing cause animals tend to come close to where people live instead of living in their own habitat, which is a really bad thing.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> So, are they like attacking people .... or?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> They really don't attack but it's not a really nice picture or scene to know that you're <span class=""audionotes"">vulnerable</span> at anytime.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> What about livestock of the people that are close to forest areas?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> You know, that's one of the things that are in danger cause, you know, if wild animals come to where people live, and they have livestock, probably they'll want to be eaten.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> So, what's actually causing the deforestation?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> People are trying to burn charcoal, so that they can get, they're trying to burn the trees so that they can get charcoal and sell cause as you know everyone is not living to <span class=""audionotes"">the living standard</span> that they're supposed to be living, and they're trying in every way to earn <span class=""audionotes"">an extra dime</span> to <span class=""audionotes"">support their families</span>, so they turn to deforestation and the cutting down of trees, and this has been one of major causes of deforestation cause when you're trying to get charcoal and sell, you have to cut a tree and that results to deforestation and other causes that come along with deforestation and like soil erosion: things like that.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> So what's being done to try and remedy this, or to try and counterbalance the effect?</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> The activist groups that are coming together like ... you all know the Nobel Prize winner Wangari Maathai.</p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>David:</strong> She has her own green belt movement in Kenya. She's been for so long trying to <span class=""audionotes"">discourage</span> people and educate people in what deforestation does to the country and how it effects people and the environment in general.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mari:</strong> Hi, I'm Mari, I'm here with Ron. Today, we're going to debate about if it's better to sit in the front of the class or in the back of the class, so I'm going to start. I always sat <span class=""audionotes"">front-row-and-center</span> in all of my classes all throughout my education, and I think that it's a lot better to sit in the front of the class because teachers and professors know your name. I feel like the teacher is always looking at me so I stay focused, so I think that's why I sat in the front of the class or I think it's important to sit in the front of the class.<p><strong>Ron:</strong> Well, Mari, I believe that it's not necessarily better to sit in the front of the class because all students aredifferent. Some students will be <span class=""audionotes"">overwhelmed by the pressure</span> of having the teacher stand right in front of them, talking to them, and they'll forget about taking notes or forget about concentrating and only worry about having the pressure of the teacher standing right in front of them, so in that case, it's good for students to sit in the back of the class so that they can relax and make sure that their mind is free so they can learn what the teacher is saying.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> But are you really learning in the back of the class? Are you focused in the back of the class?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Yes, you are focused because you're relaxed and you can make sure that the pressure of not having the teacher in front of you doesn't overwhelm so that you can <span class=""audionotes"">go at your own pace</span>.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> But I don't feel pressure from my professor. I think it's more pressure that I put on myself. But I think that the kids or the students that sit in the back of the class are never really paying attention. They're always just kind of talking amongst themselves.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> And usually, I think they're talking about the subject of the class, so that is even... that's another strong point about sitting in the back of the class. You don't have to interrupt the class and you can just ask your friend quietly <span class=""audionotes"">on the side</span> if you're unclear about something.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I think it's better to sit n the front of the class because I think you're able to <span class=""audionotes"">develop a relationship</span> with a teacher. If I look confused maybe they'll re-explain something or it's a lot easier for me ask questions. I think that maybe teachers think that if sit in the back of the class, they don't really like you.... like the teacher.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> That may be true sometimes, but in my experience it was a lot more comfortable for me to sit in the back of the class with my friends and we could feed off each other, and we could ask each other questions to make sure that we understand the subject, so I think sometimes in class it's more important that you be comfortable than it is to be uncomfortable, but try to impress the teacher.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I see your point, but I disagree.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Ron:</strong> Hi, I'm Ron from Hawaii. I'm here with Mari from Japan. Today we're going to be talking about entertainment, and how often we do these things. So Mari, how often do you watch TV?<p><strong>Mari:</strong> I watch the news in the morning and when I come home at night I sometimes watch TV.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Do you have a favorite TV show?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I don't have a favorite TV show.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> OK. How often do you go to the movies?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I really like going to the movies. I think I go maybe once a month or maybe once every two months.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> And other than that do you rent movies?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> No, I don't rent movies but sometimes I download movies. I like to watch comedies - <span class=""audionotes"">romantic comedies</span> - and a little bit of drama.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> What is your favorite movie you've watch <span class=""audionotes"">recently</span>?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> My favorite movie... I don't know if it was my favorite movie, but a movie that I watched recently is called 27 Dresses. It is about a girl, or a woman, who is a <span class=""audionotes"">bridesmaid</span> twenty-seven times.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> And that's a romantic comedy?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> It is.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Interesting. What about reading? Do you like to read books?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I do like to read books. Right now, I'm really busy with work so I don't have a lot of time to read but when I'm on vacation or whenever I have free time, I like to read books.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> What kind of books?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I like to read <span class=""audionotes"">non-fiction</span> usually. <span class=""audionotes"">Biographies</span> of people, and I also like to read about like teaching practices so that I can become a better teacher and a little bit of fiction.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> And what about concerts? Do you enjoy going to concerts?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I don't go to music concerts. I don't think I've ever been to one actually but I like to go see musicals and I also like to go to sporting events.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Nice talking with you Mari.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mari:</strong> Hi, this is Mari. I'm here with Ron. Today, we'll talk about types of entertainment and how often we do these things. Let's first start with watching TV. Ron, how often do you watch TV?<p><strong>Ron:</strong> Usually I watch TV every day. I don't watch TV very long but I usually watch TV every day. Usually I watch the news.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">Why just the news?</span></p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I like to know what's going on in the world, so I usually watch CNN or BBC.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> And that's it. Nothing else?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Usually, yes.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Usually?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">Other than that</span>, sometimes I'll watch sporting events such as baseball or football.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> But that's it?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> OK, next, do you go to the movies? How often do you go to the movies?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I don't go to the movies very often, maybe twice a year, I would say.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> That's it.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Do you rent movies?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I rent movies more than I go to the cinema, but also not very often.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> What kind of movies do you like?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I like funny movies. Comedies.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Comedies. What's the most recent movie you watched?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I watched Home Alone last night but it was on TV. I didn't rent the movie.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> OK. How often do you read books?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I don't like reading, so I don't read books very often. The only time I do read books is for school <span class=""audionotes"">purposes</span>.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> What kind of books do you read for school?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Well, my <span class=""audionotes"">major</span> is International Relations, so usually I read International Relations books, if I have to read.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> If you have to read. So nothing? No books for pleasure?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Not for entertainment.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> So when you're on the airplane, you don't read?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> No. I try to watch the movies on the airplane.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> OK. How often do you go to concerts?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I go to concerts <span class=""audionotes"">once in awhile</span>. In Hawaii, there aren't many concerts so when they're are concerts, I try to go.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> What do you go see, or what type of concerts?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I like Hawaiian music so I go to Hawaiian concerts, and if a big star from America comes, I usually try to go also.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> So music concerts.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Right, music concerts.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> OK, Ron, thanks.</p> <p><strong>Ron: </strong>You're welcome.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Ron:</strong> Hi, I'm Ron from Hawaii. I'm here with Mari from Japan. Today we will be talking about abilities. So, Mari, are you a good cook?<p><strong>Mari:</strong> I like to cook, <span class=""audionotes"">more specifically</span>, I like to cook for people. I like to have people over and eat with people. I don't really like to eat alone, so I don't like to cook for myself. I like to cook for other people, but more than cooking I like to bake.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Baking. What do you like to bake?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Cookies and brownies and cake.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> That sounds very good. I would like to eat one of your brownies. OK, next, are you a good singer?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I am terrible at singing. I don't like going to karaoke and I don't like to sing. I like music, but <span class=""audionotes"">I can't sing for my life</span>. I, yesterday, or I guess in class it was a students birthday and I made my students sing Happy Birthday but they wouldn't start so I had to start them off singing and my voice was so bad, they started laughing at me, so I'm just a terrible singer.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> That's funny. OK, next. Are you a good dancer?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> No, I'm not a good dancer. I can't dance at all. I used to when I was younger, my parents would <span class=""audionotes"">enroll</span> me in ballet classes, so I did ballet for six years but I am not very good at dancing.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> So, you're a teacher now right? So, were you a good student when you were a student?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I was a good student because <span class=""audionotes"">I'm a dork</span>. No, yeah, I think I was a good student. I tried hard in all of my classes. I always did my homework. I was always focused and took notes during class. If I didn't understand something, I would either ask questions in class or speak to the teacher or professor after class. I always really liked learning and so I think that's why I was a really good student.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> And athletics? Were you a good athlete, and are you a good athlete now?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">That's a tricky question</span>. I like sports, and I like playing sports. I don't think I'm a very good athlete, probably compared to you, I'm probably not, but I really enjoy playing sports. In high school, I played soccer. I ran cross-country. I played ice-hockey and a little bit of lacrosse.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> And which one was your favorite sport?</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> My favorite sport was ice-hockey.</p> <p><strong>Ron: </strong>Interesting.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mari:</strong> I'm Mari from Japan and I'm here with Ron from Hawaii. Today we are going to be talking about abilities so let's start with food. Can you cook?<p><strong>Ron: </strong>I can't cook well, but I do cook, so I think the reason why I can't cook well is because I can eat anything, so I don't try very hard to make it take good.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> What do you like to cook?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I like to barbecue outside <span class=""audionotes"">on the grill</span>.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> What do you put on your barbecue?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> When I cook meat, I don't put much, only salt, pepper, and a little bit of seasoning.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> OK. Good. Next, do you think you're a good dancer?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> No, I don't think I'm a good dancer and I don't really try to be a good dancer.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Do you not like to dance?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> No, I don't like to dance.</p> <p><strong>Mari: </strong><span class=""audionotes"">At all?</span></p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Right.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> I heard that you're a good <span class=""audionotes"">line dancer</span>.</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I would like to learn how to line dance, and I do like country music but I haven't been <span class=""audionotes"">officially</span> taught how to line dance.</p> <p><strong>Mari</strong>: So you don't dance at all?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Next, are you a good singer?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> No, I'm not a good singer but I do enjoy going to Karaoke.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> What do you like to sing?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> In Hawaii, when I go to Karaoke I enjoy singing Hawaiian music. If I'm in Japan I like to sing other English songs that they have, usually country music or 80's or 90's music.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Good. That's good. Do you think you're a good student?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I don't know if I'm a good student. Growing up I was not a good student but now I am trying harder to be a good student.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> How were you not a good student growing up?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I didn't enjoy going to school and I didn't try very hard in school. Now I try a little harder. I make an effort. </p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Can you talk more about your effort? What do you do to try to be a good student?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I try to listen to the teachers now instead of <span class=""audionotes"">doing my own thing</span>, and I try to complete everything with good quality.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> That's good. And, last do you think that you're a good athlete?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> Growing up I was a good athlete. I played a few sports. Now I don't play any sports anymore because I'm old, but growing up I think I was a good athlete.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> What sports did you play?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I played American football, baseball, and soccer.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> Which one is your best sport?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I would say football. American football is my best sport.</p> <p><strong>Mari: </strong>How long did you play?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I played since I was eleven until age twenty-two.</p> <p><strong>Mari:</strong> So for eleven years. And you played when you were in university?</p> <p><strong>Ron:</strong> I played at the University of Hawaii.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, I am here with Tarta and we are talking about the tsunami in Thailand and she helped people after the event. Can you talk about what it was like the few days after the tsunami hit?<p><strong>Tarta:</strong> Yes, right away from like from the tsunami hit, I went on the 28th, so two days after tsunami hit, so everything is like damaged and, you know all waters are all over the place. There's car on top of the buildings too, like the second floor of the buildings and rotten bodies like everywhere ...</p> <p><strong>Todd</strong>: Wow, dead bodies.</p> <p><strong>Tarta:</strong> Dead bodies like really everywhere, and because that time there were not many volunteers yet ... so if we just walk through the place that we just want to find a live person to give a food or to help but then we just hit by the dead body, like without knowing because it is a huge body and you can't recognize who is that person because, you know, all the faces are just getting, I just don't want to say it but ... but it really was ...</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> And you actually helped?</p> <p><strong>Tarta:</strong> I helped because I was there so early for two days and then I helped to the volunteer who helped to <span class=""audionotes"">picking up</span> the dead body so I ... whenever I find a dead body so I called the person and then we helped to pick up the dead body into the <span class=""audionotes"">pick-up car</span> and then send it to the temple. To ... for, what do you call the ...</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> The identification?</p> <p><strong>Tarta:</strong> Yeah, identification at the temple. So, because they have some base over there and <span class=""audionotes"">carry on</span> for almost a week so there are probably, like, 50 organizations who come and help us.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So after this <span class=""audionotes"">horrific event</span> happened, how did it change you? Like, did it give you a different perspective about life or about nature or ... anything?</p> <p><strong>Tarta: </strong>Yeah, I do agree. I think, I mean, nature always have a, what do you call, always fair you know? If you do ... everything have <span class=""audionotes"">cause and effect</span>. So if you do something it is going to give you a return in somehow, in someway, like whenever it's going to happen. So, I believe in karma too, so I think it's a good example that what humans do to the nature and nature give you back. </p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Hello, can you introduce yourself please?<p><strong>Tarta:</strong> Yes. My name is Tarta, I am from Thailand. I live in the southern part, in the east coast.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> So Tarta, you were in Thailand when you had the tsunami?</p> <p><strong>Tarta:</strong> Yes, I was right back from my Laos trip with my family on the way, because we drive car. We go by car to Laos and then on the way back, then we drive back on to the Seven. Then we saw on the news on television that like the tsunami hit on the west coast and first we thought like we watching the documentary, that it is somewhere else, not in Thailand but then suddenly it is getting more serious and then ... it's a really sad story ... and 26 it happened and 27, because living not really far away from Phuket and also I really want to go and help them. But then my Dad <span class=""audionotes"">didn't allow me</span> because they say the 27 it gonna have the aftershock, so we wait until the 28th. And then my uncle, my Dad's friend, he have a small company and he really want to help so brought two vans, with one van full of food, like lunchbox for maybe 300 packs, and then lots of necessary stuff like the medicines or water and all those kinds of stuff. So we drove to Phuket and then tried to, you know, <span class=""audionotes"">distribute</span> all the food as much as we can, even though we have no idea where we are. actually that time there were not many <span class=""audionotes"">volunteers</span> still, so we were following ... follow with the other radio staff, local radio staff who really want to help as well. So we went up into the hills, where the people move up because they are afraid of the <span class=""audionotes"">aftershock</span>. So we went there and then there were, like, our villagers around 210 people who were waiting for food because they ... they were living there without any food or water for two days already. So we went there, like, try to <span class=""audionotes"">provide</span> as much as we can, like all the food that we had and then it was very sad because what you see, it's like nothing from T.V. you know.</p>               "

"                  <strong>Jonathan:</strong> So, Jeff, you know, I don't know if I want go out to the pub again on Saturday. LIke the music is a little bit too loud. It's hard to meet people and so on. I don't know. I've been thinking, we should do like some online dating. You know, try to meet some women that way.<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> What do you mean? We just sit at home and through the computer. Or how do you do that?</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> No, you don't have a date through the computer. That would be awful. But, you know, in the modern world people are <span class=""audionotes"">rushed</span>. They always don't have time to go out and meet people. If you only go to bars, to try to meet people, you're only meeting a small percentage of the population: the people who do like to go out and drink and have fun, and so on. You're <span class=""audionotes"">cutting yourself off</span> from a lot of people.</p> <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So how does this work, this online dating? Do I have to pay to use this site?</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Oh, there are some sites where you pay and some where you don't. You can put up a profile of yourself, you know, with a picture if you like, or perhaps you would like to stay more <span class=""audionotes"">anonymous</span> and not put your picture up. You can see a lot of basic information about people even before you're ever in contact with them.</p> <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>So, if I'm living in a city, do I look for dates or women only in that city?</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Well, most of them have search critereas. You can choose within say twenty kilometers or a hundred kilometers. Anyway where in the world if you like? You don't always find love <span class=""audionotes"">just around the corner</span>. You might find you have a heck of a lot in common with somebody <span class=""audionotes"">on the other side of the world</span>. But with online dating, people put up some information that they are comfortable sharing, so you can see what somebody does in their free time, what somebody's beliefs are, what somebody is interested in finding, so you may find by doing the search that you meet someone that really matches up with you that you would be interested in contacting without ever going out to the bar, or if you just go out and hit the bar, you may feel a one in a million shot to meet the right person, whereas online, maybe you can search a million people and you find that right one.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Online dating. That sounds great. I'm gonna give it a go.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Jonathan:</strong> Jeff, I really don't understand how sometimes you have so much success with girls when we go out to the bar. It often seems like I'm the one sitting there and not really enjoying the conversation with the other girl's friend while you really <span class=""audionotes"">hit it off</span> with these women, and you're able to just walk up and talk to people. I don't know, maybe I just don't have the ability to go up and do that. How do you do that?<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I don't know. That's a... there's no <span class=""audionotes"">special formula</span> I don't think. I think you have to be a little bit open. You've got to be a little bit nice.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Do you <span class=""audionotes"">have some lines</span> that you use?</p> <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I don't think. It all depends on the situation. It depends of the girl and the place and how you're feeling and what the girl looks like, but I think it helps a lot to have a good wingman. You need a good wingman. If you're by yourself you look a little bit strange: Why is this guy here in the bar by himself, so you need <span class=""audionotes"">a good wingman</span>.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Well, I find when I go out to the bar with you, you've been able to meet and talk to some people, yeah, I guess maybe when I go out alone I don't have quite the same success rate, but then a lot of times, you go out to the bar by yourself and you meet people and then I only hear about it afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Yeah, but I think it's... if you drink enough beer and you go out with <span class=""audionotes"">the right mindset</span>. Leave all or your parameter at home and everyone is good in their own way.... and if you're open to everyone, open to having a good time, I think girls can sense that and they like that.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Or perhaps you're just strange enough that it doesn't seem all that different when you're out by yourself.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, it might be that. It might be that.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Jeff: </strong>So, Jonathan, I'd like to meet a nice girl. I'm looking to meet a nice girl but I'm not quite sure where we should go to meet women. What do you think? Where's a good place to meet some women?<p><strong>Jonathan: </strong>You know, <span class=""audionotes"">that's hard to say</span>, I mean, there are all kinds of things that work for other people that they haven't necessarily worked for me. I mean, I talk to people who say that met girls in libraries, but I don't really want to go to a library. Usually they've got <span class=""audionotes"">a silence rule</span>. I don't want to go up and try to talk to a girl and have the librarian say, SHHH!</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Actually, one of my friends told me that he met a girl in the grocery store once in <span class=""audionotes"">one of the aisles</span>. He was looking at milk and she came up beside him, so maybe we should go get some groceries.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> That seems to be a really unnatural kind of way to meet women in a grocery store. Maybe is a woman sees that you're buying individual portions of something and you're buying like little TV dinners that are only put in the microwave oven, she knows that you don't have someone at home cooking for you, but if I go out and I see a woman filling a basket with lots of tomatoes and cucumbers and so on, then I imagine she's probably cooking for a family.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, why don't we go do something like bowling. Bowling! Women love to bowl. I'm sure we can meet some nice ladies at the bowling alley.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Oh, but women don't like putting on those ugly shoes.</p> <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Well, then...</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> It's <span class=""audionotes"">unfashionable</span> when they go to the bowling alleys.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, then, shopping! Let's go shopping. Girls love shopping. We can meet them at a store.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Girls love shopping but then they're gonna make you hold their bags for two hours while they go and try on different things. That's no fun.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> OK.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> How about a concert?</p> <p><strong>Jeff: </strong>Ah, no, Too noisy.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Yeah, I guess you can't talk to women there.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, I think actually, another one of my friends once met a lady at a bank - the bank teller.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Bank teller.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> That would seem like a little bit of a strange thing, and there I think the woman would be <span class=""audionotes"">judging you</span> by how much money you have in your account. She'd be able to see all of your information.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, actually, I think let's just go to the pub.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> OK.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> So, <span class=""audionotes"">going back to before</span> you went in to the army, what made you get so big? Was it just that you were sitting all day? Were you eating hamburgers everyday or what were you doing?<p><strong>Jade:</strong> I don't want to <span class=""audionotes"">blame</span> American culture ... but <span class=""audionotes"">as you said</span>, like pizzas, like especially not Italian pizza but like Pizza Hut, like American pizzas and hamburgers made me really big. And I really liked that ... like coke and stuff and that made me really big. I always liked reading books. Reading books and eating something was my only hobby that I did at my home. I really didn't like to exercise or join the soccer games with my friends. I was just a really quiet person, but in the army I had to change. I had to learn how to fight, I had to learn how to, you know, move my body Everything was for protect our country but besides that, I became more healthy too. I really appreciate that thing.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Yeah, that is a great story actually. So ... but you said that you are healthy now and you've lost all this weight but you used to eat burgers and pizzas. Do you eat them still, sometimes?</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> Sometimes, yeah it's hard but you know, all the temptation of that is always tough but I'm still,you know, I won't <span class=""audionotes"">deny</span> that. I really like burgers or pizzas even now ... </p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh I'm with you man, I like it too!</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> But I am trying to avoid it ... I still now, I prefer water than coke. But I still like, you know, sweet things or something but still now, you know last point, even I have changed a lot but I have to keep that 'til even now, but there is <span class=""audionotes"">no pain, no gain</span> - I got the word from the army ...</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Right</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> And I have to keep this, I wanna ... I like the way I am now and if I wanna keep this, I have to, you know, do many things for me. I have to pay it</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Well you look fantastic. I have only known you the size you are now, so I can't imagine you being 117 kilos so ... I can't wait to see the photos.</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> OK, I'll give you the photos later, you can see it. I'll show you that.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> OK, thanks man.</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> OK, see you later.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Todd:</strong> Hello. I am here with Jade from Korea and we are going to talk about life in the military. So Jade, you were in the army correct?<p><strong>Jade: </strong>Yeah, I was in the army 'til just a year ago.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Ah, so pretty recently.</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah, recently.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>So how did you feel about being in the army. Did you enjoy it?</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah being in the army, I enjoyed it. Maybe some other Koreans will really surprised when I say I really enjoyed the military right? But ... because you know we have to go there for compulsory business and <span class=""audionotes"">compulsory service</span> for two years. Two years is very long but to me it was a very <span class=""audionotes"">significant time</span> and very precious time to me. For saying the truth, I am sort of <span class=""audionotes"">ashamed to say</span> this but I was 117 kilogram before entering the army.</p> <p><strong>Todd: </strong>117! I can't believe that! <span class=""audionotes"">You're tiny</span>. How much do you weigh now?</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> Now I am 68 kilogram.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh my gosh, that's half.</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yes, it's almost half. When I finished the army just a year ago I was almost 62. I gained 6 more kilograms when I finished the army, now I'm... I get a little bit fat, but I'm still 68 kilograms.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Wait a minute, you lost what is that 50 kilograms, 55 kilograms in one year?</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah, in a year, in the army.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> Oh my gosh, 55 kilograms in one year? How did you do it? ... Was it the food, was it the exercise?</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> In the army, every day, about the amount of food we ate it doesn't matter I think I ate more but everyday we ate regularly, like three meals on the exact time and everyday we had to do lots of training(s) like, you know, maybe somebody knows about the martial arts TaeKwonDo, a Korean traditional thing. Everyday we practice that and we ... everyday we practice lots of martial arts and lots of training things for health, so it helps me to lose weight. You know that ??? life is the best way to lose your weight.</p> <p><strong>Todd:</strong> When you came out of the army and you went back home, people must have been shocked?</p> <p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah, everyone was <span class=""audionotes"">shocked</span>, everyone but ... they understood because most of Korean boys when they finish the army, they get changed.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Mike: </strong>Hi, this is Mike from Singapore and I'm talking to Clare from America about obesity and food in <span class=""audionotes"">our respective countries</span>. So Clare, what about America? <span class=""audionotes"">What makes it so infamous</span> for having food that are very, very so called unhealthy?<p><strong>Clare:</strong> Well, in America we were the country that invented the fast food chain, I think. There are very many famous fast food chains that got their start in America and they became popular because Americans were working very long hours in the cities and in small towns and it was a lot easier, it was very new, to have a convenient meal ready for you. Well unfortunately these meals were not prepared in a way that was healthy. There was very little <span class=""audionotes"">veggies</span>, I mean french fries are fried potatoes, burgers are fried, so the way they're cooked it ... they're made quickly but they're not made in a way that's healthy, there's no boiling or steaming so ... because these chains had a very good product being offered in one respect, that they were fast and easy and convenient to get to, while <span class=""audionotes"">on the down side</span> they were very fattening, people sort of just chose what was convenient I think, and there are so many of them because they really are popular. It's sort of a cycle where even though people know it's bad they choose it because it's convenient and because it gets so much business more chains open in a city or along roads because Americans have ... travel very long distances for commuting to get almost anywhere. For example, where I live in Texas, along the road very small towns separated by miles and miles of desert, every small town where highways come together have at least one <span class=""audionotes"">burger joint</span> or ice cream place that serves burgers and fries and so it's a little bit of, I wouldn't call it American culture, its just sort of what we got used to.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Clare:</strong> Hello this is Clare from the United States, I am talking with Mike from Singapore about obesity and diet in our countries. America is famous for well infamous for being one of the fattest countries in the world. Mike you said that in Singapore diet is <span class=""audionotes"">something of an issue</span> as well, can you please explain?<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Right, well we have all the usual burger joints, Pizza Place, all the fast food basically in Singapore are also and because a lot of us are busy working so naturally this food actually seem like a good idea because it saves us a lot of time and if you're working in a city like Singapore, during lunchtime, you don't have time to basically <span class=""audionotes"">queue with everybody</span> for food and stuff ... so, fast food are actually good <span class=""audionotes"">alternative</span> to get your lunch. And on top of that, we have what we call, in Chinese we call it kopitian. What it means is coffee shop in English and these coffee shops they don't serve, they serve coffee also but a lot of it is actually local delicacies, and Singaporean food are famous for being delicious but very, very high in cholesterol.</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Well can you give me an example of a dish?</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> OK, one of the famous dish is actually originated from I think Malaysia or Indonesia. It's called Nasi Lemak. Nasi Lemak is Malay for rice. What this food ... what Nasi Lemak is actually it consists of fish, which is fried fish and fried egg with coconut rice and ...</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> What is coconut rice? I've never heard of that.</p> <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Coconut rice is actually normal rice cooked with, I think, coconut milk, if I'm not wrong and so rice gives off a very, very nice fragrance and we just call it coconut rice. And this coconut rice is, <span class=""audionotes"">as you can imagine</span>, very very <span class=""audionotes"">high in cholesterol</span> and ...</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Right, and sugar too</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Right. So Nasi Lemak is one fine example. Another example is probably char kway teow. Char Kway Teow is actually a Tawainese word for fried noodles. So this char kway teow is basically Chinese rice noodles with some fish cakes and with a lot of chilly and bean sprouts and they use a lot of ... I think it's black sauce, Chinese black sauce. Actually I'm not really sure what's <span class=""audionotes"">the American equivalent</span>. So, just like Nasi Lemat previously, this char kway teow is also very, very high in ...</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> In cholesterol.</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Right.</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Although it sounds really, really good. I ate before coming here but I'm hungry again!</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> And I think most of the delicious food are high in cholesterol.</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Because frying makes everything taste better.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Brian:</strong> Hey Fanny. <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Hey, Brian.</p> <p><strong>Brian:</strong> How's it going?</p> <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Not bad.</p> <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Alright, so we're asking each other questions about our countries, and last question that I asked was when is the best time to visit? but I have another question to ask <span class=""audionotes"">if you don't mind</span>.</p> <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Yeah, sure go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Brian:</strong> <span class=""audionotes"">As you might have noticed</span> I'm not Chinese, and I don't speak any Chinese.</p> <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> OK.</p> <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Is it going to be hard for someone who only speaks English to travel in your country?</p> <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I mean if you go to China and now if you cannot speak Chinese, of course it will be a little bit difficult for you because you know there will be 2008 Olympic games, in Beijing right, 2008 so there are a lot of Chinese people who can speak English right there so I think they can help you.</p> <p><strong>Brian:</strong> See, I don't know if I would be going during the Olympic Games because, like, maybe it's really crowded and really kind of busy. I'm thinking to go like maybe before that when it may be a bit quieter.</p> <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Hmmm ... sorry. I think maybe I made you <span class=""audionotes"">confused</span>, I mean because people are getting ready for the Olympic Games,so people are just, you know, learn English to communicate with foreigners to help them and to guide them ... I mean, what I meant, you can find a lot of people who can speak English there.</p> <p><strong>Brian: </strong>Oh, so <span class=""audionotes"">because of</span> the games many people are learning English ... but I could still ... even if I didn't go during that time, English people are <span class=""audionotes"">still</span> around.</p> <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Right, right exactly. If you go to the shops most people there can already speak English, Japanese or Korean.</p> <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Oh really?</p> <p><strong>Fanny:</strong> Yeah, so ...</p> <p><strong>Brian:</strong> Very talented people in your country.</p> <p><strong>Fanny: </strong>Yeah, we can say that.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Clare:</strong> So did you have a choice about what sort of job you were going to have in the military?<p><strong>Mike:</strong> No we don't. Once you enlist you have to go through a ... what do you call ... a health <span class=""audionotes"">medical check up</span> and you'll be given grade A to F. If you get an F you don't have to serve in the military. And grade A and B you have to, and for grade I think C you have to but you'll be given a <span class=""audionotes"">clerical job</span> mostly.</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Is there ... can you say how exactly the classification works or is it just the medical people who decide this?</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> For example, for a grade C personnel you might have things like a ... what do you call a ligament laxity which means it is easy for you to get <span class=""audionotes"">sprains</span>, ankle sprains or back injuries or stuff like that. And you might have in the past, if you have sweaty palms, that might pass you as grade C because you can't through a grenade but now they don't take that excuse anymore. Another thing is if you're ... if you have a history of asthma attacks ...</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Well I can see why they would not want people who have asthma being a soldier ...</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Right, but if you're obese, that doesn't qualify you for grade C because if you're overweight what they make you to do is spend an extra two months for Basic Military Training </p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Ouch..</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> ... or what we term as BMT, so for the average Private, or actually recruit, you have to do three months for BMT ...</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Ouch ...</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> ... but for obese <span class=""audionotes"">personnel</span> you have to do up to five months ... so the extra two months is a lot of training, especially cardio training.</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Do you know anyone who had to go through five months of BMT?</p> <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Both of my cousins ... and quite a lot of my friends actually, because Singaporean diet is actually ... yeah, I'll just <span class=""audionotes"">leave it as that</span>.</p> <p><strong>Clare:</strong> So I imagine if many Americans had to go through that training program, I know I probably would have to take the five months.</p>               "
"                  <strong>Clare:</strong> Hello this is Clare from the United States and I am talking with Mike from Singapore about serving in the army.  Mike I've heard that in Singapore it is required that all men serve in the army. Is that true?         <p><strong>Mike: </strong>Yes that's true. We have to <span class=""audionotes"">serve</span> in the army for two and a half years if you're a university graduate. And if you ....your highest qualification is high school then you have to do just two years. </p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> So it's better to volunteer right out of high school if you want to serve a very short time in the military.</p>         <p><strong>Mike:</strong> That's right. But, however if you are just out of high school the kind of job you're gonna (going to) get in the army is not going to be very .......good actually because um ..... for officers or for sergeants you have to have, like, at least college education.</p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Oh ok, so you went to the army out of high school or college?</p>         <p><strong>Mike: </strong>College.</p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Ah, so you were an officer?</p>         <p><strong>Mike:</strong> No, I was artillery sergeant .... an' um, I was actually posted to the artillery branch for about one year and then after that when they found out I was a college graduate I had to do um..... Human Resource work for my camp and that took me another one year.</p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Oh, so when you say <span class=""audionotes"">artillery</span> do you mean you were ah ..... doing stuff with canons and big guns .....</p>         <p><strong>Mike:</strong> That's right , actually what we do is a lot of the training is based on how we get the guns ready for the actual um......test firing And then we have to study how to repair the guns <span class=""audionotes"">on site</span> um ..... for about three months or so, and in order to drive the guns you have to have a license which, and that will take about one month.</p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> And is it a common sight to see these trucks driving around Singapore I mean it's a very small island isn't it?</p>         <p><strong>Mike:</strong> That's right. So we do most of our practises in Australia actually or New Zealand for </p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> So you have a military <span class=""audionotes"">partnership</span> with Australia.... </p>         <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Right..</p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> ..and New Zealand...</p>         <p><strong>Mike:</strong> Actually with many other countries in the world. Um....for example, the airforce the partnership is with the United States...</p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Oooh...</p>         <p><strong>Mike:</strong> ..because all the equipment's actually purchased from the United States</p>         <p><strong>Clare:</strong> Yeah, F16's right...</p>         <p><strong>Mike:</strong>.. and then for artillery's training is held in Australia and New Zealand and then for the rest of the other <span class=""audionotes"">infantry</span> exercises it can be United States or Sweden or actually all over Asia, because as you have mentioned Singapore is such a small place so there is not a much space for us to do it.</p>               "

It's just that we don't have any hobbies.""<br />B: ""That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby?""<br />A: ""That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings.""<br />B: ""I like to play the piano for fun.""<br />A: ""Yeah.

Why don't you come out and play with us?""<br />B: ""That sounds great. Give me a call next time you guys play.""<br />"

What do you think we should do?""<br />A: ""For starters, we should start doing more outdoor activities. That way we'll get some exercise.""<br />B: ""I was thinking about taking tennis lessons. I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon. What do you think about that?""<br />A: ""That's not a bad idea. How much is it?""<br />B: ""I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons.""<br />A: ""Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start. Count me in.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What do you do besides work and watching TV?""<br />B: ""When I have some time, I like to exercise.""<br />A: ""Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club?""<br />B: ""I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago.""<br />A: ""How do you exercise?""<br />B: ""I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the cardio, and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes.""<br />A: ""How often do you go?""<br />B: ""I want to go four times a week, but I'm too lazy. Last week, I only went to workout once.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jimmy. Let's go workout later today.""<br />B: ""Sure. What time do you want to go?""<br />A: ""How about at 3:30.""<br />B: ""That sounds good. Today we work on Legs and forearm.""<br />A: ""Hey. I just played basketball earlier, so my legs are a little sore. Let's work out on arms and stomach today.""<br />B: ""I'm on a weekly schedule. You're messing everything up.""<br />A: ""C'mon. We're only switching two days. You can do legs on Friday.""<br />B: ""Aright. I'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Damn Scott. You got big.""<br />B: ""Yeah, I've been working out a lot.""<br />A: ""How long have you been lifting weights?""<br />B: ""For a year and a half.""<br />A: ""Yeah. Last time I saw you, it was like 2 years ago.""<br />B: ""Has it been that long?""<br />A: ""How often do you go to the gym?""<br />B: ""I usually go every other day for about 3 hours.""<br />A: ""That's a lot.""<br />B: ""Yeah, I used to work out for an hour a day 4 times a week, and I saw no results. This is what you have to do to get noticeable results.""<br />A: ""I don't think I have the discipline for that.""<br />B: ""Just think of it as a hobby. Then it's actually fun.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""The weather is terrible.""<br />B: ""Yeah. It's been raining a lot these days.""<br />A: ""I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain.""<br />B: ""Have you heard when it's supposed to get better?""<br />A: ""I saw the weather report, and it's going to rain for the next eight days.""<br />B: ""That sucks so much. What are we going to do?""<br />A: ""I'm getting pretty bored. We should do something despite the rain.""<br />B: ""I'm with you. What do you have in mind?""<br />A: ""I haven't been to the Mall in a long time. Let's go there.""<br />B: ""That sounds good. They have a movie theatre there, so if we get bored, we can watch a movie.""<br />A: ""Great. I'll stop by your place now.""<br />B: ""Ok. Don't forget to bring your umbrella. The rain can start up again anytime.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Did you ever take History 231?""<br />B: ""Yeah. Last semester.""<br />A: ""Who was the professor?""<br />B: ""It was Professor Johnson.""<br />A: ""I have him this semester. What do you think about him?""<br />B: ""He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot, but fortunately, he's an easy grader.""<br />A: ""What did you end up getting?""<br />B: ""I got an A-. Sounds good, but none of my test scores were that high, so I don't know how I got a decent grade.""<br />A: ""That's probably because he grades on a curve.""<br />B: ""Are you enjoying the class so far?""<br />A: ""I hate it and I was about to withdrawal. But after hearing your experience, I think I will tough it out.""<br />B: ""Yes. Definitely stay in the class. You will get a better grade than your test scores. He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot.""<br />A: ""Thanks for letting me know. I feel relieved now.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi Mike. What have you been up to?""<br />B: ""Not much. I started exercising.""<br />A: ""Trying to get in shape?""<br />B: ""Yeah, and I need to start improving my health.""<br />A: ""Me too. What are you doing besides exercising?""<br />B: ""That's about all.""<br />A: ""I think if you eat better, it will help tremendously.""<br />B: ""Sleep is good too. I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems.""<br />A: ""Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy.""<br />B: ""True. But I think it is worth it. When you get old, you want to be healthy and active.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""I haven't seen your father in like 5 years. How is he doing?""<br />B: ""He's not doing too well.""<br />A: ""Why? What's wrong?""<br />B: ""About a year ago, he started feeling weak all the time.""<br />A: ""Is it due to old age or is he sick.""<br />B: ""Maybe a little of both. The doctor's can't point out anything specifically. I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth.""<br />A: ""That makes sense. It's important to take care of your health early in life.""<br />B: ""That's what my father tells me almost everyday.""<br />A: ""Well, I hope he starts feeling better. Say hi to him for me.""<br />B: ""Thanks. I'll let him know.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Stacy. What's going on?""<br />B: ""I'm pretty tired these days.""<br />A: ""Why? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands?""<br />B: ""I have so much house work to do. I have to take care of the kids, cook, clean, laundry, and the cycle never ends.""<br />A: ""How about your husband. Does he help much?""<br />B: ""Not at all. He comes home and complains about his hard day at work. He expects me to do everything. He even wants me to feed him sometimes. Can you believe that?""<br />A: ""That sucks.""<br />B: ""If he wasn't so lazy, I think I wouldn't have any complaints. He mows the lawn, but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it?""<br />A: ""That's crossing the line.""<br />B: ""Oh well. I'll have to live with it. What else can I do?""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Welcome. Can I help you with anything?""<br />B: ""Hi. I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday. Do you have any suggestions?""<br />A: ""Let's see. How about a nice shirt and tie? You can't go wrong there.""<br />B: ""Well. He doesn't wear ties that often.""<br />A: ""We have some nice pants. You can also get him a belt with it.""<br />B: ""That sounds good. Which one do you recommend?""<br />A: ""These slacks are very popular. He can wear them to dress up a little or on a normal casual day.""<br />B: ""I like them. Do you have matching belts?""<br />A: ""Yes. Right over here.""<br />B: ""How much are they?""<br />A: ""The pants are on sale for $40, and the belt is $25.""<br />B: ""What is your return policy just in case he doesn't like them?""<br />A: ""Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you.""<br />B: ""That sounds great. I'll take them.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey John. I have some great news.""<br />B: ""What happened?""<br />A: ""I got a job offer from Dell.""<br />B: ""That's great. I thought you said you didn't get the job.""<br />A: ""I thought I did bad on the interview, but I guess I was wrong. I'm so happy right now.""<br />B: ""I bet. That's great news. I'm very happy for you.""<br />A: ""Thanks. I feel like celebrating. Let's go have a beer. It's on me.""<br />B: ""Sounds good.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Mike, did you win the lottery or something? Why the big smile?""<br />B: ""I'm so relieved. I just passed the bar exam.""<br />A: ""You did? That's great! You must be very happy now?""<br />B: ""That's an understatement. I'm on cloud nine. I couldn't be any happier.""<br />A: ""Did you tell your parents yet?""<br />B: ""Not yet. I didn't get a hold of them. I'll try to call them again tonight.""<br />A: ""They're probably going to be so happy.""<br />B: ""I think so. It's turning out to be a great day.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Life's so boring.""<br />B: ""Well, most of the time it is, I guess.""<br />A: ""What do you think will make you happy?""<br />B: ""I think money will make me happy.""<br />A: ""You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness.""<br />B: ""It will for me. Then I can do all the things I want to do.""<br />A: ""You'll get bored eventually.""<br />B: ""Then I can find something new to do. If I don't have to worry about money, then I don't have to work.""<br />A: ""That's true, I guess. If I didn't have to work, I think I would be happy.""<br />B: ""You see... money doesn't equal happiness, but it takes away a lot of responsibilities.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What happened to your car?""<br />B: ""A tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car.""<br />A: ""Are they going to pay you for the damages?""<br />B: ""They're saying it was already there.""<br />A: ""What the hell. That doesn't make sense. What are you going to do.""<br />B: ""I have to go to court. A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there.""<br />A: ""That sucks. I'd be pissed if that happened to me.""<br />B: ""I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars.""<br />A: ""Oh my gosh. Damn... screw the court, I would burn down their store.""<br />B: ""We'll see what happens after court.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Jack, what's wrong?""<br />B: ""You!""<br />A: ""What are you talking about? What did I do?""<br />B: ""You told Martha that I was on a date? What was that all about?""<br />A: ""No... that's not what I meant. I didn't mean that. She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara. I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends.""<br />B: ""She started feeling suspicious after you said that.""<br />A: ""I'm sorry man. I didn't know. I didn't mean to screw anything up.""<br />B: ""Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend. Now, I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you.""<br />A: ""Look. I really didn't mean to, and next time I see Martha, I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends.""<br />B: ""Don't bother.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow.""<br />B: ""I know. It's going to be so much fun.""<br />A: ""I always get excited the day before.""<br />B: ""I used to be like that. But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore.""<br />A: ""I only go skiing twice a year, so it's a real treat for me.""<br />B: ""That makes sense.""<br />A: ""What things make you excited?""<br />B: ""Whenever I go to Vegas, I get really excited.""<br />A: ""Oh... that makes me excited too!""<br />B: ""Looks like anything fun makes you excited.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jack. Are you excited about starting work?""<br />B: ""Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it.""<br />A: ""What was more exciting, starting college or starting work?""<br />B: ""They're pretty similar, but in different ways. I really can't decide. How about you?""<br />A: ""For me, I think starting school was more exciting.""<br />B: ""Does that mean work isn't that great?""<br />A: ""It's different for everyone, but because I knew school was going to be so much fun, I really got excited about it.""<br />B: ""But work is a huge portion of our lives. I'm looking forward to making it fun.""<br />A: ""That's a great attitude to have. I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce.""<br />B: ""I hope you're right.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""You don't look too well. What's going on?""<br />B: ""I just lost my job. I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills.""<br />A: ""I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been looking for another job?""<br />B: ""I just started, but the job market is very bad right now. I'm not optimistic about it.""<br />A: ""That's tough. What does your wife think about this?""<br />B: ""She's trying to be supportive, but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well.""<br />A: ""I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job. I'll see what they can do.""<br />B: ""I really appreciate your help.""<br />A: ""No problem. In the meantime, don't try to worry so much. You'll get through this.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi Jackie. You don't look too well. What's going on?""<br />B: ""It's nothing. I'm just a little stressed out.""<br />A: ""Why? What's stressing you out?""<br />B: ""School. Since I was working part time, I had a difficult time keeping up with class. Now that we have exams coming up, I'm totally freaking out.""<br />A: ""The best thing to do is study as much as you can. I'm sure you'll do alright.""<br />B: ""I hope so. I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days. That's what it'll take.""<br />A: ""I have to study for an exam too. Why don't we study together. We can encourage each other.""<br />B: ""That will be great.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Mike. What are you doing tonight?""<br />B: ""Nothing planned. How about you?""<br />A: ""Work is kicking my ass. I'm so stressed. Let's go grab a drink.""<br />B: ""I'm always up for a drink. To tell you the truth, it's been quite stressful here too.""<br />A: ""I say we get drunk tonight. I don't want to think about all this stuff.""<br />B: ""But we have to work tomorrow.""<br />A: ""We won't stay out too late. I just need to forget about work.""<br />B: ""I hear ya. Let's do it.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Mike. What are you doing?""<br />B: ""Nothing much. What are you up to?""<br />A: ""I was just concerned about Sam. He hasn't been himself lately.""<br />B: ""He took the civil service exam and failed.""<br />A: ""That sucks. He must feel depressed.""<br />B: ""Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days.""<br />A: ""Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him.""<br />B: ""That's a great idea. Why don't you call him. I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else.""<br />A: ""Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done.""<br />B: ""Sounds good.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hello?""<br />B: ""Hey Tina. What are you doing?""<br />A: ""I was just watching TV. What's going on with you?""<br />B: ""I just watched a movie and I'm scared.""<br />A: ""What did you watch?""<br />B: ""I saw the Sixth Sense. I didn't know it was going to be so scary.""<br />A: ""I remember that. It was a great movie. But it was definitely scary.""<br />B: ""If you're not busy, do you want to come over? I'm afraid to be alone.""<br />A: ""Sure. I can come over. What should we do?""<br />B: ""How about if we watch a comedy. I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense.""<br />A: ""Ok. I'll get ready and leave. I'll see you in about 20 minutes.""<br />B: ""Hurry, ok. It's dark out.""<br />A: ""Don't worry, nothings going to happen. I'll be there real soon.""<br />B: ""Ok. See you soon.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Mark. What are you doing?""<br />B: ""Just watching some TV.""<br />A: ""Anything interesting on?""<br />B: ""Not really. Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN.""<br />A: ""So I take it you're pretty bored too.""<br />B: ""Just killing time until I find something to do. What are you up to?""<br />A: ""It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing. What's wrong with us?""<br />B: ""You wanna shoot some hoops?""<br />A: ""I already tried to call up some of the guys, but they are all busy.""<br />B: ""Where's your girlfriend? I thought you were going out with her today.""<br />A: ""She's out shopping with her friends.""<br />B: ""Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then.""<br />A: ""Aright. Do you have any cigarettes?""<br />B: ""I only have a couple left. Why don't you pick some up on the way.""<br />A: ""Ok. See you there in about 30 minutes.""<br />B: ""Aright. See you there.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Why the long face?""<br />B: ""I'm getting sick of work man. I can't take the political bull in the company any more.""<br />A: ""Did you just get your review or something?""<br />B: ""Yeah, but that's not why I am upset. I just found out another guy got a promotion. He doesn't know how to do anything. He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long.""<br />A: ""That sucks.""<br />B: ""I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies.""<br />A: ""Look on the bright side. At least you have a job.""<br />B: ""Yeah. I shouldn't stress about this anymore. It's not like I can do anything about it.""<br />A: ""Exactly. Instead, we should have some drinks tonight.""<br />B: ""How about a cold bottle of beer.""<br />A: ""Now you're talking.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""How are you doing?""<br />B: ""I'm doing great.""<br />A: ""What movies have you seen lately?""<br />B: ""I saw Forrest Gump the other day.""<br />A: ""What type of movie is that?""<br />B: ""The movie type is drama.""<br />A: ""I can't believe you are watching movies. The weather is great. You should be outside.""<br />B: ""I hate the hot weather. I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner.""<br />A: ""What else do you like to do besides watching movies?""<br />B: ""I like to play computer games, read books, go shopping, and play pool.""<br />A: ""Out of those what is your favorite?""<br />B: ""My favorite is to play computer games.""<br />A: ""What is your favorite computer game?""<br />B: ""My favorite is Diablo. It used to be Star Craft, but it is getting a little old.""<br />A: ""If you like to play so much, when do you ever exercise?""<br />B: ""Although I hate to exercise, I go jogging at least twice a week.""<br />A: ""That's pretty good. By the way, what are you doing next Saturday?""<br />B: ""I am going to go to the bookstore.""<br />A: ""I am having a party Saturday night at my house. If you have time, you should come.""<br />B: ""That sounds like fun.""<br />A: ""Great. I'll see you on Saturday.""<br />B: ""Ok. See you later.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hello?""<br />B: ""Hi Steve. This is Mike. What are you doing?""<br />A: ""Oh, hi. I was just watching TV.""<br />B: ""There's nothing to watch right now.""<br />A: ""I know. I was watching a re-run. I have nothing to do and I was bored.""<br />B: ""Me too. Let's get together and do something.""<br />A: ""I'd like to, but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner. How about tomorrow?""<br />B: ""Yeah. Let's plan something tomorrow.""<br />A: ""Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow?""<br />B: ""I think it is going to be the same as today. Clear and sunny.""<br />A: ""That's great. We can do something outdoors then.""<br />B: ""Are there any special events going on tomorrow?""<br />A: ""Yeah. I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow.""<br />B: ""Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Let's go check it out.""<br />A: ""Do you know what time it starts?""<br />B: ""It starts at one PM.""<br />A: ""Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards, we can head over there.""<br />B: ""Perfect. I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Steve. Is that you?""<br />B: ""Yeah. What's going on?""<br />A: ""Not much. What a surprise to see you here.""<br />B: ""Yeah. It's been a couple of months since I saw you.""<br />A: ""What have you been up to?""<br />B: ""I just started working out.""<br />A: ""Really? Where do you work out at?""<br />B: ""I joined the Samsung Health Club last month.""<br />A: ""What do you mostly do during your workout?""<br />B: ""I concentrate mostly on my legs, chest, arms and stomach.""<br />A: ""I should start exercising more.""<br />B: ""It's hard work while exercising, but it is a great feeling when I get done.""<br />A: ""I have a running machine at home. I used to use it, but I already got sick of it.""<br />B: ""Exercising at home is hard. The environment is not suited for exercising.""<br />A: ""If I want to exercise, I will need to join a gym.""<br />B: ""I have a couple of guest passes. You want to check out my health club.""<br />A: ""That's a good idea. Let's go over the weekend.""<br />B: ""Great. I'll call you Saturday morning.""<br />A: ""Aright. I'll talk to you later.""<br />B: ""Ok. Bye.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi. What's your name?""<br />B: ""My name is Jung Min. What's your name?""<br />A: ""My name is Jessica. It's nice to meet you.""<br />B: ""Yes. It's nice to meet you too. Are you a new student too?""<br />A: ""No. I'm a sophomore. I take it you are a new student?""<br />B: ""Yeah. It's pretty exciting to be here.""<br />A: ""Have fun while it lasts. The excitement wears off real quick. Especially after you see how much homework you get. Where are you from?""<br />B: ""I'm from Korea. My parents wanted me to go to an American university, so I came here.""<br />A: ""I have never been to Korea. I've been to Japan before, but never Korea.""<br />B: ""Why were you in Japan?""<br />A: ""My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country. He's so into learning about different cultures.""<br />B: ""That's pretty cool.""<br />A: ""I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents.""<br />B: ""Well, if you ever want to visit Korea, I would be happy to show you around.""<br />A: ""Thanks for the offer. I'll keep that in mind. Oh, the professor is coming. We'll talk more after class.""<br />B: ""Ok.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey John, did you register for classes yet?""<br />B: ""I register this Friday.""<br />A: ""What classes do you plan on taking?""<br />B: ""I really want to take the communication class, but I don't know if it will be available.""<br />A: ""Is that class really that popular?""<br />B: ""Yeah. I tried to get in last semester, but it was full by the time I registered.""<br />A: ""What other classes are you going to take?""<br />B: ""I still need to take English 201, but I really don't like writing.""<br />A: ""I took that class already. There is a lot of writing, but it's not that bad.""<br />B: ""Oh really? Who was the instructor? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from.""<br />A: ""I had Professor Mahoney.""<br />B: ""Is he an easy grader?""<br />A: ""I'm not sure if he is or not, but I thought he was definitely fair.""<br />B: ""Do you mind if I ask you what you got?""<br />A: ""Not at all. I got a 3.8.""<br />B: ""Well, what did you get in English 101 last year?""<br />A: ""I got a 4.0 in that class.""<br />B: ""Well, I can't compare to you. I got a 3.1 in English 101. That means if you got a lower grade in English 201, it must be harder.""<br />A: ""It's not what it appears. I actually tried harder in the 101 class. If I put as much effort into the 201 class, I would have received the same grade.""<br />B: ""Oh. That helps. Thanks.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Mike. I forgot about registration. I'm a day late, so all the classes are mostly full. What do you think I should do?""<br />B: ""You're screwed. You can't do anything about that. You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful.""<br />A: ""Do you think going to the registration building will help at all.""<br />B: ""No. They will tell you the same thing in a worse way.""<br />A: ""Did you register yet?""<br />B: ""Of course. Registering for classes is not something you want to miss.""<br />A: ""What classes do you think are still open?""<br />B: ""Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, so there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology.""<br />A: ""That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester.""<br />B: ""I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full.""<br />A: ""He does that?""<br />B: ""I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class.""<br />A: ""That makes sense. I think I'll do that. Thanks for all the help.""<br />B: ""No problem man.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Did you get your grades yet?""<br />B: ""Yeah. My whole GPA is screwed up now.""<br />A: ""Why? What happened?""<br />B: ""Well, I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7.""<br />A: ""Ouch. You must be very disappointed.""<br />B: ""Well, it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have.""<br />A: ""Why don't you re-take the class next year?""<br />B: ""That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up. How did you do this semester?""<br />A: ""I didn't do that well either. I ended up with a 3.2 this semester. That drops my total GPA to 3.45.""<br />B: ""My GPA is pretty similar to yours. I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class.""<br />A: ""What was your GPA before this semester?""<br />B: ""I was sitting happy with a 3.4.""<br />A: ""Why did it go down so much?""<br />B: ""Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class.""<br />A: ""What happened to you?""<br />B: ""I started playing StarCraft and ended up wasting a lot of time.""<br />A: ""You better stop slacking off.""<br />B: ""You're right. I'm not going to play games during school anymore.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi Mark.""<br />B: ""Oh, hi Stacy.""<br />A: ""How was your summer vacation?""<br />B: ""I worked over the summer at a restaurant. Have to make tuition money right? What did you do?""<br />A: ""I took summer school. I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up.""<br />B: ""So are you officially a junior now?""<br />A: ""Yeah. And I have 5 credits to spare. I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, but I took 15 because the price was the same.""<br />B: ""That makes sense. So where is Nicole?""<br />A: ""She dropped out of school completely.""<br />B: ""Really? Why?""<br />A: ""She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, they asked her if she wanted to work full time.""<br />B: ""Wow. She's so lucky. She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job.""<br />A: ""It sounds good now, but I'm traditional. I want the degree, so I wouldn't have accepted the offer.""<br />B: ""Do you know how much they are paying her?""<br />A: ""I don't know. But I bet it must have been a good offer, or she wouldn't have accepted it.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Did your wife give birth yet?""<br />B: ""Yeah. She's a healthy beautiful girl.""<br />A: ""Congratulations. How is your wife doing?""<br />B: ""She is tired, but getting a lot of rest now.""<br />A: ""That's good to hear.""<br />B: ""I'm just glad there were no complications.""<br />A: ""If your wife and baby are both happy, what more can you ask for?""<br />B: ""It's been a week, and I haven't slept that well.""<br />A: ""That's normal for anyone with a newborn.""<br />B: ""Yeah, but it's so hard. I have to work, and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby. I'm going to get sick at this rate.""<br />A: ""You'll get used to it. After everything stabilizes, you can regain your health.""<br />B: ""That's true. I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Ahhchooo!""<br />B: ""You've been sneezing a lot lately. Are you sick or something?""<br />A: ""No. Every spring time around April, I'm stricken with allergies.""<br />B: ""I never have seasonal allergies.""<br />A: ""Consider yourself lucky.""<br />B: ""What are all the symptoms?""<br />A: ""Well, as you just saw, I sneeze a lot. Also, my nose becomes very runny, my throat sometimes itches, and my eyes start to water.""<br />B: ""That doesn't sound good.""<br />A: ""No it's not. So you don't have any type of allergies?""<br />B: ""Well, I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol. It runs in the family.""<br />A: ""Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol.""<br />B: ""I get it pretty bad. My whole face turns red, including my ears. My eyes become bloodshot, and I start to itch all over my body.""<br />A: ""That's pretty bad.""<br />B: ""But that doesn't stop me from drinking. Hahaha.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi Barbara. Have you lost weight?""<br />B: ""Hi Julie. Yeah. I've been on a diet for a couple of months now.""<br />A: ""Wow. You look great.""<br />B: ""Thanks for noticing.""<br />A: ""What type of diet were you on?""<br />B: ""I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating. With a combination of eating better and exercising, I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months.""<br />A: ""That's amazing. What tips did your trainer give you?""<br />B: ""Mostly on how to exercise, but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits. Instead of eating 3 times a day, she told me to eat 5 times a day.""<br />A: ""That doesn't make sense. If you eat more, than how do you lose weight?""<br />B: ""Actually, I'm eating the same amount. I eat 5 smaller meals a day. Basically, it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate.""<br />A: ""That makes sense. I'm going to try that.""<br />B: ""You don't need to lose weight.""<br />A: ""I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of.""<br />B: ""Ah... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet.""<br />A: ""Thanks for the advice.""<br />B: ""No problem.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Can you believe her? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet.""<br />B: ""Tell me about it. If I was as small as her, I wouldn't think about going on a diet.""<br />A: ""Me too. But what are we going to do? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight.""<br />B: ""That's because you don't exercise. If you were more active, you wouldn't have a dieting problem.""<br />A: ""What do you know? You are over weight too.""<br />B: ""I'm not on a diet though.""<br />A: ""I know. But I don't have someone to diet with. If we help each other and motivate each other, then I think we can lose some weight.""<br />B: ""I like ice cream too much though.""<br />A: ""C'mon. You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there.""<br />B: ""It does sound appealing.""<br />A: ""It's a great idea. I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier. Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed.""<br />B: ""Okay. I'm in. Let's do it.""<br />A: ""Great. I'll get our plan started right away.""<br />B: ""Can we start tomorrow though?""<br />"
"<br />A: ""You see that chick over there?""<br />B: ""The one in the red shirt?""<br />A: ""Yeah. Isn't she hot?""<br />B: ""She's alright.""<br />A: ""Just alright?!? She's hot!""<br />B: ""Why don't you go talk to her?""<br />A: ""You think she's out of my league?""<br />B: ""Hell no! You're just a chicken that's all.""<br />A: ""C'mon. I get nervous when I talk to girls.""<br />B: ""Why don't you go stand next to her for awhile and if an opportunity comes up, strike a conversation.""<br />A: ""What do I talk about?""<br />B: ""It doesn't matter. You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that.""<br />A: ""I don't know...""<br />B: ""Do you want me to go talk to her?""<br />A: ""No. Stay away from her.""<br />B: ""If you don't do anything, I'll bet somebody else will.""<br />A: ""Ok already. I'll try.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jack. What's going on?""<br />B: ""Hey Matt. I'm going to ask Martha to marry me?""<br />A: ""Really? When did you decide this?""<br />B: ""I always knew she was the one, but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago. I'm just debating on how to do it.""<br />A: ""That's exciting man.""<br />B: ""So how did you propose?""<br />A: ""You shouldn't use my example. It wasn't special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now.""<br />B: ""What do you think I should do?""<br />A: ""There are a lot of options. You can surprise her over dinner, or ask her in a public area, or if you have the balls, ask her father in front of her.""<br />B: ""I never thought about that.""<br />A: ""Thought about what?""<br />B: ""Asking her father in front of her. How do you think she will react?""<br />A: ""I don't know. You should know how she's going to react. She is your girlfriend.""<br />B: ""I think that's the idea I was looking for. Thanks man.""<br />A: ""Don't mention it. Good luck. You're going to need it.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What sport do you like the most?""<br />B: ""I like baseball the best.""<br />A: ""Me too. Did you play when you were a kid?""<br />B: ""Yeah. I played until I graduated from high school.""<br />A: ""What position did you play?""<br />B: ""I think I tried every position, but the last few years, I played third.""<br />A: ""I hate third base. It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast.""<br />B: ""It was scary at first, but after awhile, I got used to it. If you have fast reflexes, then it's not really a problem. What position did you play?""<br />A: ""I played outfield. I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces.""<br />B: ""I wish I could play again, but there isn't much opportunities around here.""<br />A: ""I'm on a softball league. It's not fast pitch, but it's still fun. You wanna join our group?""<br />B: ""When do you guys play?""<br />A: ""We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays.""<br />B: ""Sounds pretty fun. I'll come out and join you next time.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What sports do you like to play?""<br />B: ""I like baseball and basketball.""<br />A: ""How about football?""<br />B: ""In my country football is brand new, so I never learned the game when I was younger.""<br />A: ""It's a very popular game in America.""<br />B: ""Yeah. I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun?""<br />A: ""For me, it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play.""<br />B: ""Are you a football player?""<br />A: ""No, just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football. We're too old to play tackle football.""<br />B: ""What is two hand touch and flag football?""<br />A: ""Instead of tackling somebody, you just have to touch them with two hands, or if it is flag football, grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing.""<br />B: ""I see. It's safer then right?""<br />A: ""Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, you're welcome to join us.""<br />B: ""I'll give it a try. Give me a call and let's go down together.""<br />A: ""Ok. I'll call you Saturday morning.""<br />B: ""Great.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Steve. When's the next time you're going to play golf?""<br />B: ""I'm going out this Saturday.""<br />A: ""Do you already have a foursome?""<br />B: ""Unfortunately, we do. Let's plan for something together for Wednesday. We can go right after work.""<br />A: ""That sounds good. Where do you want to play?""<br />B: ""We won't have much time, so let's play somewhere close to work.""<br />A: ""How about Bellevue? It's pretty close.""<br />B: ""How much does it cost over there?""<br />A: ""Twilight rates are 21 dollars.""<br />B: ""That's pretty good. Let's do it.""<br />A: ""Aright. I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4:00.""<br />B: ""Make it 4:15. I won't get off until 4:00.""<br />A: ""Ok. I'll call you later when I get a tee time.""<br />B: ""Sounds good. I'll see you on Wednesday then.""<br />A: ""Aright. Have fun on Saturday.""<br />B: ""Will do.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jackie. What are you doing?""<br />B: ""Nothing much. I'm just relaxing today. Why? What's going on?""<br />A: ""I was thinking about heading to the mall. Do you want to go?""<br />B: ""Are they having a sale?""<br />A: ""Yeah. Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale. It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on.""<br />B: ""That sounds great. Where should we meet?""<br />A: ""I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes.""<br />B: ""Sounds good. See you there.""<br />A: ""What do you think about these shoes?""<br />B: ""They're cute. But do you think you'll wear them much?""<br />A: ""No. Not really.""<br />B: ""This sweater is so pretty. I love the low neck design.""<br />A: ""I bet it's expensive.""<br />B: ""It's on sale for $80. What do you think? Should I try them on?""<br />A: ""For 80 bucks it looks great. Go try it on.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Where is your dressing room?""<br />B: ""Right over there.""<br />Person A comes out of the dressing room<br />B: ""How did you like the sweater?""<br />A: ""I loved it. I'll take it.""<br />B: ""Great. I can ring you up over here. It comes to $87.04.""<br />A: ""Here you go?""<br />B: ""Do you have a credit card with us?""<br />A: ""No I don't.""<br />B: ""If you open up a card, you can save 10% on all your purchases today.""<br />A: ""Not today. Thanks though.""<br />B: ""No problem. We always have this offer, so when ever you decide to, just let us know.""<br />A: ""Sure.""<br />B: ""Is there anything else I can help you with?""<br />A: ""Yeah. I was looking at some of your pants, but they are all a bit too long. Do you have alteration services here?""<br />B: ""Yes. It cost $7, and it takes one day.""<br />A: ""Great. Thanks for your help.""<br />B: ""Thank you, and have a great day.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""I love your bracelet. When did you get it?""<br />B: ""I got it awhile ago, but I haven't worn it much. You really like it?""<br />A: ""Yeah. It's beautiful. Is it white gold or silver?""<br />B: ""It's white gold.""<br />A: ""Where did you buy it?""<br />B: ""My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co. and he let me pick it out.""<br />A: ""That's so sweet. What was the occasion?""<br />B: ""That's the best part. It wasn't for anything special. He just wanted to buy me something.""<br />A: ""You're so lucky. If he bought you something for no special day, I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday.""<br />B: ""My birthday is coming up next month. We'll find out pretty soon.""<br />A: ""What do you want?""<br />B: ""I wouldn't mind a necklace. I was at the jewelry shop looking around, and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want.""<br />A: ""Why not a ring?""<br />B: ""I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet.""<br />A: ""But you're ready for everything else?""<br />B: ""Damn right.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi. Can I help you with anything?""<br />B: ""Yeah. Can I look at this ring?""<br />A: ""Sure. Let me get it out for you. What is your size?""<br />B: ""I believe I am a six.""<br />A: ""Here you go.""<br />B: ""Would you have any necklace that would go well with this?""<br />A: ""Actually, we have a few to choose from. They are over here.""<br />B: ""There's no price tag on this necklace.""<br />A: ""Oh. I'm sorry. I'll check the price for you. It is $199.""<br />B: ""This necklace is a little short. Do you have one that is longer?""<br />A: ""Yes. Why don't you try this one on.""<br />B: ""This one is much better. Can I try on the ring with this necklace?""<br />A: ""Sure. Here you go.""<br />B: ""Let me think about it.""<br />A: ""Sure. Take your time.""<br />B: ""Thank you for all the help.""<br />A: ""No problem at all.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What a beautiful watch. It goes very well with your ring.""<br />B: ""Thank you.""<br />A: ""Is that your wedding ring?""<br />B: ""I'm not married yet. It's my engagement ring.""<br />A: ""Well, congratulations. When is the big date?""<br />B: ""In June.""<br />A: ""Did you have the watch before getting the ring?""<br />B: ""Actually, we bought the ring together after I got the watch.""<br />A: ""You did a fabulous job with the selection. It's gorgeous.""<br />B: ""Thank you so much.""<br />A: ""What kind of watch is it?""<br />B: ""It's a Tag Heuer.""<br />A: ""If you don't mind me asking, how much do they cost?""<br />B: ""This one is $1500. But they range from $600 to $3000.""<br />A: ""That's why it looks so nice. I should have figured. You always get what you pay for.""<br />B: ""Yeah. I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Suzie. Guess what? I'm having a baby!""<br />B: ""Really? That's so great. Congratulations.""<br />A: ""Thanks. I'm so excited. We've been trying for 8 months now.""<br />B: ""That's really exciting. How many months are you pregnant?""<br />A: ""Three months.""<br />B: ""Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl?""<br />A: ""I want to, but Bob doesn't. He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way.""<br />B: ""Maybe it's more exciting not knowing.""<br />A: ""I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time.""<br />B: ""There are so many things you have to prepare for.""<br />A: ""I know I am going to be busy, but I know I can handle it. I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time.""<br />B: ""It really must be an exciting time for you guys.""<br />A: ""Thank you so much.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Jared, I just heard about your father. How is he doing?""<br />B: ""He's in the hospital resting. The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet.""<br />A: ""I'm so sorry to hear that. But this is a good hospital. I'm sure they will do whatever they can.""<br />B: ""I hope so.""<br />A: ""You must feel really worried right now. But you know your dad is a fighter.""<br />B: ""Yeah. I think my mom is the most worried. I'm basically worried about how she is doing.""<br />A: ""Where is she right now?""<br />B: ""She's in the hospital with my dad. I have to go back tonight.""<br />A: ""Hey, I'll go with you.""<br />B: ""You don't have to.""<br />A: ""It's really no problem.""<br />B: ""Ok. Let's go right after dinner.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What stresses you out the most?""<br />B: ""Probably my parents.""<br />A: ""How so?""<br />B: ""Well, during school, they wanted good grades. Then after I got a job, they wanted me to get a better job. And finally, they want me to get married.""<br />A: ""You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents.""<br />B: ""Your parents are not like that?""<br />A: ""Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school, they never expected much.""<br />B: ""You're lucky.""<br />A: ""What do you do to deal with the stress?""<br />B: ""Not much I can do. It's always there. I sometimes go out with some friends and drink, but that's only a temporary solution. The stress always returns in the morning.""<br />A: ""That sucks. You wanna go grab a beer?""<br />B: ""Sure. Sounds great. Let's go.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Sarah. You look terrible. What's wrong?""<br />B: ""My grandmother just passed away.""<br />A: ""I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this happen?""<br />B: ""A couple of days ago. I just go back from the funeral.""<br />A: ""Is there anything I can do?""<br />B: ""No... not really. The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died. I really wanted to be there one last time.""<br />A: ""I'm sure she knew you loved her. Did she pass away in the hospital?""<br />B: ""Yeah. She died in her sleep.""<br />A: ""I'm sorry she's gone.""<br />B: ""At least she didn't suffer.""<br />A: ""I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together.""<br />B: ""I know. But I miss her.""<br />A: ""When my grandmother passed away, I frequently visited her in the cemetery. I always talked to her. Even though she wasn't there, I somehow knew she heard what I said.""<br />B: ""Yeah? That's what I was thinking too. Thanks.""<br />A: ""It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day. We should get you something to eat.""<br />B: ""You're right... I should eat something. Let's go.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Why are you so quiet?""<br />B: ""My girlfriend just broke up with me.""<br />A: ""You must feel terrible now.""<br />B: ""Yeah.""<br />A: ""I remember my first break up. It was the worst feeling in the world. I was crying everyday for three months. And slowly, it got better. I know you'll feel better too.""<br />B: ""You've been through this too?""<br />A: ""Yeah. I remember it very clearly. The pain makes it easy to remember. I know you're really hurting right now, but you know many people experience break ups.""<br />B: ""But it hurts too much.""<br />A: ""I know it's painful, but it's only temporary. After the pain goes away, you'll find other girls.""<br />B: ""What if I don't want to find another girl?""<br />A: ""You'll change your mind. Look at everyone in the world. They all break up and move on. The faster you understand this, the quicker you will recover.""<br />B: ""You're right.""<br />A: ""I also know you must still have strong feelings for her, but try to think of all the bad things. You know she didn't treat you that well. Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?""<br />B: ""Yeah. Thanks for the talk.""<br />A: ""I'll give you a call later. We should hang out. It's good to be around people.""<br />B: ""Ok. I'll talk to you later.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jack. How's it going?""<br />B: ""I'm falling in love.""<br />A: ""What! With who?""<br />B: ""That girl in my econ class. She is so hot.""<br />A: ""Did you guys go on a date already?""<br />B: ""No. I didn't even talk to her yet. But I think I'm in love.""<br />A: ""Does she have a boyfriend?""<br />B: ""I don't think so. I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy.""<br />A: ""Dude, you're a stalker man. Just ask her on a date.""<br />B: ""I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone. I think I'll ask her then.""<br />A: ""So why do you think you're in love?""<br />B: ""She's the only thing I can think of all day long.""<br />A: ""That's called blind love. Well, I gotta run. Tell me how it goes next week.""<br />B: ""Aright. I'll talk to you later.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Matt. I just got a job at a consulting firm.""<br />B: ""Congratulations. That's great!""<br />A: ""I'm so happy. I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore.""<br />B: ""When do you start?""<br />A: ""I start next Monday.""<br />B: ""You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know.""<br />A: ""I know. I'm a little nervous, but it's pretty exciting.""<br />B: ""I bet. You must be stoked.""<br />A: ""Yeah. I'm going to celebrate tonight. Wanna hang out?""<br />B: ""Sure. It's on you right?""<br />A: ""Of course. How about Toby? Should we call him?""<br />B: ""I don't know. He's a little depressed. He's having a hard time finding a job right now.""<br />A: ""I should still tell him. In the least, I can refer him to my company. It might help.""<br />B: ""That sounds like a good idea.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Martha. What's wrong? Why are you crying?""<br />B: ""Jake just broke up with me.""<br />A: ""I'm sorry. When did this happen?""<br />B: ""Yesterday. I didn't even know it was coming. He just told me he found someone else.""<br />A: ""What a jerk. He doesn't deserve you.""<br />B: ""But it still hurts. I thought I loved him.""<br />A: ""He didn't treat you that well either. Maybe you don't want to hear this, but I think you can do better.""<br />B: ""Better or worse, it doesn't matter. I had a lot of feelings for him. I really liked him""<br />A: ""It must be really painful. I remember when Josh and I broke up. I was crying for a week.""<br />B: ""I know I'll get over him. My first break up was painful because I was naive.""<br />A: ""Exactly. You'll find someone again. You should get your mind off of this. Let's go shopping.""<br />B: ""Maybe tomorrow. I don't feel like it tonight.""<br />A: ""How about coffee down the street?""<br />B: ""Sure.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi. My name is Mark.""<br />B: ""Mark? I'm Bill. Glad to meet you.""<br />A: ""Yeah. So where are you from?""<br />B: ""I'm from Houston Texas.""<br />A: ""Oh... I'm from Southern California.""<br />B: ""So, what year are you?""<br />A: ""I'm a freshman.""<br />B: ""This is my first year too.""<br />A: ""So what made you decide to come to California for school? I hear Austin is a good school.""<br />B: ""It's aright, but I think Berkeley is better.""<br />A: ""So is this where you wanted to come?""<br />B: ""To tell you the truth, I wanted to go to Stanford. I made it on the waiting list, but ninety nine percent of the people accepted to Stanford go there. Like, who wouldn't right?""<br />A: ""Very true. But this is still a good school.""<br />B: ""I'm not complaining. I just know that I wanted to come to California. Texas is cool and all, but I wanted to experience different things.""<br />A: ""That's good. Do you know what you plan on majoring in?""<br />B: ""I was thinking about political science, but now I'm leaning towards English literature. How about you?""<br />A: ""I plan on majoring in double E.""<br />B: ""Do you know where the Smith building is? I have to pick up the syllabus for my psychology class. I missed the first day.""<br />A: ""That's a great start. It's over there by the library.""<br />B: ""It was nice meeting you.""<br />A: ""Yeah. We should hang out later.""<br />B: ""Cool. I'll see you tomorrow in class then.""<br />A: ""Aright. Later.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jack. You look tired. What's going on?""<br />B: ""It's finals week and I have been up all night studying.""<br />A: ""How many exams do you have left?""<br />B: ""Three more to go?""<br />A: ""Have you been keeping up, or are you cramming everything?""<br />B: ""If I was keeping up, I wouldn't need to stay up all night.""<br />A: ""Ha ha ha. Looks like you are in for a tough week.""<br />B: ""Tell me about it. How about you? What have you been up to?""<br />A: ""I finished my last final this morning.""<br />B: ""So you're completely done?""<br />A: ""No. I have one more report that is due this Friday. I haven't started it yet, but it shouldn't be too tough.""<br />B: ""How many pages do you have to write?""<br />A: ""It's a 10 page paper on habitual behavior for psychology 211.""<br />B: ""You wanna take one of my exams for me?""<br />A: ""I would if I could, but you know that's not possible.""<br />B: ""Yeah, I know.""<br />A: ""If you need help with your chemistry class, I can help you over the weekend.""<br />B: ""That would be great.""<br />A: ""Let's get together Saturday around lunch time.""<br />B: ""You don't know how much this means to me. Thanks.""<br />A: ""Don't mention it. I'll see you on Saturday.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi. My name is Jack.""<br />B: ""Hey Jack. I'm Seth.""<br />A: ""It's nice to meet you.""<br />B: ""Looks like we're going to be roommates.""<br />A: ""Yeah.""<br />B: ""So where are you from?""<br />A: ""I'm from Tacoma. How about you?""<br />B: ""I'm from Ontario.""<br />A: ""In Canada?""<br />B: ""No. It's in California. It's a smaller city in southern California.""<br />A: ""So what made you come here?""<br />B: ""I wanted to go to a different state.""<br />A: ""I see. Hey, if you don't mind, I took this side of the room.""<br />B: ""No problem. They look the same to me.""<br />A: ""Are you a morning person or a night person.""<br />B: ""I'm a night person.""<br />A: ""That's great. So am I. I like to sleep in the morning.""<br />B: ""That should work out well then.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi. I'm Sara.""<br />B: ""My name is Jessica. It's nice to meet you.""<br />A: ""Yes. It's nice to meet you as well.""<br />B: ""Have you been here long?""<br />A: ""I got here about an hour ago. Do you want me to show you around?""<br />B: ""Yeah. That would be great. The most important is the bathroom right?""<br />A: ""Definitely. But we have to share the bathroom with the whole floor. The break room is over there. The bathroom is right across from the break room, and finally, the RA (resident advisor) is in room 315.""<br />B: ""I'm glad there is a TV in the break room. I like to watch TV.""<br />A: ""Me too. So I brought one. I haven't unpacked it yet, but it's a little TV that works.""<br />B: ""Cool. I brought a refrigerator. I like to store some snacks in there. Feel free to use it.""<br />A: ""That would be perfect. I think we're going to have a great time.""<br />B: ""Do you sleep pretty late, or are you a morning person.""<br />A: ""I have never been either. I'm very flexible with sleeping times. Anyways, I'm a deep sleeper so a little noise never bothers me.""<br />B: ""That's good to know. I'm usually a night person, but I'm very quiet if my roommate is sleeping.""<br />A: ""As long as you don't blast the music while I'm sleeping, I should be fine. Did you eat lunch yet?""<br />B: ""No. Is there a cafeteria in the building?""<br />A: ""Yeah. I'll show you.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""I'm calling about the available room. Is it still available?""<br />B: ""Yes it is. Do you know where we're located?""<br />A: ""Yeah. I drove by this morning and I liked the location. What's the rent?""<br />B: ""It's $850 a month. So you would pay $425 a month plus half of the bills.""<br />A: ""How big is the place?""<br />B: ""It's a two bedroom, one bath and roughly about 800 square feet.""<br />A: ""Is the complex pretty quiet? Can you hear a lot of noise or anything like that?""<br />B: ""They have a strict policy in the apartment complex concerning noise level. So it stays very quiet after 10 PM.""<br />A: ""Are you the only person who lives there now?""<br />B: ""Yeah. I'm only looking for one roommate.""<br />A: ""Everything sounds good. Can we schedule a time to meet so I can look at the place?""<br />B: ""I'm available anytime today or tomorrow.""<br />A: ""How about if I come over now?""<br />B: ""That works with me. But what is your name?""<br />A: ""Oh, my name is Brad.""<br />B: ""Ok. I'm Randy. So I'll see you in a bit?""<br />A: ""Should only take about 15 minutes to get there.""<br />B: ""Sounds good.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jane. How are you doing?""<br />B: ""Hi Jack. I'm doing great.""<br />A: ""I hope you haven't been waiting too long.""<br />B: ""No. I just got here a few minutes ago.""<br />A: ""Do you know if smoking is allowed here?""<br />B: ""I think this is a no-smoking place. Do you want to go somewhere else?""<br />A: ""That's alright. I don't need to smoke.""<br />B: ""Why don't you quit?""<br />A: ""I never thought about it. All my friends smoke, and we hang out a lot.""<br />B: ""So do you smoke by yourself?""<br />A: ""When I started I didn't, but after a few months I started smoking at home. Usually when I'm bored.""<br />B: ""Do you smoke cause you're bored?""<br />A: ""Yeah. It helps to kill the time. I also think it's out of habit. I'm so used to having a cigarette every now and then.""<br />B: ""How much do you smoke in a day?""<br />A: ""I smoke about a half pack a day.""<br />B: ""Well, I think you should quit. You know it's bad for you?""<br />A: ""I always knew it was bad, but I never thought about it.""<br />B: ""You better start thinking about it now. You might not feel the difference now, but after 10 years of smoking, you might feel it and then it will be too late.""<br />A: ""That's a good point. I'll try to quit.""<br />B: ""Good. And if you need any support, I'll always be here for you.""<br />A: ""Thanks.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey John. I didn't know you were coming to this school.""<br />B: ""Yeah, what a coincidence. It's good to see you.""<br />A: ""It's been a while hasn't it?""<br />B: ""What have you been up to?""<br />A: ""Not much. Just school and stuff.""<br />B: ""Where are you going now?""<br />A: ""I'm going to the registration building to see if I can withdrawal from one of my classes.""<br />B: ""Are you bombing the class or something?""<br />A: ""Partially that, but mostly it's a boring class and I am getting nothing out of it.""<br />B: ""Where are you off to?""<br />A: ""I finished class for today so I am meeting my girlfriend to watch a movie?""<br />B: ""What are you watching?""<br />A: ""The Lord of the Rings. I haven't seen it yet. Have you?""<br />B: ""Yeah, I saw that about a month ago. It was really good.""<br />A: ""Don't tell me anything about it. I don't want to ruin the surprise.""<br />B: ""No problem. Hey, what are you doing this weekend?""<br />A: ""Nothing really. I was going to rent a video and just hang out at home.""<br />B: ""My fraternity is going to have a party on Saturday night. Wanna come?""<br />A: ""Hey, that sounds like fun. What fraternity are you in?""<br />B: ""I'm over at the Delta Fraternity house.""<br />A: ""Cool. Give me your number and I'll call you Saturday.""<br />B: ""It's 206-555-1212.""<br />A: ""Aright. I'll see you on Saturday.""<br />B: ""See you later.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""You're Jason right?""<br />B: ""Yeah. Tom right?""<br />A: ""Yeah. What's going on?""<br />B: ""Not much. Just hanging out. A bunch of guys are playing a game for shots.""<br />A: ""You're not playing?""<br />B: ""I had enough to drink already.""<br />A: ""I hear ya.""<br />B: ""You in school or do you work?""<br />A: ""I work at a marketing company. How about you?""<br />B: ""I'm still in school. I have one more year left.""<br />A: ""What are you majoring in?""<br />B: ""I'm majoring in computer science.""<br />A: ""Where do you want to work?""<br />B: ""I would love to work at Microsoft. But it's pretty tough to get in.""<br />A: ""So I hear. So you come to this club often?""<br />B: ""Every now and then. I usually hang out at Pioneer Square.""<br />A: ""Yeah. That's a cool place. There are a ton of bars to hit in that area.""<br />B: ""Are you here with Mike?""<br />A: ""No. Some of my work buddies. I haven't seen Mike in a while now. Do you know what he is up to?""<br />B: ""He's going to grad school.""<br />A: ""What a surprise. I didn't know he was so studious.""<br />B: ""Yeah. Surprised us all. Hey, I'm going to get another drink. You want one?""<br />A: ""It's aright. I still have to work on this one.""<br />B: ""I'll catch you later.""<br />A: ""Aright man.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi. My name is Robert.""<br />B: ""I'm John. It's nice to meet you.""<br />A: ""Do you know what this professor is like?""<br />B: ""I have no idea. This is my first year.""<br />A: ""You a freshman? Me too. Where are you from?""<br />B: ""I'm from San Francisco.""<br />A: ""I've been there a few times. It's a great city.""<br />B: ""Where are you from?""<br />A: ""I grew up in this area all my life.""<br />B: ""So you know where all the fun places to hang out right?""<br />A: ""Yeah. The best place is over by the water. They have a lot of clubs and bars.""<br />B: ""I drove by that area before. I didn't know it was a college hang-out.""<br />A: ""It gets pretty wild over there sometimes. You should go.""<br />B: ""Sounds like a good idea. Do you know what you are majoring in yet?""<br />A: ""Not yet. I'm leaning towards business, but that's only if I can't get into computer science. How about you?""<br />B: ""I want to go to med school, so I'll probably end up majoring in biology.""<br />A: ""That's cool.""<br />B: ""Is the weather this bad all the time in the fall?""<br />A: ""Yap. This is a typical autumn. It gets worse though. At least it's not raining that much.""<br />B: ""That sucks.""<br />A: ""You'll get used to it. In the meantime, you'll have to watch a lot of movies. Seems like the only thing to do with the bad weather.""<br />B: ""Too expensive. Can you believe how much movies cost these days?""<br />A: ""Yeah. It's crazy. It's like 9 bucks a movie. I remember when it was half that.""<br />B: ""Unless it's a date, I'm not going to pay that much to watch a movie.""<br />A: ""That makes sense.""<br />B: ""Oh. The professor is coming. I'll talk to you later.""<br />A: ""Aright.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi there. Do you know anyone here?""<br />B: ""I'm a friend of Stacy.""<br />A: ""Stacy Miller? I know her.""<br />B: ""Really? How do you know her?""<br />A: ""We went to middle school together.""<br />B: ""That's cool. What a small world.""<br />A: ""So how do you know Stacy?""<br />B: ""We went to the same sorority.""<br />A: ""What did you major in?""<br />B: ""I majored in Sociology.""<br />A: ""Really? Me too. That's kinda cool.""<br />B: ""Where did you go to school?""<br />A: ""I went to Berkley.""<br />B: ""So what are you doing here in New York?""<br />A: ""I work at a consulting firm.""<br />B: ""Isn't that hard work?""<br />A: ""It was in the beginning, but I got used to it. It's a lot of hours though.""<br />B: ""I bet. I don't like working more than 40 hours. I need time to play.""<br />A: ""I hear that. I wish I had more time to play. But I do like my job.""<br />B: ""I think it is important to like your job.""<br />A: ""I like talking with you.""<br />B: ""Really? I feel the same way.""<br />A: ""Do, you wanna go out sometime, like dinner or something?""<br />B: ""I'd like that. Here, let me give you my number.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey honey, where do you think we should go for our honeymoon?""<br />B: ""I always wanted to go to Mexico. Cancun is supposed to be a great place.""<br />A: ""That sounds pretty good. But how about the Caribbean?""<br />B: ""That doesn't sound too bad either. Do you know how much it would cost for airfare and hotel?""<br />A: ""If we go for 5 nights, then the total for airfare and hotel would be about one thousand seven hundred dollars. How much would it be to go to Cancun?""<br />B: ""I found a deal for only twelve hundred dollars.""<br />A: ""That's a lot cheaper. Let's go to Cancun then.""<br />B: ""Really? That sounds great. I picked up a lot of brochures. Let's take a look at all the things we can do.""<br />A: ""That reminds me. I better make sure my passport is not expired.""<br />B: ""You better make sure. If it's expired, you have to hurry and renew it.""<br />A: ""We still have a couple of months. No rush.""<br />B: ""What do you want to do in Cancun?""<br />A: ""I want to golf at least one day. And I also want to try surfing. Do they have instructors on the beach?""<br />B: ""Yeah. This brochure shows lesson and equipment rentals and everything. That shouldn't be a problem. I want to try snorkeling.""<br />A: ""Do we need to buy snorkeling gear?""<br />B: ""No. We can just rent it there.""<br />A: ""Sounds like we're going to have fun.""<br />B: ""I know. I can't wait. It's going to be so fun.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Where are you guys going for your honeymoon?""<br />B: ""We decided on Cancun, Mexico.""<br />A: ""I've been there before. It's a great place.""<br />B: ""What did you do there?""<br />A: ""There is so much to do. It's a big tourist place so there is access to everything.""<br />B: ""That's good. I'm looking forward to our honeymoon. Especially after all the wedding plans I had to do.""<br />A: ""How long are you going for?""<br />B: ""We decided on 6 days. We are leaving on Sunday and returning on Saturday.""<br />A: ""That should give you plenty of time. Do you have all your travel plans in order?""<br />B: ""We just booked our flight and got our room. Everything is set.""<br />A: ""You're going to have so much fun. I'm so jealous.""<br />B: ""When you get married, you'll have your chance.""<br />A: ""I need to find a guy first.""<br />B: ""Where do you want to go for your honeymoon?""<br />A: ""Since I've been to Mexico and Hawaii before, I want to go to Australia.""<br />B: ""That sounds great. It's a little out of our budget so we didn't even consider Australia.""<br />A: ""For the price, Cancun is one of the best so don't have any regrets. It is a great place. So do you have a ride to the airport?""<br />B: ""My brother is going to drop us off.""<br />A: ""Looks like everything is set. Just make sure to take a camera. I know many people who forgot to take a camera on their honeymoon.""<br />B: ""Will do. Thanks.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Samantha. You've been so busy lately. What have you been up to?""<br />B: ""Hey Jackie. I started dating this cute guy and decided to start exercising.""<br />A: ""You're not out of shape. You look fine.""<br />B: ""Well, this guy I am seeing is a personal trainer and he has a perfect body. Compared to him, I need some work.""<br />A: ""How long have you seen him?""<br />B: ""We've been together for about a month and a half.""<br />A: ""Did you sleep with him yet?""<br />B: ""Not yet. But before I get into bed with him, I want to look fit.""<br />A: ""That's not the greatest reason to exercise, but I guess it is a valid one.""<br />B: ""How about you? Anything new in your life?""<br />A: ""My father is a little ill. He has been to the doctor's quite a bit lately but they don't know what is wrong with him. He complains about stomach pains a lot these days.""<br />B: ""I'm sorry to hear that. Any idea what could have caused it?""<br />A: ""He says it is because he didn't take care of himself when he was young. That's why I want to start thinking about my health.""<br />B: ""I think it is important to take care of yourself while you are young too. Even though my reasons are not the best, at least I am working on it.""<br />A: ""How are your parents doing?""<br />B: ""They're doing great. I'm thankful that they are healthy.""<br />A: ""That's good to hear. Well, I gotta get running now. I'll catch you later.""<br />B: ""Ok. Send my regards to your father.""<br />A: ""I will. Thanks.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Wow Billy. Looks like you lost a lot of weight. I could hardly recognize you.""<br />B: ""Thanks. I've been on a diet for about 6 months. I'm going to ask Rachel to marry me soon and I want to be mentally and physically healthy.""<br />A: ""What does being overweight have anything to do with marriage? If you love each other, that's enough right?""<br />B: ""Yeah, but I want to show her how much she means to me, and this is one way of proving it. I am changing for the better.""<br />A: ""Good for you. Hey, when do you plan on proposing to her?""<br />B: ""I think I am going to propose to her on our 2 year anniversary.""<br />A: ""Is she expecting it, or will it be a surprise?""<br />B: ""I think she expects me to ask her one of these days, but not anytime soon.""<br />A: ""You sure you want to settle down already? You're only 25 years old?""<br />B: ""Yeah, I didn't think I would get married until I was 30, but when you know she is the one, why wait.""<br />A: ""That's true. Hey, I hope everything works out. You're going to invite me to your wedding right?""<br />B: ""Of course man.""<br />A: ""Gosh, I'm still shocked how much weight you lost. You're getting real skinny now.""<br />B: ""I am working on a six pack now. I have two lines starting to show up. I've been spending a lot of time at the gym. It is hard work, but I feel so good after working out.""<br />A: ""Where do you work out?""<br />B: ""I have a membership at Bally's. It's not too expensive and I like all the equipment they have.""<br />A: ""I've been thinking about joining a gym. Are they having any specials right now?""<br />B: ""Yeah, they do. They have free enrollment and first month free. You should come by. I'll show you around. I can take in a guest so you can try it out before signing up.""<br />A: ""That sounds good. Let's go this Saturday.""<br />B: ""Cool. I'll call you in the morning.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Stephanie. Guess what?""<br />B: ""What?""<br />A: ""Robert asked me to marry him. We're getting married.""<br />B: ""Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. So when is the big day?""<br />A: ""We haven't set the date exactly, but it looks like it will be sometime in July.""<br />B: ""How did he propose to you?""<br />A: ""On valentines day, he got me a present. I thought it was an ordinary valentines day present, but when I opened it, it was this big diamond ring. Right then, he got on his knees and proposed.""<br />B: ""That's so neat. So you really got surprised?""<br />A: ""We talked about marriage a little, but I never knew he was serious.""<br />B: ""You are going to be busy with wedding plans. But you have several months to prepare for it.""<br />A: ""It's going to be pretty hectic for me. So I'm going to need some help. First of all, I was wondering if you would like to be my Maid of Honor.""<br />B: ""I would be honored.""<br />A: ""So you're going to help me with the planning right?""<br />B: ""Of course. How many brides maids are you going to have?""<br />A: ""Three. So we will have a total of four.""<br />B: ""Let me guess. Susan, Tina, and Cindy.""<br />A: ""Close. I'm going to have Cindy as the candle lighter. The third brides maid is going to be Lydia. She is a good friend from church.""<br />B: ""I know her. She's sweet. I'll make sure we have the best wedding for you.""<br />A: ""I hope so. I appreciate your help.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Yo Matt. How goes it man?""<br />B: ""Pretty good. What have you been up to?""<br />A: ""You know that chick in psychology class?""<br />B: ""Yeah. You only talk about her every other day.""<br />A: ""I can't get her out of my mind. She is damn fine.""<br />B: ""Why don't you go talk to her then?""<br />A: ""I think she is out of my league.""<br />B: ""Chicken. Somebody is only out of your league if you think so. What do you see in her anyway? She is a little chubby dude.""<br />A: ""She is not. She has a nice figure. And she has such a pretty face.""<br />B: ""Whatever. If you think so.""<br />A: ""You like skinny girls or something?""<br />B: ""I like normal girls without any flab hanging out.""<br />A: ""Now you're exaggerating you freak.""<br />B: ""Seriously, I like a girl who is fit and likes to exercise.""<br />A: ""How about personality?""<br />B: ""It doesn't matter until you are thinking about marriage and I'm not thinking about that yet.""<br />A: ""Well, I'm looking so I don't care that much about figure. As long as she is nice and sweet.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Do you like to watch baseball?""<br />B: ""Yeah. I follow the Mariners every year.""<br />A: ""I wonder how they will do this year.""<br />B: ""I don't know if they have a chance. Did you hear that A-Rod went to the Yankees?""<br />A: ""I know. Their team was too good even before getting Alex.""<br />B: ""Yeah. The richest team is usually the best team. They need to put a salary cap to make things fair.""<br />A: ""I agree. I don't know why they haven't done so already.""<br />B: ""But don't lose hope too soon. The Yankees don't have a good pitching staff this year. They might end up like the Texas Rangers. Great offense, no pitching.""<br />A: ""I highly doubt that. Even though they lost Pettite, they still have a decent pitching rotation.""<br />B: ""We'll see. I hope the Mariners do well this year.""<br />A: ""Me too. Oh, did you buy any tickets this year?""<br />B: ""I got a couple of games with Oakland and Boston, but I couldn't get anything with the Yankees.""<br />A: ""Same here. I went in on the second day and all the tickets with the Yankees were already sold out.""<br />B: ""There's still plenty of other games though. We should go together one of these days.""<br />A: ""Sounds good. Let's plan for late June.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Do you know when basketball season starts?""<br />B: ""It starts in October. How come?""<br />A: ""I like to keep up with the Lakers.""<br />B: ""You keep up with baseball at all?""<br />A: ""Just a little. Not as much as basketball.""<br />B: ""Who is your favorite player?""<br />A: ""Probably Kobe Bryant, but he has too many issues right now.""<br />B: ""He's a great player, but his recent problem is really affecting his play.""<br />A: ""Hope everything turns out ok. Do you play basketball much?""<br />B: ""I usually get into it during the playoffs. I'd rather play than watch.""<br />A: ""I like to watch as much as I like to play. Do you play often?""<br />B: ""Every now and then with some friends.""<br />A: ""I usually play twice a week at the health club. It's easy to round up 10 guys during the evening time.""<br />B: ""That sounds pretty fun. But I'm too out of shape to play full court.""<br />A: ""I get tired too, but I figure it's good for my health. And I'm having fun at the same time.""<br />B: ""So you think the Lakers will do good this year?""<br />A: ""They better. They got a lot of good players now. If Malone can stay healthy, then I don't see how they can be beat.""<br />B: ""I don't know... I think Sacramento has a strong team this year.""<br />A: ""True, but I'm pulling for the Lakers all the way. It's going to be a great season.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What are you watching?""<br />B: ""A football game. Packers are playing the Chiefs.""<br />A: ""I never understood this game.""<br />B: ""It's not that hard. If you watch a couple of games, you'll start to understand it.""<br />A: ""Do you watch a lot of football?""<br />B: ""I like the Packers, so I watch all their games.""<br />A: ""Did you play football before?""<br />B: ""Only in high school. I was too small to play for college.""<br />A: ""What position did you play?""<br />B: ""I was the corner back.""<br />A: ""Is that the main guy in offense?""<br />B: ""No. That's the quarterback. The corner back is a defensive player covering passing plays and outside running plays.""<br />A: ""I see. Do you think it is more fun than baseball?""<br />B: ""It's hard to compare the two because they're so different. I like both baseball and football. How about you? You like baseball a lot?""<br />A: ""Yeah. I'm a big baseball fan.""<br />B: ""Baseball is fun, but you should also learn football. I'll explain as we watch.""<br />A: ""Cool.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""How did you golf on Saturday?""<br />B: ""I did pretty good. I shot a 13.""<br />A: ""Not too bad. I thought you were going to break single.""<br />B: ""I had a chance. I shot a 4 on the front nine, but the back nine killed me.""<br />A: ""What happened?""<br />B: ""My drive was totally off. All of the sudden, I started hooking the ball. I hit two balls OB, and that killed my score right there.""<br />A: ""That sucks. You could have broken single if it wasn't for the penalty strokes.""<br />B: ""Yeah. I was so frustrated after that hole. But overall, I shot well, so I'm not too disappointed. How about you? How have you been hitting lately?""<br />A: ""I hit great on the range, but when I get on the course, I can't seem to hit the ball right.""<br />B: ""That happened to me for the longest time. It just takes time and practice. When you go out on the course more often, that problem will fix itself.""<br />A: ""I'm still trying to break 90. I've been hitting in the mid nineties for ever.""<br />B: ""How far does your driver go?""<br />A: ""I don't use it that much. I use my 3 wood more. I'm not consistent with the driver to use it.""<br />B: ""You gotta keep practicing with it. Eventually you'll get the hang of it.""<br />A: ""Yeah. I practice with it on the range, but I'm not making any progress on it.""<br />B: ""Let's go to the range together and I'll check out your swing.""<br />A: ""That sounds good. Let's go tomorrow night.""<br />B: ""Ok. That will give us practice for our round on Wednesday.""<br />A: ""I'll meet you there at 6:30.""<br />B: ""Ok. See you tomorrow then.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jack. What did you do last weekend?""<br />B: ""Josh had a bunch of guys over at his house and we played poker.""<br />A: ""Why didn't you guys call me?""<br />B: ""We did. But you weren't home. If you had a cell phone, maybe you wouldn't be left out.""<br />A: ""Yeah. I need to get a cell phone. So, what games did you play?""<br />B: ""We only play Texas Hold 'em.""<br />A: ""That's all good. What was the bid amount?""<br />B: ""We started playing no limit. It's so much fun.""<br />A: ""That sounds awesome. Let me join you next time.""<br />B: ""No problem. Just get a cell phone so we can contact you.""<br />A: ""Aright. Who won though?""<br />B: ""John. He always wins. He's damn good.""<br />A: ""You only played one game?""<br />B: ""We played 2 games and he won both of them.""<br />A: ""What is the buy in?""<br />B: ""Only 10 bucks.""<br />A: ""That sounds fun. Ten bucks isn't that much money to have fun while chilling with your friends.""<br />B: ""Exactly.""<br />A: ""But what happens if you get out in the first ten minutes?""<br />B: ""Then you're screwed. You can watch tv or play the XBOX.""<br />A: ""Better not die soon then. So, when is the next time you guys are playing?""<br />B: ""Probably this Friday. Give me a call Friday morning and I'll let you know the exact time.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Cindy. I heard you are seeing someone.""<br />B: ""Yeah. His name is John. I started dating him a week ago.""<br />A: ""That's so exciting. Tell me all about him. Is he good looking?""<br />B: ""I think he's cute, but not drop dead gorgeous.""<br />A: ""How did you meet him?""<br />B: ""I go to this coffee shop a lot and this guy is always there. We started talking a couple of times, and he finally asked me out.""<br />A: ""That's so cool. What does he do for a living?""<br />B: ""He works in the finance department in a manufacturing company.""<br />A: ""Do you know if he makes a lot of money?""<br />B: ""I don't know for sure, but he drives a nice car and I heard he has a house.""<br />A: ""How is his personality?""<br />B: ""He's very smart and a great person to talk to. In the beginning, we talked for about 30 minutes a day in the coffee shop before he asked me out. Besides that, he's very sweet and romantic.""<br />A: ""How old is he?""<br />B: ""That's the problem. He is 2 years younger than me. What do you think about that?""<br />A: ""What's the big deal? I don't see anything wrong with that. If you were 23, then I might be worried he was immature, but you're almost 30 now. 2 years is no big deal.""<br />B: ""Yeah. That's what I think.""<br />A: ""When do I get to meet him?""<br />B: ""How about a double date. The four of us can go out to dinner and a drink or something.""<br />A: ""That sounds great. How about next Saturday?""<br />B: ""I think Saturday will be good. Let's double check with the guys and get back to each other.""<br />A: ""Great. I'll call you later then.""<br />B: ""Ok. Talk to you later.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Jane. Did you see that guy standing by the dance floor?""<br />B: ""Yeah. He's kinda cute.""<br />A: ""Wait. Isn't that Beth's boyfriend?""<br />B: ""I'm not sure. I haven't met him before.""<br />A: ""Look. He's dancing with another girl.""<br />B: ""Are you sure that's him?""<br />A: ""No. It just looks like him.""<br />B: ""I heard he was a nice guy. He wouldn't be cheating on Beth.""<br />A: ""Yeah. You're right. How do you know about him if you never met him?""<br />B: ""I hear all this stuff from Beth. She is always going off on how nice and sweet he is.""<br />A: ""I heard the same thing. What type of guy are you looking for?""<br />B: ""Someone who is understanding, responsible, sensitive, smart, and with a lot of money.""<br />A: ""Don't we all. Get real. All those guys are probably already taken.""<br />B: ""It doesn't hurt to have expectations. What type of guy do you want to find?""<br />A: ""All I want is someone who is going to treat me well.""<br />B: ""You know Alex don't you? He likes you. I bet he'll take good care of you.""<br />A: ""He's a dork. At least someone who is not an idiot ok?""<br />B: ""Got it.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Jason. What are you doing this Friday?""<br />B: ""I'm going to go to the driving range cause I'm playing golf on Saturday.""<br />A: ""You're golfing without me? What's up with that?""<br />B: ""Sorry man, but we already have a foursome. I'm going with a couple of guys from work.""<br />A: ""Where are you playing?""<br />B: ""Washington National. Have you been there yet?""<br />A: ""I've been there a couple of times. It's a great course. You know the Huskies play there right?""<br />B: ""I didn't know that. Is it a hard course?""<br />A: ""It's pretty challenging. But it all depends on which tee you play from.""<br />B: ""What are you shooting these days?""<br />A: ""I'm still hovering around a bogey game.""<br />B: ""Still better than me. I'm still trying to hit a bogey game. Do you want to hit the driving range with me?""<br />A: ""I can't this Friday. I'm playing basketball with the guys that night.""<br />B: ""At night?""<br />A: ""Yeah. We're playing indoors at a school gymnasium.""<br />B: ""What's the occasion?""<br />A: ""Just a small league I play on. Nothing special.""<br />B: ""I'm too short to play basketball.""<br />A: ""You're not that short. Plus, we have a couple of guys who are the same height as you. They're awesome players.""<br />B: ""I never got into basketball. It's fun and all, but maybe I'm just not good at it.""<br />A: ""It's still great exercise. I get a better workout from basketball than I do from the treadmill.""<br />B: ""That's true.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What do you think about Matt's new girlfriend?""<br />B: ""Samantha? She's pretty hot. I can't believe she fell for Matt.""<br />A: ""I don't seem to have much luck with girls.""<br />B: ""Why do you think that is?""<br />A: ""I say the stupidest things around girls. I don't know why I do that?""<br />B: ""It's because you're nervous. Best thing to do is not say a word until you know it's not stupid.""<br />A: ""It doesn't work that way. I stop thinking around pretty girls.""<br />B: ""I know. You got to date a girl who isn't that pretty then.""<br />A: ""What the story of your love life these days?""<br />B: ""It's only been a couple of months that I broke up with Sarah. But I think it's about time to start hunting again.""<br />A: ""Who's your type?""<br />B: ""Anybody with a nice body and a pretty face.""<br />A: ""How about their personality or their character?""<br />B: ""I'm not thinking about marriage, so those things don't matter.""<br />A: ""You're so shallow.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""So Mark. What is your favorite hobby?""<br />B: ""Probably sports.""<br />A: ""Anything specific? Or just sports in general.""<br />B: ""Most sports. I like basketball, football, baseball, golf, tennis, so I guess most sports.""<br />A: ""I like tennis. Did you play for your high school team?""<br />B: ""Yeah. I played on the varsity team starting from my sophomore year. How about you?""<br />A: ""I played my junior and senior year.""<br />B: ""What other sports did you play?""<br />A: ""I played volleyball. I would have to say volleyball is my favorite.""<br />B: ""What position did you play?""<br />A: ""I was the outside hitter.""<br />B: ""That's so cool. I didn't know you were athletic.""<br />A: ""I don't know if I would consider myself athletic, but I have fun playing.""<br />B: ""I play on a co-ed volleyball team every Tuesdays. We're always looking for more girls to play on our team. Would you be interested?""<br />A: ""Yeah. It sounds fun. Just call me anytime you need a player.""<br />B: ""That's great. Since we are on the topic of sports, what sport do you like to watch on television?""<br />A: ""I never got into watching sports on TV. So I really don't know.""<br />B: ""Not even the Super bowl?""<br />A: ""Only when the group of people I'm with is watching it. I just never had interest in TV that much.""<br />B: ""Well, I like following the Mariners. They're pretty good.""<br />A: ""I like to go watch them play. It's fun when you are actually there.""<br />B: ""A bunch of us are going to watch them play this June. Do you want to join us?""<br />A: ""Yeah. I'll go. I like the new stadium. It's pretty cool.""<br />B: ""Ok. I'll make sure to get you a ticket as well.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What did Mike get you for your birthday Pam?""<br />B: ""He got me a watch. See.""<br />A: ""That's beautiful. He must have spent a fortune on it.""<br />B: ""He's so great. I think he might propose pretty soon.""<br />A: ""How do you know? Did he give you any clues?""<br />B: ""He took me to a jewelry store and asked me what type of rings I like. It was a little obvious, but at least I got to pick the one I wanted.""<br />A: ""That's not so romantic?""<br />B: ""He was never romantic. Silly and cute, but not romantic. I like all his quirkiness. He always makes me laugh.""<br />A: ""I guess you can't ask for much more than that.""<br />B: ""How is it going with you and Brad?""<br />A: ""We broke up a week ago.""<br />B: ""I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?""<br />A: ""I think we both just started to grow apart. I wasn't surprised.""<br />B: ""Are you doing ok?""<br />A: ""Actually, I'm feeling great. I guess I needed some freedom.""<br />B: ""Have you started seeing other guys yet?""<br />A: ""Not yet, but I when I meet a decent guy, I wouldn't mind dating again.""<br />B: ""What kind of guy are you looking for?""<br />A: ""Although my relationship with Brad wasn't that bad, I want a guy who likes to go out more. Brad always spent all his time studying and researching for school. It was quite boring.""<br />B: ""You definitely need a guy who likes to have fun.""<br />A: ""I wouldn't mind dating a romantic guy. Maybe I'm dreaming, but a nice walk down the beach, or dancing in the moonlight would be something I would love to do.""<br />B: ""Hey. There are guys like that. All you have to do is find the right one.""<br />A: ""But that's the hard part. I always fall for the guy who is smart. And then after a couple of months, I get bored.""<br />B: ""Doesn't a tall, good looking guy turn you on?""<br />A: ""Not really. What should I do?""<br />B: ""We should go to a club this Saturday and find a smart romantic guy. How does that sound?""<br />A: ""That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.""<br />B: ""Great. I'll see you at nine then.""<br />A: ""Ok. See you later.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hey Mike. I heard about your break up. You must be devastated.""<br />B: ""It's more than I can bear. I don't think I can go on.""<br />A: ""Come on Mike. It's not the end of the world.""<br />B: ""It's the end of my world. She was everything to me. I loved her so much.""<br />A: ""I remember my first break up. I remember it was the hardest thing I ever went through. So I know it must be really tough right now.""<br />B: ""Every night, I cry myself to sleep. Can you believe that I actually cry everyday?""<br />A: ""It's normal to cry. You shouldn't feel bad about it. It's the only way to let it out.""<br />B: ""How long will I feel like this? How long is the pain going to last?""<br />A: ""It's different for everyone, but it took me four months to get over Jessica.""<br />B: ""Four months... I have to live in hell for four months...""<br />A: ""But I'm ok now. I moved on and I'm dating other great people. I know you will be better.""<br />B: ""Why do you think she left me?""<br />A: ""I really don't know. Some people change and they want to go in different directions.""<br />B: ""But I loved her so much. I loved her more than anything in this world. She was my world.""<br />A: ""I know you love her.""<br />B: ""I don't think I'll be able to love anyone again.""<br />A: ""I thought that too. I thought Jessica was the only person I would ever love. But it changes. It really does. You'll get better and become a stronger person.""<br />B: ""I hope so.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What are you afraid of?""<br />B: ""I'm not sure. I used to be scared of a lot of things when I was young, but not anymore.""<br />A: ""Are you afraid of death?""<br />B: ""Only if I think about it so much. But death is inevitable, so there is no use thinking about it.""<br />A: ""How about horror movies?""<br />B: ""No. I know they're all fake so there is nothing to be afraid of. How about you?""<br />A: ""I get scared pretty easily. I'm actually frightened of bee's.""<br />B: ""Really? Why?""<br />A: ""I don't know. I got stung when I was young and ever since, I've always been afraid of them.""<br />B: ""What other things are you afraid of?""<br />A: ""Sitting by the camp fire and telling horror stories is very scary.""<br />B: ""Wow. You're afraid of many things huh?""<br />A: ""I guess so. Aren't you afraid of something coming out of the bushes?""<br />B: ""It's not going to happen. We probably went camping dozens of times and nothing ever came out of the bushes. What makes you think something will?""<br />A: ""I don't know. I guess I'm terrified at the possibility.""<br />B: ""If you were realistic, you probably wouldn't be scared of everything. Maybe you have too much imagination.""<br />A: ""I should try to think more realistically. I'll do that.""<br />B: ""Good. After awhile, you won't be afraid of so many things.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""How are you feeling these days?""<br />B: ""I don't know. A little bored and restless I guess.""<br />A: ""Why is that?""<br />B: ""I have so much time on my hands and I have nothing to do.""<br />A: ""Why don't you go out and have fun?""<br />B: ""I would like to, but I have to save some money so I can't go out all the time.""<br />A: ""That sucks.""<br />B: ""After awhile, I start to feel anxious.""<br />A: ""Try relaxing and reading a good book. That's always a good way to kill time.""<br />B: ""That's true. How about you? How are you these days?""<br />A: ""I'm doing pretty good these days. My kid just finished kindergarten. I'm so proud of him.""<br />B: ""That's great to hear. He must be big now. It's been a year since I saw your son.""<br />A: ""Yeah. He grew a lot in the last year.""<br />B: ""I bet you're very proud of your son.""<br />A: ""Yes I am. Thanks.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""What are you doing here on the bench? You've been here for an hour.""<br />B: ""I'm just thinking about Lucy. I can't get her out of my mind. I think I'm falling in love.""<br />A: ""Crazy boy. You barely know her.""<br />B: ""It doesn't matter. I like everything about her. I like the way she talks, the way she walks, her hair and her lips. I would give anything to kiss her.""<br />A: ""Did you tell her how you feel?""<br />B: ""No way. I'll scare her away.""<br />A: ""You won't know until you tell her.""<br />B: ""Maybe later. But right now, all I can think about is her legs and her face. She is so beautiful.""<br />A: ""You're wasting your time. At least talk to her. You don't have to tell her how you feel.""<br />B: ""Yeah. I started talking to her in my Poly Sci class. I try to sit next to her as much as I can.""<br />A: ""That's a start. After awhile, you'll find out if she is everything you make her out to be.""<br />B: ""It won't matter because I love everything she does.""<br />A: ""Dude, you're blind as a bat. You're just infatuated with her.""<br />B: ""These feelings are too strong to be infatuation.""<br />A: ""We'll see in a couple of weeks. Let's go grab something to eat. You're human aren't you?""<br />B: ""To think of it, I am a little hungry. Ok. Let's go.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Hi. Aren't you in my sociology class?""<br />B: ""I think so. With Professor Robinson right?""<br />A: ""Yeah. I'm Nicole.""<br />B: ""I'm George. It's nice to meet you.""<br />A: ""How are you liking the class so far?""<br />B: ""I like the subject. I think it's pretty interesting.""<br />A: ""Me too. But it's hard to sit in class when the weather is so nice.""<br />B: ""Tell me about it. The weather has been so great lately.""<br />A: ""So, what year are you?""<br />B: ""I'm a sophomore. How about you?""<br />A: ""I'm a freshman.""<br />B: ""Where are you from around here?""<br />A: ""No. I'm from the east. I grew up in New York.""<br />B: ""New York? That seems like a fun place.""<br />A: ""More like a busy place. Everyone is always on the run over there.""<br />B: ""I grew up in San Francisco.""<br />A: ""That's not too far from here. Do you like living on the west coast?""<br />B: ""I haven't been to many other places, but the west coast is a great place.""<br />A: ""Yeah. I like it too.""<br />B: ""Are you ready for the mid term next Friday?""<br />A: ""I'm so behind. I've been going out a lot. I'm having so much fun, but I really need to catch up on my school work.""<br />B: ""Where do you usually hang out?""<br />A: ""No where specific. We always do different things.""<br />B: ""Have you been to Alcatraz yet?""<br />A: ""Not yet. I want to go though.""<br />B: ""I highly recommend it. It's an interesting place to visit.""<br />A: ""Maybe you could take me there.""<br />B: ""If you get a B or better on your midterm, I'll take you there.""<br />A: ""Deal. It was great meeting you. I'll talk to you again tomorrow.""<br />B: ""Ok. See you later.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""I can't believe it took you so long to ask me out on a date.""<br />B: ""I always thought you liked Mark, so I didn't think I had a chance.""<br />A: ""I had this thing about him, but it's over. So, what do you like to do on your free time?""<br />B: ""I like sports, watching movies, reading books. Things like that.""<br />A: ""What type of movies do you like?""<br />B: ""I like drama and comedy.""<br />A: ""Me too. Mostly drama though. Have you seen Pay it forward?""<br />B: ""Yeah. I loved that movie.""<br />A: ""It's one of my favorites. I cried so much at the end.""<br />B: ""I thought the idea of paying it forward was awesome.""<br />A: ""What was your favorite comedy?""<br />B: ""Do you remember the Three Amigos?""<br />A: ""Vaguely. I was pretty little when that came out.""<br />B: ""I don't remember it much back then, but I saw it again the other day and it cracked me up.""<br />A: ""Maybe I need to see that movie again.""<br />B: ""I think it is a classic. So many funny scenes.""<br />A: ""I really liked the Mask with Jim Carrey.""<br />B: ""He is hilarious. I love that guy.""<br />A: ""I like most of his movies. He is such a character.""<br />B: ""What else do you like to do?""<br />A: ""Well, I like to exercise.""<br />B: ""Where do you exercise?""<br />A: ""I go to a health club by my house. But on a nice day, I like to jog around the lake.""<br />B: ""That's good. I like to stay in shape too. But I do that by playing a lot of sports. Do you play any sports?""<br />A: ""I played a little bit in high school, but nothing really these days.""<br />B: ""Have you tried golf?""<br />A: ""Don't start with that. My dad always nagged at me to play, but I never got into it.""<br />B: ""What do you usually do with your friends?""<br />A: ""We go out shopping a lot.""<br />B: ""Where do you usually go?""<br />A: ""Usually downtown. It's more fun in the city than in the mall. Plus, there are too many high school students at the mall.""<br />B: ""I know some girls like bags, and some like shoes, what do you like to shop for the most?""<br />A: ""I can never have too many pairs of shoes. I have like 30 pairs already, but I am always shopping for more.""<br />B: ""Oh. The foods here.""<br />A: ""Great. I'm so hungry.""<br />B: ""After dinner, do you want to catch a movie?""<br />A: ""Sure. I'm always up for a good movie.""<br />"
"<br />A: ""Damn Mark. I never noticed that belly of yours.""<br />B: ""It's all the beer. I need to start working out again.""<br />A: ""That reminds me. I should've hit the gym today.""<br />B: ""Where do you work out?""<br />A: ""At Bally's. It's pretty close to home so it is convenient.""<br />B: ""How much are you paying?""<br />A: ""I only pay 20 bucks a month.""<br />B: ""That's pretty good. I think I should join.""<br />A: ""If you join, we could work out together. It's so much better working out with another person. It's hard to motivate yourself when you are alone.""<br />B: ""What do you usually do in the gym?""<br />A: ""I usually spend about 20 minutes on the step master, and then lift weights for about an hour.""<br />B: ""Do you go everyday?""<br />A: ""No. I try to go 4 times a week, but lately, I've been only going about 2 times a week. That's why I need you there. You should join.""<br />B: ""Will it help me to get some girls?""<br />A: ""If you get rid of that belly of yours, I promise you'll have a better chance with girls. Anyways, there are so many fine chicks working out at the club.""<br />B: ""Really? I'm signing up tomorrow.""<br />A: ""There are some girls with tight outfits. You can see the shape of their body and some of them are really fine.""<br />B: ""As long as there are some ladies with nice legs, I don't mind.""<br />A: ""So you're really going to join?""<br />B: ""Yeah. Let's go in tomorrow and I'll sign up. We can work out together.""<br />A: ""Cool. Let's go hit some bars to celebrate.""<br />B: ""I'm down with that.""<br />"
