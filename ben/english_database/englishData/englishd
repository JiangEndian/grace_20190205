"<i>Adverb</i> or <i>adjective</i>?| ..."	"<h2>Adverb or adjective?</h2><p>It's important to remember to use an adjective after a linking verb. However, this can be tricky as some verbs can be used as both normal verbs and as linking verbs. One test is to replace the verb with the same form of 'be' and see if the sentence still makes sense. If it does, the verb is being used as a linking verb and so needs an adjective, not an adverb.</p><blockquote>- He smells the hot soup carefully. (Here we are talking about the action of smelling and using smell as a normal verb, so we need an adverb.)</blockquote><blockquote>- The soup smells good. (Here we are using 'smell' as a linking verb, to describe the soup. We can replace 'smells' with 'is' and the sentence still makes sense. So, we need an adjective.)</blockquote><blockquote>- He looked tiredly at the dirty kitchen. (Here we are talking about the action of looking and using 'look' as a normal verb, so we use an adverb to describe the way of looking.)</blockquote><blockquote>- You look beautiful.

"Comma with Subjects and Verbs|  "	"<p>A comma shouldn’t separate a subject from its verb. Separating the subject and its verb with a comma is a mistake generally made if the subject clause is long, and if the subject already has a verb in it (as part of a relative clause),</p><blockquote><p><i>The things which cause me joy<b>,</b> may also cause me pain.</i></p></blockquote><p>The subject of this sentence is the things which cause me joy, and its verb is may cause. Not only does this comma separate the verb from its subject, but the comma isn’t even required for clarity. We should definitely get rid of this comma.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The method of ensuring you are driving on the right route<b>,</b> is to check your G.P.S.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>We don’t need a comma in this sentence, either.</p><p><b>Exception:</b> The only time you may separate a subject from its verb is if the verb from the subject clause is repeated.</p><blockquote><p><i>He who offends me<b>,</b> offends me greatly.</i></p></blockquote><p>If we didn’t have the comma in this sentence, the reader might sound like a broken record.

"Comma Between Two Nouns in a Compound Subject or Object|  "	"<p>Don’t separate two nouns in a compound subject, or two objects, with a comma. There can be more than one subject or object in a sentence.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The twins<b>,</b> and their mother went shopping for shoes for school.</font><i></p></blockquote><p>The compound subject of this sentence is the twins and their mother. By putting a comma after twins, we’re separating twins from its modifying verb went shopping.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>You can give the books to Mark<b>,</b> or Michael.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The comma in this sentence separates the compound object Mark and Michael. Just as with the previous sentence, this comma separates Michael from his modifying verb.</p><blockquote><font color='red'><i><p>The twins and their mother went shopping for shoes<b>,</b> and clothes for school.</p><p>You can give the books<b>,</b> and papers<b>,</b> to Mark or Michael.</p><p>You<b>,</b> and I<b>,</b> need to go shopping for shoes and clothes for school.</p></i></font></blockquote><p>None of these sentences requires a comma.</p>"
"Comma Between Two Verbs in a Compound Predicate |  "	"<p>Don’t put a comma between two verbs in a compound predicate.

"Comma Splice|  "	"<p>If two independent clauses are to be joined into one sentence, they should be separated by a conjunction or a semi-colon, or possibly even a conjunction and a comma. They can also be separated into two sentences by a period. Using a comma causes a comma splice.</p><blockquote><font color='red'><i><p>Koala bears are not actually bears<b>,</b> they are marsupials.</p><p>I am not angry with you<b>,</b> I am not happy with you, either.</p><p>I’m thinking of skipping English class<b>,</b> it’s really boring.</p></i></font></blockquote><p><b>Exceptions:</b> Comma splices can be used for artistic or poetic effect, as when one is connecting several short independent clauses. Don’t do this in a formal composition, though; it’s only for creative writing. (If you’re going to pull this off in formal writing, try using a semi-colon.)</p><blockquote><p><i>She was beautiful<b>,</b> she was gorgeous, she was ravishing.</i></p></blockquote><p>Comma splices may also be used if the two independent clauses are somehow contrasting, as when following a statement with a question.</p><blockquote><p><i>You are coming to the party<b>,</b> aren’t you?</i></p></blockquote>"
"Comma After Introductory Clauses |  "	"<p>Introductory clauses are dependent clauses which are found at the beginning of the sentence (although they can be moved to the end of the sentence, too, without confusing the meaning of the sentence). After a dependent introductory clause, we use a comma to separate the introductory clause from the independent clause. The dependent introductory clause may start with an adverb or conjunction like <i>although, if</i>, or <i>when</i>.</p><blockquote><i><p>As the man was walking into the store<b>,</b> he came face-to-face with his childhood sweetheart.</p><p>Because the rain was torrential<b>,</b> the day’s Little League games were postponed.</p><p>Grabbing her umbrella<b>,</b> Kate raced out of the house.</p><p>Now then<b>,</b> we should head back home because the baby needs a nap.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Comma After Conjunction in Introductory Clause|  "	"<p>Introductory clauses frequently begin with a conjunction (<i>although, since, when, if</i>, etc.) There should be no comma after the conjunction in the introductory clause.</p><blockquote><p><i>Because<b>,</b> it was going to rain<b>,</b> we cancelled the picnic.</i></p></blockquote><p>The comma after <i>because</i> should be removed; the comma after <i>rain</i> is properly used as it separates the introductory clause from the independent clause.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'><p>After<b>,</b> flunking her Victorian Literature class<b>,</b> Martha decided to do the assigned reading.</p><p>When and if<b>,</b> it gets delivered<b>,</b> please bring the package into my office immediately.</p><p>So<b>,</b> that the water didn’t get in<b>,</b> we attached rubber seals around the windows.</p></font></i></blockquote>"
"Missing Comma After Introductory Clause With Date|  "	"<p>Dependent introductory clauses which include a date should be offset by a comma. The date can be a year or the date of the month.</p><blockquote><i><p>In 1989<b>,</b> he graduated from high school.</p><p>By the 1960s<b>,</b> most households had a television set.</p><p>During the 1800s<b>,</b> canned foods were becoming popular.</p><p>Since November 15th<b>,</b> we’ve raised more than a thousand dollars for charity.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Commas After Introductory Phrases|  "	"<p>An introductory phrase is like a clause, but it doesn’t have its own subject and verb; it relies on the subject and verb in the main clause. Unless the phrase is very short (fewer than 5 words) and begins with a preposition (<i>to, for, at,</i> etc.), there should be a comma between the introductory phrase and the main clause. You can use your own judgment here: if you were saying the sentence out loud, would you pause after the introductory phrase?</p><blockquote><i><p>Fighting against reason<b>,</b> Martha decided to pull an all-nighter in hopes of passing the exam.</p><p>Without understanding why<b>,</b> Annie woke from a deep sleep with an urge to check on her children.</p><p>Between March and April<b>,</b> the little boy grew three inches.</p><p>By flashlight we made our way along the path.</p></i></blockquote><p>Because the introductory phrase by <i>flashlight</i> is short and begins with a preposition, a comma is not required; regardless, it wouldn’t be considered incorrect if there were a comma after flashlight.</p>"
"Commas After Introductory Words|  "	"<p>After an introductory word, we use a comma to separate the introductory word from the independent clause. The introductory word in the sentence will frequently be an adverb.</p><blockquote><i><p>Meanwhile<b>,</b> the cat stretched luxuriously in the sunshine.</p><p>Furthermore<b>,</b> the educational institution will prosecute those individuals who plagiarise the institution’s written works.</p><p>Suddenly<b>,</b> an angry black cat sprang from the shadows.</p></i></blockquote><blockquote><i><p>Quickly<b>,</b> she grabbed the fire extinguisher and doused the flames.</p><p>Unfortunately<b>,</b> our elderly neighbour has had to move into a nursing home.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Comma Within a Comparison|  "	"<p>A comma shouldn’t be used within a comparison (unless there is a non-restrictive clause). Writers will sometimes put a comma before a conjunction as this is where speakers will naturally pause for emphasis; when writing, the pause is considered grammatically incorrect. </p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>This box is lighter<b>,</b> than that box.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The comma after <i>lighter</i> should be removed so it does not separate the two items – the boxes – which are being compared.</p><blockquote><font color='red'><i><p>The box containing the hardcover books is really quite heavy<b>,</b> while the box containing the paperbacks is relatively light.</p><p>Hardcover books weigh more<b>,</b> than paperback books.</p></i></font></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The box on the table<b>,</b> which contains the hardcover books<b>,</b> is really quite heavy while the box containing the paperbacks is relatively light.</i></p></blockquote><p>This sentence is correct because the commas are being used around the non-restrictive clause <i>which contains the hardcover books</i>.</p>"
"Comma Use Around Interrupters|  "	"<p>Interrupters are little thoughts in the middle of a thought, added to show emotion, tone or emphasis. When we use an interrupter in the middle of the sentence, it should be emphasized with commas. Without the use of commas, the flow of the sentence may be awkward for the reader. Interrupters are easily identified by saying the sentence out loud; you’ll naturally pause where the commas should be.</p><blockquote><p><i>Queen Victoria was, as they say, a formidable woman.</i></p></blockquote><p>The interrupter <i>as they say</i> needs a comma before and after it to emphasise its separation from the rest of the sentence.</p><blockquote><i><p>Having demonstrated a decided lack of ethics<b>,</b> the CEO was<b>,</b> needless to say<b>,</b> dismissed from the company.</p><p>It does<b>,</b> indeed<b>,</b> look like rain.</p></i></blockquote><p>Names can also be interrupters.</p><blockquote><i><p>What<b>,</b> Susan<b>,</b> do you think?</p><p>Now<b>,</b> where do you suppose<b>,</b> Davey<b>,</b> your shoes might have gone this time?</p></i></blockquote><p>Here are some more common interrupters: <i>in fact, to say the least, however, generally speaking, sadly, happily,</i> and <i>unfortunately</i>.</p>"
"Run-on Sentences|  "	"<p>When two independent clauses are joined by a co-ordinating conjunction (e.g. <i>and, but, or, so</i>), there must be a comma before the conjunction, or it will be a run-on sentence. Independent clauses are complete sentences; if you could put a period after the clause but have instead used just a conjunction, then you’ve created a run-on sentence.</p><blockquote><i><p>Matthew went to the library<b>,</b> and I headed back to the science lab.</p><p>The wind was brisk<b>,</b> but the sun was strong.</p><p>The man’s business was failing<b>,</b> so he was searching for alternative income.</p><p>Anna went to make a strong cup of coffee<b>,</b> for she was falling asleep at her desk.</p><p>The paintings were striking<b>,</b> yet they were also pleasant to look at.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Missing Comma Before a Question Tag|  "	"<p>When we have a statement which we want someone to agree with, we add a few words on the end, turning it into a question. These few words are called <i>question tags</i>. These are words like <i>isn’t it/he/she,</i> or <i>right</i>, or even <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>. These question tags should be separated from the main clause by a comma.</p><blockquote><p><i>The citizens of the world all want clean water do drink<b>,</b> do they not?</i></p></blockquote><p><b>Do they not</b> is a question tag. It needs to be separated from the statement by a comma.</p><blockquote><i><p>Legends about werewolves<b>,</b> vampire and other monsters from are considered to be some of the scariest stories around<b>,</b> no?</p><p>Those willow trees are beautiful<b>,</b> aren’t they?</p><p>That movie was really good<b>,</b> yeah?</p></i></blockquote><p>Sometimes there will be a linguistically unintelligible question tag. These tend to differ from country to country. These are not likely to be used in formal writing, but they should still be considered when writing informally. Here’s an example that is purely Canadian:</p><blockquote><p><i>Do you wanna go snowboarding today<b>,</b> eh?</i></p></blockquote>"
"Punctuation of Appositives|  "	"<p>An appositive is a noun or pronoun (perhaps with some adjectives, etc.) which adds extra information to clarify a noun in the sentence. Take this sentence, for instance: <i>My mom Angela is a good cook</i>. <i>Angela</i> is the appositive for <i>mom</i>. If the appositive is <b>not necessary</b> to understand the sentence, there should be commas around the appositive. If the appositive <b>is necessary</b> to understand the sentence, don’t put commas around it.</p><blockquote><p><i>A brilliant young painter<b>,</b> the artist was given his own show at the age of 19.</i></p></blockquote><p>The appositive a <i>brilliant young painter</i> isn’t required to understand this sentence; there should be a comma after <i>painter</i> (but not at the beginning of the appositive, as it is at the beginning of the sentence).</p><blockquote><i><p>The rose<b>,</b> a deep red blood drop<b>,</b> stood out amongst the tiny white flowers.</p><p>Martha<b>,</b> yawning with exhaustion<b>,</b> sat down at her desk to finish her last paper.</p></i></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The professor<b>,</b> Dr. Kendrick<b>,</b> was a wonderful teacher.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The appositive <b>Dr. Kendrick</b>, is necessary in order to understand which professor was a wonderful teacher, so there is no need for commas around it.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'><p>Please hand me the paper<b>,</b> that is on the table.</p><p>The red car<b>,</b> with the flat tire<b>,</b> is pulled over to the side of the road.</p></font></i></blockquote>"
"Comma in Dates|  "	"<p>When writing a date, a comma is used to separate the day from the month, and the date from the year.</p><blockquote><i><p>The American Declaration of Independence was ratified on July 4<b>,</b> 1776.</p><p>I was born on Sunday<b>,</b> May 12<b>,</b> 1968.</p><p>On Tuesday<b>,</b> April 13th at three o’clock<b>,</b> there will be a meeting for all staff.</p><p>Please join us on Saturday<b>,</b> June 14th<b>,</b> 2010<b>,</b> for the marriage of Annie and Michael.</p></i></blockquote><p><b>Enception:</b></p><blockquote><p><i>The application is to be finished by 31 December 2009.</i></p></blockquote><p>Although inappropriate for use in formal writing, this format does not require any commas.</p>"
"Comma Between Coordinate Adjectives|  "	"<p>When one has several coordinate adjectives (i.e. a list of adjectives which do not have to be in any particular order), a comma is used to separate them. This is done for clarity and emphasis.</p><blockquote><i><p>That man is a pompous<b>,</b> self-righteous<b>,</b> annoying idiot.</p><p>That man is a self-righteous<b>,</b> annoying<b>,</b> pompous idiot.</p><p>The sweet<b>,</b> scintillating aroma of cinnamon buns filled the kitchen.</p><p>The scintillating<b>,</b> sweet aroma of cinnamon buns filled the kitchen.</p></i></blockquote><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The adorable<b>,</b> little boy was eating ice cream.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>In English, we usually put <i>little</i> and boy together, so the two adjectives (<i>adorable</i> and <i>little</i>) do not require a comma between them.</p>"
"Unnecessary Comma in a Complex Sentence|  "	"<p>Complex sentences are sentences which have two clauses. There can be two independent clauses (each having a subject and predicate), or an independent clause and a dependent clause (missing a subject or predicate). Generally, if the dependent clause comes second, a comma is not used before the dependent clause. Frequently, but not always, a conjunction will begin the dependent clause.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>I need to do the shopping<b>,</b> because there is nothing to eat in the house.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The second clause, <i>because there is nothing to eat in the house</i>, is dependent; there is no need to use a comma between the two clauses.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'><p>It makes no sense to study Advanced Pure Math<b>,</b> if the student will not use the math at a later date.</p><p>I’ll put the book down and sleep<b>,</b> when I can no longer keep my eyes open. </p></font></i></blockquote><p>We don’t need a comma in these sentences, either.</p><p><b>Exception:</b> If the sentence is too long or confusing without a comma, one may be used for purposes of clarity.</p><blockquote><p><i>In the background of the painting there are a boat, a river, and a sunset, which attract the viewer’s attention.</i></p></blockquote><p>Here, a comma is used before the dependent clause because otherwise the reader may think only the sunset attracts the viewer’s attention.</p>"
"Comma Between Compound Subject and Predicate|  "	"<p>A compound subject is a subject which lists more than one thing. Commas may be used within the compound subject to separate the nouns, but should not be used between the subject and the predicate of the sentence.</p><blockquote><p><i>Some frequent causes of headaches are<b>,</b> stress<b>,</b> lack of exercise and dehydration.</i></p></blockquote><p>The comma between <i>are</i> and <i>stress</i> should be removed because it separates the predicate from the subject. The other comma is grammatically correct.</p><blockquote><font color='red'><i><p>Literacy and good writing skills<b>,</b> are necessary in most careers.</p><p>Time and space<b>,</b> are fascinating fields of study.</p></i></font></blockquote>"
"Comma Before <b>And</b>|  "	"<p>If there are only two things in a list, they do not need to be separated by a comma. If there are more than two ideas, the comma should be used as it would in a list.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The purpose of a comma is to clarify lists<b>,</b> and conjoin ideas.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The compound predicate, <i>is to clarify lists and conjoin ideas</i>, does not require a comma. The comma should be removed.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The dog is young but well-trained<b>,</b> and good-natured.</font></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>The dog is young<b>,</b> well-trained, and good-natured.</i></p></blockquote><p>The comma in the last sentence is correctly placed as it is being used to clarify the elements in a list.</p><p>A comma should also be placed before and if and is at the beginning of an independent clause.</p><blockquote><i><p>The purpose of a comma is to clarify list, and it also conjoins ideas.</p><p>The dog is young<b>,</b> and it’s also well-trained.</p><p>It’s cold outside<b>,</b> and I can’t find my coat.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Comma Before <b>But</b>|  "	"<p>A comma should be placed before the word but only if but is at the beginning of an independent clause.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>I would go for a walk<b>,</b> but for the rain.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>In this sentence, <i>but</i> is being used to mean <i>except</i>. Because but isn’t starting an independent clause, the comma isn’t required.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'><p>The dog is young<b>,</b> but well-trained.</p><p>Grammar is boring<b>,</b> but necessary.</p></font></i></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>I would go for a walk<b>,</b> but it’s raining outside.</i></p></blockquote><p>Because it’s at the beginning of an independent clause, the comma before but is necessary.</p><blockquote><i><p>The dog is young<b>,</b> but he’s well-trained.</p><p>Grammar is boring<b>,</b> but it’s necessary.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Missing Comma In A List |  "	"<p>When creating a list of two or more things, commas should be used to separate each category in the list. There is no formula for this: you must use logic and reason to understand the categories. Some sentences use several verbs, so the commas will separate the items which belong to a different verb. Some items can be separated by adjectives. Frequently, errors of this nature occur between the last two items, so look before the <i>and</i></p><p><b>N.B.</b> American English requires the use of a comma before the last and in a list; British English does not. Be sure to follow local protocol, particularly in formal writing.</p><blockquote><p><i>I cleaned the house and the garage<b>,</b> raked the lawn<b>,</b> and took out the garbage.</i></p></blockquote><p>The list in this sentence categorises items by verb. Without the comma after and, readers would be looking for another item which was being raked: <i>I…raked the lawn and ___</i>.</p><blockquote><p><i>Mary bought the shirt in red<b>,</b> purple, and black.</i></p></blockquote><p>This sentence doesn’t need a comma before the and because the three colours refer to the shirt Mary bought. The final comma should be removed.</p><blockquote><p><i>For the bouquet of roses<b>,</b> I selected three red ones, three white ones, and two black ones.</i></p></blockquote><p>Here, the categories are being defined by the numbers and colours of roses. Because <i>two black ones</i> is a different category than <i>three white ones</i>, we need the comma before the and.</p>"
"Serial Comma (Within List Of Similar Elements)|  "	"<p>When creating a list or series of multiple things which are similar, commas should be used to separate each item in the list. </p><p><b>N.B.</b> American English requires the use of a comma before the last and in a list; British English does not. Be sure to follow local protocol, particularly in formal writing.</p><blockquote><p><i>Teenagers are often anxious to grow up<b>,</b> get a job<b>,</b> and move out of their parents’ house.</i></p></blockquote><p>If you look carefully, there are three things teenagers want to do: 1) grow up, 2) get a job, and 3) move out of their parents’ house. These are similar things (they’re all things teenagers are anxious to do), so we need both commas.</p><blockquote><i><p>I still have to buy a gift<b>,</b> pack the suitcases<b>,</b> and arrange for someone to water the plants while we’re at the wedding.</p><p>Mary needs bread<b>,</b> milk<b>,</b> and butter at the grocery store.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Comma Separating Verb And Its Object|  "	"<p>A verb should not be separated from its object (the thing or person which is receiving the verb). To figure out what the object of the sentence is, ask yourself this: what is the subject doing? Let’s look at the sentence, <i>Mary likes chocolate</i>. The verb is <i>likes</i>, so we would ask, <i>What does Mary like?</i> She likes chocolate, so the object of the verb is <i>chocolate</i>. Now that we can identify the verb and the object in the sentence, we know not to put a comma between them.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>Mary said<b>,</b> she likes chocolate.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>This comma separates Mary from the thing she said.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The teacher claimed<b>,</b> she was too busy to help her students outside of class.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The verb is <i>claimed</i> and its object is <i>she was too busy to help her students</i>; the comma between them shouldn’t be there.</p><blockquote><p><i>After finding her classes’ grades were slipping<b>,</b> the teacher decided to stay, for an extra hour after school each day.</i></p></blockquote>"
"Comma Setting Off Non-restrictive Clauses|  "	"<p>A <b>non-restrictive</b> clause is a clause which may offer more information, but doesn’t limit the subject; this might be something of interest, such as how old something is or a job a person has. A non-restrictive clause may use the word <i>which</i> and can be removed from the sentence without loss of understanding.</p><p>Non-restrictive clauses are generally separated from the rest of the sentence by commas (while restrictive clauses are not).</p><blockquote><p><i>That box of apples<b>,</b> which I picked this morning, can be used to make the pie.</i></p></blockquote><p>The non-restrictive clause <i>which I picked this morning</i> needs to have a comma on either side of it because this information is not required to identify the box; <i>that</i> is the word which identifies the box (we can  assume the speaker is pointing to it).</p><blockquote><p><i>Three years ago<b>,</b> the house on the corner<b>,</b> which was of historical interest<b>,</b> was torn down.</i></p></blockquote><p>As the house is already identified as the one on the corner, the fact that it was of historical interest is not necessary.</p>"
"Comma Setting Off Restrictive Clauses|  "	"<p>A <b>restrictive clause</b> is a clause which limits a subject; this might be something identifying, such as the colour of a person’s hair, or the position of a book on a table. A restrictive clause may use the word that, and cannot be removed from the sentence without loss of information.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The box of apples, that has the red label on it<b>,</b> can be used to make the pie.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The restrictive clause <b>that has the red label on it</b> should not have a comma on either side of it. The label is required to identify the box.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'><p>Three years ago<b>,</b> the house<b>,</b> on the corner<b>,</b> was torn down.</p><p>The plants<b>,</b> that are wilting<b>,</b> need more water.</p></font></i></blockquote>"
"Comma Between Correlative Conjunction Sets|  "	"<p>Correlative pairs of conjunctions include words like <i>neither...nor, not…but</i>, and <i>both…and</i>. For this punctuation rule, we can also consider sets of words like <i>not only…but also</i>. When pairs or sets of conjunctions are being used, they do not need to be separated from each other by a comma. However, a comma may be used between the conjunctions to accommodate another grammar rule (see <b>Exceptions</b>).</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>Either the blue shirt<b>,</b> or the red sweater will look good with your jeans.</font></i></p></blockquote><p><b>Either…or</b> is a correlative pair of conjunctions. The comma should be removed from this sentence so the conjunctions are not separated from each other.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>I can’t decide whether to have pizza<b>,</b> or a cheeseburger.</font></i></p></blockquote><p><b>Exception:</b> If two commas are around a non-restrictive clause, they may be used between the correlative pairs of conjunctions.</p><blockquote><p><i>Neither the job as a cashier, which only paid minimum wage<b>,</b> nor the washroom attendant’s job interested the woman with two PhDs.</i></p></blockquote>"
"Comma Emphasizing Contrasting Ideas With Commas|  "	"<p>A group of words which offers a contrast to the subject of the sentence may need to have a comma on either side to separate it from the main idea. Look for words such as <i>not, unlike</i> and <i>never</i>; these signify a contrasting idea. By putting a comma on either side, the contrasting idea is made clear to the reader, and the subject is clearly modified.</p><blockquote><i><p>Mary<b>,</b> unlike Ann<b>,</b> is very organised.</p><p>Tea should be steeped<b>,</b> never boiled.</p><p>Most people will continue wanting<b>,</b> but rarely needing, more and more material objects.</p><p>Ice hockey<b>,</b> not road hockey<b>,</b> is a good winter sport.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Comma Between Direct Quote and Attributive Tag|  "	"<p>When quoting, it must be made clear to the reader who said (or wrote or thought) whatever is being quoted; this is done by using “attributive tags”. Look for words like <i>he said, he claimed</i> and <i>according to</i>. Attributive tags can be at the beginning or end of the quote, or even in the middle (in which case you would use a comma before and after the attributive tag). American convention generally places commas <b>outside</b> opening quotation marks and <b>inside</b> closing quotation marks.</p><blockquote><i><p>At the end of the class the professor remarked<b>,</b> “How attentive you have been today!”</p><p>“There is a problem<b>,</b>” the head caretaker agrees<b>,</b> “with the storage of garbage between pickups.</p><p>“You have ice cream on your nose<b>,</b>” my friend snickered.</p><p>“When you leave the house<b>,</b>” my mother yelled<b>,</b> “don’t slam the door!”</p></i></blockquote>"
"Comma After Question Mark|  "	"<p>We usually use a comma to separate a quote from an attributive tag (e.g. he thought, said <i>he</i>), even if the quote would usually end in a period. However, if the quote is a question, a question mark needs to be used in order to show the reader that the sentence is a question. </p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>“Do you want to come to the movies with us?”<b>,</b> Mary asked.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The comma between the quote and the attributive tag is not required, and should be removed.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>“I am trying to sleep here!”<b>,</b> my roommate yelled.</font></i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>My roommate yelled<b>,</b> “I am trying to sleep here!”</i></p></blockquote><p>This last sentence is correctly punctuated because the attributive tag is at the beginning of the sentence; the comma is used to separate the attributive tag from the beginning of the quote so there is no conflict between two punctuation marks.</p>"
"Comma Inside Quotation Marks|  "	"<p>In American English, commas from a quote always go inside the quotation marks.</p><blockquote><i><p>“Pass me that thesaurus,” said Matthew.</p><p>“If you knew what was good for you, you’d sit down and finish that essay right now,” my roommate said.</p><p>“We’re going down to the soup kitchen to help serve dinner,” her mother called.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Comma Before Parenthesis|  "	"<p>Parentheses are used to give additional information to the reader: information which is not required and which would disrupt the flow of the sentence if written as a non-restrictive clause. Commas may be placed after the closing parenthesis but not before either the opening or the closing parenthesis. If the sentence would not require any commas if the parentheses were removed, the sentence should not have any commas when the parentheses are added.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>After opening the new cookie tin<b>,</b> (and eating several of the cookies)<b>,</b> Mary had a hard time replacing the lid.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The comma after tin should be removed. The comma <b>after</b> the closing parenthesis is correctly used as it separates a dependent clause (<i>after opening the new cookie tin</i>) from an independent clause (<i>Mary had a hard time replacing the lid</i>).</p><blockquote><i><p><font color='red'>After opening the new cookie tin (and eating several of the cookies<b>,</b>) Mary had a hard time replacing the lid.</font></p><p>After opening the new cookie tin (and eating several of the cookies)<b>,</b> Mary had a hard time replacing the lid.</p><p><font color='red'>Peter cleaned his room<b>,</b> (grumbling all the while<b>,</b>) before going out to play basketball.</font></p></i></blockquote><p>This sentence does not require any commas; both should be removed.</p></blockquote>"
"Comma between an article and its noun|  "	"<p>Commas are used to separate thoughts or ideas, or to tell the reader when to pause. Articles are used to refer to a noun, so the article can’t really be a separated from the noun as it’s all part of the same idea. The articles in English are <i>the, a</i> and <i>an</i>. Nouns are a person, place or thing.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The company managers accidentally scheduled the<b>,</b> weekly meeting for Saturday.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The comma between <b>the</b> and <b>weekly</b> should be removed because it separates the article <b>the</b> from the noun <b>meeting</b>.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'><p>A<b>,</b> bouquet of flowers may be created using more than one type of flower.</p><p>I’ll have an<b>,</b> apple.</p></font></i></blockquote><p>When speaking, we will often pause while we think of the next word. While a speaker may pause after an article, it is not a grammatically correct pause; when written down, there should be no comma after <i>an</i>. Generally, this example will not come up in formal writing but if it should, the pause can be indicated with an ellipsis: <i>I’ll have an… apple</i>.</p>"
"Oxford Comma|  "	"<p>Originally used by Oxford University Press, this is the comma which is used before <i>and</i> in a list. British English doesn’t use the Oxford comma. It certainly has its purpose when used to eliminate confusion, but it is used consistently – whether it’s required for clarity or not.</p><p>American English insists on the use of the Oxford comma.</p><blockquote><i><p>The American flag is red<b>,</b> white<b>,</b> and blue.</p><p>Margaret<b>,</b> Martha<b>,</b> and Martin went to the movies.</p><p>The cat leapt onto the chair<b>,</b> turned around several times<b>,</b> and curled himself into a small ball with his tail over his nose.</p></i></blockquote>"
"<b>As well as</b> Comma| "	"<p>The phrase <i>as well as</i> creates one of those situations where you may have to make a judgment call about comma usage. As a general rule, it doesn’t need a comma before it unless it’s a part of a non-restrictive clause.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>Please proofread for spelling mistakes<b>,</b> as well as grammatical errors.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>This sentence doesn’t require a comma.</p><blockquote><p><i>Spelling mistakes<b>,</b> as well as grammatical errors, are distracting to a reader.</i></p></blockquote><p>This sentence does require the commas around the non-restrictive clause.</p><blockquote><i><p>I like carrot cake<b>,</b> as well as chocolate cake.</p><p>I like carrot cake as well as chocolate cake.</p></i></blockquote><p>Both sentences clearly mean that I like both kinds of cake; the comma use is probably not necessary. We’d probably only use the comma in the second sentence if we were writing dialogue and wanted to show where the speaker paused.</p><blockquote><p><i>I like carrot cake as well as chocolate cake, but lemon cake is my favourite.</i></p></blockquote><p>This sentence doesn’t need a comma in front of as well as; the meaning is quite clear.</p><blockquote><i><p>I don’t like carrot cake as well as chocolate cake.</p><p>I don’t like carrot cake, as well as chocolate cake.</p></i></blockquote><p>These sentences clearly demonstrate where a judgment call is required. The first sentence means that I prefer chocolate cake. The second sentence means that I don’t like either of them.</p>"
"<b>Such as</b> Comma|  "	"<p>The phrase such as only requires a comma in front of it if it’s part of a non-restrictive clause.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>There are many different types of coniferous trees<b>,</b> such as pine and spruce.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>The comma in this sentence isn’t necessary, as it’s only giving examples</p><blockquote><i><p>The Grade 5 class studied ancient cultures such as Greece and Rome.</p><p>Fresh fruit provides many nutrients such as vitamin C.</p></i></blockquote><p>Neither of the above sentences requires a comma.</p><blockquote><i><p>The Grade 5 class studied ancient cultures<b>,</b> such as Greece and Rome<b>,</b> before they studied different forms of government.</p><p>Fresh fruit provides many nutrients<b>,</b> such as vitamin C<b>,</b> and tastes good too.</p></i></blockquote><p>These two sentences require the commas because such as is part of the non-restrictive clauses.</p>"
"Comma Before <b>Too</b>|  "	"<p>When using the word <i>too</i>, you only need to use a comma before it for emphasis.</p><blockquote><p><i>I<b>,</b> too<b>,</b> like bananas.</i></p></blockquote><p>You can tell by the position of <i>too</i> that emphasis is required in this sentence, so we use the commas to offset it.</p><blockquote><i><p>Mike wanted to go to the party<b>,</b> too<b>,</b> so he shut down his computer.</p><p><font color='red'>I like bananas<b>,</b> too.</font></p></i></blockquote><p>This sentence doesn’t need a comma.</p><blockquote><p><i>Read this book, and this one too.</i></p></blockquote>"
"Colon Use|  "	"<p>Colons are used to make lists,</p><blockquote><i><p>Don’t forget<b>:</b> clean the kitchen, do the shopping, and bathe the dog.</p><p>Here’s the grocery list<b>:</b> eggs, milk, juice, bread, and fruit.</p><p>To do<b>:</b> English essay, math homework, and write that thank-you note to Grandma.</p><p>People often abuse punctuation; for examples: commas, apostrophes and hyphens.</p></i></blockquote><p>or to separate one idea from the one which follows. </p><blockquote><i><p>I know what to do with that cake<b>:</b> eat it.</p><p>A colon is used to separate the hour from the minutes<b>:</b> 8:15.</p><p>I’m soaking wet<b>:</b> I forgot my umbrella.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Colon Between Independent Clauses|  "	"<p>A colon can be used to separate two independent clauses when a) the second clause is <i>directly</i> related to the first clause (not just vaguely related) and b) when the emphasis is on the second clause. While you can also use a semi-colon or a period between two independent-yet-related clauses, the colon is a little softer than the period, but a little harder than the semi-colon.</p><p>In British English, the first letter after the colon is only capitalized if it’s a proper noun or an acronym; in American English, the convention depends on the format but it’s frequently capitalized. If your writing must follow a specific format, check the rules for that format before capitalizing (if in doubt, it might be safer to use the lower case).</p><blockquote><i><p>It’s been snowing for three days straight<b>:</b> The roads around here aren’t very safe for driving.</p><p>Maggie wears a brimmed cap at all times<b>:</b> Strong light often gives her a headache.</p><p>I’m looking for a copy of Wind in the Willows<b>:</b> one of my students wants to read it.</p><p>The library is very quiet tonight<b>:</b> I’ll get a lot of work done.</p><p>My niece is the star of the show this evening<b>:</b> she’s the one in the pink tutu.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Colon With Independent Clause Followed By A List, A Quotation,  Appositive, Or Other Idea Directly Related To The Independent Clause|  "	"<p>An independent clause is followed by a colon if the dependent clause is <i>directly</i> related to the independent clause. The dependent clause should clarify or give more information about the independent clause. The beginning of the dependent clause shouldn’t be capitalized unless it begins with a proper noun or an acronym, or it’s a quote which originally began with a capital.</p><blockquote><i><p>We have everything we need for the baby<b>:</b> diapers, sleepers, toys, bottles and pacifiers.</p><p>The teacher spoke firmly to her students<b>:</b> “Please do not throw paper airplanes or spitballs at the back of my head!”</p><p>There is a cure for all your ills<b>:</b> chocolate.</p><p>Bring something for Grandma<b>:</b> flowers or perfume or the likes.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Other Uses Of Colon|  "	"<p>We also use a colon to separate hours, minutes and seconds when recording the time.</p><blockquote><i><p>Come over around 8<b>:</b>15.</p><p>Mary was gone by 9<b>:</b>00 p.m.</p><p>The timer is set for 16<b>:</b>30<b>:</b>15.</p></i></blockquote><p>In literature, it can be used to separate chapters and verses, or acts and scenes.</p><blockquote><i><p>Turn to III<b>:</b> iv in the play.</p><p>A famous Bible passage is Luke 2<b>:</b>16.</p></i></blockquote><p>Commas can be used to identify the name of the speaker in a lengthy section of dialogue such as in a play.</p><blockquote><i><p>Martin<b>:</b> Where have you been?</p><p>Alan<b>:</b> Out. Walking.</p><p>Martin<b>:</b> Do you know what time it is?</p><p>Alan<b>:</b> No. And I don’t care, either.</p></i></blockquote><p>In a business letter, the salutation can be followed by a colon.</p><blockquote><p><i>To Whom It May Concern<b>:</b></i></p></blockquote>"
"Misuse Of Colon|  "	"<p>A colon should not separate a noun from its verb, a verb from its object or subject complement, a preposition from its object, nor a subject from its predicate. If you are unsure, it would be better to leave the colon out than misuse it.</p><blockquote><p><i><font color='red'>The four directions are<b>:</b> north, south, east and west.</font></i></p></blockquote><p>While this sentence does have a list, the colon is incorrectly used because it separates the verb are from its object <i>north, south, east</i> and <i>west</i>. The colon could be removed, or the sentence could be re-written to use the colon properly (with an independent clause on one side of the colon and the list on the other side).</p><blockquote><i><p>There are four directions<b>:</b> north, south, east and west.</p><p><font color='red'>When I graduate, I want to go to<b>:</b> Rome, Israel and Egypt.</font></p></i></blockquote><p>The colon should be removed from this sentence because it separates the preposition <i>to</i> from its objects <i>Rome, Israel</i> and <i>Egypt</i>.</p><blockquote><p><i>Michael like desserts such as<b>:</b> cake, cookies and doughnuts.</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Such as</i> doesn’t require a colon after it.</p>"
"Semicolon Use| "	"<p>In formal writing, semicolons are used to connect two independent clauses which are related somehow. They work like a soft period, separating the thoughts but keeping the flow of the first sentence.</p><blockquote><i><p>I’m looking for my book<b>;</b> where do you suppose I put it?<p>Money is the root of all evil<b>;</b> I don’t believe the reverse is necessarily true.</p><p>Martha has gone to the library<b>;</b> Andrew has gone to play soccer.</p><p>Journalism has changed over the last hundred years<b>;</b> possibly, this change is for the better.</p></i></blockquote><p>In creative writing, you can use a semicolon to connect multiple ideas which are expressed in independent clauses. The effect is very poetic: be sure you don’t use this in formal writing.</p><blockquote><p><i>The woman was heartbreakingly beautiful<b>;</b> she was dark and stormy; she was utterly dangerous.</i></p></blockquote><p>Semicolons can also be used to separate short clauses in a list after a colon has been used. This is done to clarify the ideas for the reader so they don’t get confused; this practice is particularly useful if the clauses have commas or other punctuation in them.</p><blockquote><i><p>Please do the following assignments for homework: read pages 15-17 and 20-33 in your math text<b>;</b> finish the outline for your <b>Canada: A Short History</b> essay; finish reading <b>The Giver</b>, but don’t start writing the essay yet.</p><p>I need the weather statistics for the following cities: London, England; London, Ontario; Paris, France; Paris, Ontario; Perth, Scotland; Perth, Ontario.</p></i></blockquote><p>A semicolon should only be followed by a capital letter if the word is a proper noun or an acronym.</p><blockquote><i><p>We can go to the museum to do some research<b>;</b> Mondays are pretty quiet there.</p><p>Let’s go to Europe<b>;</b> Paris is nice in the spring.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Semicolon With Conjunctions| "	"<p>Semicolons should not be used before a conjunction (<i>and, but, yet, so</i>) which connects two clauses. Use a comma instead.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'>Claudia is really into vocal music<b>;</b> but opera is one of her favourite types of music.</font></i></blockquote><p>Both <i>Claudia is really into vocal music</i> and <i>opera is one of her favourite types of music</i> are independent clauses joined by the conjunction but. The semicolon should be replaced by a comma.</i><blockquote><i><font color='red'>Mary went to the market<b>;</b> and she bought fresh peaches.</font></i></blockquote><p>The semicolon is incorrectly used in this sentence. It could be replaced by a comma, or the conjunction could be removed.</p><blockquote><i><p>Mary went to the market<b>;</b> she bought fresh peaches.</p><p><font color='red'>He has neither education<b>;</b> nor money.</font></p></i></blockquote><p>This semicolon is separating the two conjunctions neither…nor. We could remove either the semicolon or the conjunctions.</p><blockquote><i>He has no money<b>;</b> he has no education.</i></blockquote>"
"Semicolon With Conjunctive Adverbs|  "	"<p>If there is a conjunctive adverb linking two independent clauses, you should use a semicolon. Some conjunctive adverbs are: <i>moreover, nevertheless, however, otherwise, therefore, then, finally, likewise</i> and <i>consequently</i>. </p><blockquote><i><p>I needed to go for a walk and get some fresh air; also, I needed to buy milk.</p><p>Reports of the damage caused by the hurricane were greatly over-exaggerated<b>;</b> indeed, the storm was not a “hurricane” at all.</p><p>The students had been advised against walking alone at night<b>;</b> however, Cathy decided walking wasn’t dangerous if it was early in the evening.</p><p>I’m not all that fond of the colors of tiger-lilies<b>;</b> moreover, they don’t smell very good.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Semicolon Between Dependent And Independent Clauses| "	"<p>A semicolon should not be used between an independent clause and a dependent clause; use a comma instead.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'><p>Broadening your horizons can be beneficial to all aspects of your life<b>;</b> employment particularly benefits.</p><p>I cannot understand why our professor insists upon full bibliographies<b>;</b> because they’re not really necessary, are they?</p><p>Puffing and panting<b>;</b> we trudged up the last section of the hill.</p></font></i></blockquote>"
"Apostrophe Use: Possessive Case Of Nouns|  "	"<p>With the addition of ‘s (or sometimes just the apostrophe), a noun can change from a plain old person, place or thing to a person, place or thing that owns something.</p><p>If the noun doesn’t end with an s, add ‘s to the end of the noun.</p><blockquote><i><p>This is Mary and a dog. The dog is Mary<b>’</b>s; Mary is not the dog<b>’</b>s.</p><p>This thick blind is capable of shutting out the summer sun<b>’</b>s heat and light.</p><p>This is the way to the men<b>’</b>s room.</p><p>She got a job in the children<b>’</b>s section of the library.</p></i></blockquote><p>If the noun ends with an s, add just the apostrophe to the end of the noun.</p><blockquote><i><p>This is the boys<b>’</b> bedroom.</p><p>My parents<b>’</b> house is a lovely old one.</p><p>Where is Jess’ book bag?</p><p>The scissors<b>’</b> handles just snapped off.</p></i></blockquote><p>If you have a compound noun, change only the last one to the possessive.</p><blockquote><i><p>Mike and Amanda<b>’</b>s new loft apartment is really neat.</p><p>Please tell Annie and Mary<b>’</b>s mother that they<b>’</b>ll be late getting home from school.</p></i></blockquote><p>If the possessor is a building, an object, or a piece of furniture, then you don’t need to add an apostrophe to show possession.</p><blockquote><i><p><font color='red'>The maid cleaned the hotel<b>’</b>s room.</font></p><p><font color='red'>The hotel<b>’</b>s room – the hotel room</font></p><p>The office’s lobby – the office lobby</p><p><font color='red'>The shoe<b>’</b>s lace – the shoe lace</font></p><p>The car’s door – the car door</p><p><font color='red'>The table<b>’</b>s top – the table top</font></p><p>The chair’s leg – the chair leg</p></i></blockquote>"
"Apostrophe Use: Contractions And Omissions |  "	"<p>Apostrophes can show an omission of letters, whether as part of a contraction or when showing dialect or accent.</p><blockquote><i><p>I’m = I am</p><p>Where’s = where is</p><p>Who’s = who is</p><p>It’s = it is, or it has (<b>N.B.</b> This is the contraction, not the possessive.)</p><p>Isn’t = is not</p><p>Couldn’t = could not</p><p>Who’d = who would</p><p>Aren’t = are not</p><p>‘Cause = because</p><p>Ain’t = is not, are not</p><p>D’you = do you</p><p>Hallowe’en = Hallow evening</p><p>Jo’burg = Johannesburg</p><i></blockquote>"
"Apostrophe And Possessive Pronouns| "	"<p>Possessive pronouns don’t require an apostrophe.</p><blockquote><i><p>Who<b>’s</b> book is that? = Whose book is that?</p><p>That book is his<b>’</b>. = That book is his.</p><p>No, it’s mine<b>’s</b>! = No, it’s mine!</p><p>The cat washed it<b>’s</b> face. = The cat washed its face.</p></i></blockquote><p><b>N.B.</b> <i>It’s</i> is a contraction of <i>it is</i>, not a possessive pronoun.</p><b>Exception:</b><p>Indefinite pronouns can be made plural.</p><blockquote><i><p>One – one<b>’s</b></p><p>It is best to mind one<b>’s</b> own business.</p><p>One should always look one<b>’s</b> best.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Apostrophe Use: Forming Plurals Of Lowercase Or Uppercase Letters| "	"<p>When you’re trying to describe plural letters, use ‘s after the letter so that it’s clearly identified as a letter, not a word. If, for instance, you write <i>is</i> instead of <i>i’s</i>, your reader will get confused between the verb and the letter i.</p><blockquote><i><p>Mind your p<b>’s</b> and q<b>’s</b>, my dear!</p><p>Alliteration refers to the repetition of a sound, such as all the s<b>’s</b> in <b>Sammy the snake slithered silently</b>.</p><p>How am I supposed to write this essay if my keyboard won’t let me type any e<b>’s</b>?!</p></i></blockquote>"
"Apostrophe Use: Possessive Case Of Indefinite Pronouns| "	"<p>Indefinite pronouns can be made possessive with the use of ‘s. Indefinite pronouns are words like <i>someone, other,</i> and <i>any</i>.</p><blockquote><i><p>It’s always good to know one<b>’s</b> enemy.</p><p>Is this anyone<b>’s</b> backpack lying here on the ground?</p><p>That’s not Helen<b>’s</b> handwriting; it must be someone else’s.</p><p>Try putting yourself in another<b>’s</b> shoes.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Use Of Quotation Marks| "	"<p>Quotation marks are used to identify certain words as being the ones a person said. Quotation marks are used to separate the quote from the rest of the sentence or text which is not quoted. Double and single quotation marks are pretty much interchangeable; check the conventions for any specific format you might be using.</p><blockquote><i><p>He said, <b>“</b>I’m off to the store. Need anything?<b>”</b></p><p>Written on the wall was the quip, <b>“</b>Petrus hic erat.<b>”</b></p><p><b>“</b>A lazy oaf<b>”</b>: that’s what Mom said you were.</p><p>No matter what her professor said, Anna didn’t think she was <b>“</b>over-exuberant<b>”</b>.</p></i></blockquote><p>Quotation marks always come in pairs; we say the first set “opens” the quote, and the second set “closes” the quote. Make sure the quotes are opened and closed.</p><blockquote><i>They shouted,_The British are coming!<b>”</b></i></blockquote><p>This sentence is missing the opening quotation marks.</p><blockquote><i>They shouted, <b>“</b>The British are coming!<b>”</b></i></blockquote><p>As anything within the quotation marks is separate from the text you’ve written, the capitals and punctuation must be those of the quote, not those of your text. For instance, no matter where it is in your sentence, the beginning of a quoted sentence should be capitalized.</p><blockquote><i>The little boy said, <b>“</b>No matter what, I’m not cleaning my room!<b>”</b></i></blockquote><p>The capital N needs to be there because it belongs to the quote. The exclamation mark goes inside the quotation marks because it belongs to the quote.</p>"
"Double Quotation Marks | "	"<p>Double quotation marks are the ones with two apostrophes in each set: “___”. These are probably the most commonly used quotation marks, but they’re exactly the same as single quotation marks. Americans usually use double quotation marks.</p><blockquote><i><p>“Dinner’s ready!” she called.</p><p>The review said the play was “funny” and “inspiring”.</p></i></blockquote><p>If you use double quotation marks as a standard, make sure you use single quotes when you’re writing a quote inside a quote. Don’t use a set of double quotation marks inside another set.</p><blockquote><i><p>Andrew said, <b>“</b>The review said the play was “funny” and “inspiring”.<b>”</b></p><p>Andrew said, <b>“</b>The review said the play was <b>‘</b>funny<b>’</b> and <b>‘</b>inspiring<b>’</b>.<b>”</b></p></i></blockquote>"
"Single Quotation Marks| "	"<p>Single quotation marks are the ones with one apostrophe in each set: ‘___’. These are commonly used in British English, but they’re interchangeable with double quotation marks.</p><blockquote><i><p>‘Dinner’s ready!’ she called.</p<p>The review said the play was ‘funny’ and ‘inspiring’.</p></i></blockquote><p>If you use single quotation marks as a standard, make sure you use double quotes when you’re writing a quote inside a quote. Don’t use a set of single quotation marks inside another set.</p><blockquote><i><p>Andrew said, <b>‘</b>The review said the play was ‘funny’ and ‘inspiring’.<b>’</b></p><p>Andrew said, <b>‘</b>The review said the play was <b>“</b>funny<b>”</b> and <b>“</b>inspiring<b>”</b>.<b>’</b></p></i></blockqutoe>"
"Direct Quotations| "	"<p>A direct quotation is when you quote precisely what someone else said (or wrote). You’ll need quotation marks to show a direct quote.</p><blockquote><i><p>Jones claims that <b>“</b>the end of the world is not coming soon<b>”</b>.</p><p><b>“</b>I finished my sandwich,<b>”</b> said the small girl to her mother.</p></i></blockquote><p>If you’re quoting something which has a mistake in it – a spelling, grammar or punctuation error – use [<i>sic</i>] to show that the error is not yours.</p><blockquote><i><p><b>“</b>If theirs [sic] not enough food to go around, the government should consider foreign aid,<b>”</b> the man said.</p><p>In her journal, the writer said, <b>“</b>I wish my muse had a soothing balm, [sic] for the whip marks she made on my back.<b>”</b></p></i></blockquote><p>You can even use it to show that you’re using American English instead of British English (or vice versa).</p><blockquote><i>In the section on capitalization, the author suggested we <b>“</b>look to the Germans for the origins of capitalisation [sic]<b>”</b>.</p></blockquote>"
"Indirect Quotations|  "	"<p>Indirect quotes are when you use your own words to rephrase what someone else said. There’s no need for quotation marks in an indirect quote.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'>Marian said that, <b>“</b>There should be more work tables in this library.<b>”</b></font></i></blockquote><p>The word that shows us this quote is being paraphrased. It should read, <i>Marian said that there should be more work tables in this library</i>.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'>Where did Mark say he was going? He said <b>“</b>he was going to buy bread<b>”</b>.</font></i></blockquote><p>We can tell by the verbs that this is an indirect quote: the quotation marks can be removed from this sentence.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'>Andrew said the new restaurant was <b>“</b>good<b>”</b>.</font></i></blockquote><p>There’s nothing special about a restaurant being good, so there’s probably no need to draw attention to this indirect quote. If Andrew was being facetious or witty (e.g. <i>he said the restaurant was “colonically distressing”</i>), you might use quotation marks to turn this into a direct quote.</p>"
"Quotations Within A Quotation|  "	"<p>You can put a quote within a quote: no problem. (If you’re putting a quote within a quote within a quote, that’s probably a bit too much and you should start another sentence.) This is when you use the two different kinds of quotes: singles and doubles.</p><p>If you are using double quotation marks for the “outside quote”, then use single quotation marks for the “inside quote”; if you’re using single quotes on the outside, use doubles on the inside.</p><p>Some formats such as MLA and APA specify which quotes to use where, so be sure to check the conventions for a particular format.</p><blockquote><i><p><b>“</b>I see no need,<b>”</b> my mother drawled, <b>“</b>for <b>‘</b>contemplation<b>’</b>, as you put it. Get up off the couch and start doing your homework.<b>”</b></p><p>Annie said, <b>‘</b>I’ve gone through this whole essay, and I can’t find what your professor means by <b>“</b>that other issue<b>”’</b>.</p><p><b>“</b>Let us explore what is meant by the quote <b>‘</b>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,<b>’”</b> said the teacher.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Quotation Marks In Titles| "	"<p>The rules for using quotation marks around titles have changed recently: most titles are now italicized. However, before computer usage became widespread, handwriting and typewriters made the use of quotation marks around titles commonplace. If you’re using a computer for your writing, it’s easiest to italicize all titles. If you’re handwriting or using a computer, or if your format dictates the use of quotation marks, you can put quotes around the titles of shorter pieces of work: plays, poems, articles, chapters or subchapters of a book, songs, T.V. episodes, etc. The titles of longer books like novels or instruction manuals should be underlined.</p><blockquote><i><p>Read the article <b>“</b>I Am Writing Blindly<b>”</b> by Roger Rosenblatt.</p><p>My favourite song is <b>“</b>Free To Be You And Me<b>”</b>.</p><p>What did you think of <b>“</b>Romeo and Juliet<b>”</b>?</p><p><font color='red'><b>“</b>Encyclopedia Britannica<b>”</b> is a pretty dull read.</font></p></i></blockquote><p>In this last sentence, we’d underline the title of the encyclopedia because it’s the name of a longer work.</p>"
"Quotation Marks Setting Off Specific Words Or Terms | "	"<p>Quotation marks can occasionally be used for emphasis, but only when quoting a single word which someone else used. Usually, this implies that the author doesn’t agree with the use of the term.</p><blockquote><i><p>He said he was <b>“</b>working<b>”</b>; it looked to me like he was procrastinating.</p><p>You call this filthy room <b>“</b>clean<b>”</b>?!</p></i></blockquote><p>As with titles, the rules for using quotation marks for emphasis have changed since people started doing all the writing on computers. If a word needs to be emphasized but is not being quoted, you should put it in italics. If you’re writing by hand or using a typewriter, you can use quotation marks for emphasis, to separate a certain word from the rest of the sentence.</p><blockquote><i><p>“They’re”, “their”, and “there” are easily confused as they’re homophones.</p><p>“Cool” can refer to temperature, or it can mean something is good; “sweet” is also used as slang to mean “good”.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Quotations Marks With Other Punctuation | "	"<p>The rules about quotation marks and other punctuation differ from country to country, from format to format. If you’re at all unsure as to where to put the punctuation, consult a style guide.</p><p>That said, here are some fairly common guidelines in American English: the punctuation that comes with the quote stays within the quote, and the punctuation that comes with the unquoted sentence stays outside the quote.</p><p>If you end a sentence with a quote that contains end-of-sentence punctuation (period, exclamation mark or question mark), there’s no need for anymore punctuation at the end of the sentence: just let the quote’s punctuation do all the work.</p><blockquote><i><p>The man said, <b>“</b>I shall be re-born!<b>”</b></p><p>So I asked, <b>“</b>Where did you get that outfit? Your mother’s childhood dress-up box?<b>”</b></p></i></blockquote><p>Here, the exclamation mark serves as the punctuation for the whole sentence, including the quote.</p><p>If you’re only quoting part of a sentence, you’ll need to use your own punctuation at the end of your sentence, outside the quotation marks. Commas and semicolons usually go outside the quotation marks.</p><blockquote><i><p>The project manager suggested that everyone <b>“</b>hone their personal skills and talents<b>”</b> carefully.</p><p>Matthew is <b>“</b>contemplating higher things<b>”</b>; Mary blatantly confesses to napping.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Unnecessary Quotation Marks| "	"<p>If no one said the words, do not use quotation marks. Quotation marks shouldn’t be used for emphasis, indirect quotations, or anything other than quotes.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'><p><b>“</b>Do not<b>”</b> park here.</p><p><b>“</b>Never<b>”</b> use quotation marks for emphasis!</p></font></i></blockquote><p>Don’t use quotation marks for emphasis. For emphasis, you can use italics, underline, or bold letters.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'>They said that the <b>“</b>British were coming<b>”</b>.</font></i></blockquote><p>Because of <i>that, we</i> know this is an indirect quote, so the quotation marks aren’t necessary.</p><blockquote><i><font color='red'>The neighbour popped in to say <b>“</b>hi<b>”</b>.</font></i></blockquote>"
"What Is A Dash?| "	"<p>A dash is a little line that is written in the middle of the line (not at the bottom: that’s an underscore). It’s longer than a hyphen. Dashes are used to separate groups of words, not to separate parts of words like a hyphen does.</p><p>There are three formats for dashes: <i>em, en</i>, and the <i>double hyphen</i>. If you’re writing on a computer, the font you’ve chosen will automatically take care of the issue for you. If you’re writing by hand or on a typewriter, the em dash is longer (the width of the letter m) and is used between words; the en dash is a little shorter (the width of the letter n) and is used between numbers like <i>forty-four</i>; the double hyphen is used on typewriters or with computer fonts which don’t have a dash key.</p><blockquote><i>We waited for the bus — in the cold, driving rain — for almost an hour.</i></blockquote><p>This sentence uses em dashes.</p><blockquote><i>We waited for the bus -- in the cold, driving rain -- for almost an hour.</i></blockquote><p>This sentence uses the double hyphens, but we’d only use them if we were writing on a machine which didn’t have an em dash. Even when handwriting, an em dash is naturally used.</p><blockquote><i>Can you count out twenty-six dollars, please?</i></blockquote><p>This sentence uses an en dash.</i>"
"Dash: Parenthetical Information| "	"<p>Dashes are used to offset parenthetical information – that is, information which you might put in parentheses. When you use parentheses, though, the emphasis is taken off the parenthetical information and put on the rest of the sentence. When you use dashes (two of them), the emphasis is put on the information within the dashes.</p><p>For this usage, do make sure there are two dashes: one on each side of the parenthetical information.</p><blockquote><i><p>While I was shopping – wandering aimlessly up and down the aisles, actually – I ran into our old neighbour.</p><p>An etymological dictionary is one of the few books – no, it’s the <b>only</b> book – you’ll ever need.</p><p>There has recently been an increase – though opposed fiercely, violently by many people – in alternative education practices.</p><p>He was going to call off the project – or was he? – when the client increased the payment.</p><p>Travelling – that is, travelling by public transit – can be a relaxing activity if you bring music and reading material along with you.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Dash: Setting Off Appositives That Contain Commas|  "	"<p>An appositive is a small section of extra information which is inserted into a sentence for clarification. Commas are usually used to offset the appositive, but if the appositive contains one or more commas, that would get confusing for the reader. When using an appositive that contains a comma, offset it with dashes, instead.</p><blockquote><i><p>Four of us – Mike, Amanda, Katy and me – went to the conference last week.</p><p>Mr. M. glanced surreptitiously at his watch – his gold, diamond-encrusted watch – and suggested the meeting might adjourn for the day. </p><p>If you need something, call my assistant – Catherine, not Margaret – and she’ll help you.</p><p>Materialism – always wanting something more, something different – is good for the economy but bad for the soul.</p><p>The question words – who, what, when, where, why, and how – used to retrieve information in English.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Dash: Concluding A List Of Elements, Focusing Them All Toward One Point| "	"<p>When a sentence begins with an independent clause and ends with a list, you can use a colon between the clause and the list. When the list comes first, it’s better to use a dash to connect the list to the clause. This helps to take three potentially random things and focus them towards one idea which is easier for the reader to process.</p><blockquote><i><p>Dishes, laundry, dusting – they’re all done now, and I need a rest.</p><p>Crocodiles, alligators – they both look the same to me and they look equally dangerous!</p><p>Chocolate, strawberry, vanilla – all ice cream tastes good, especially on a hot summer’s day.</p><p>Do this, do that, go here, go there – there’s so much to do that I don’t actually get much accomplished during the day.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Dash: Marking Sharp Turns In Thought, Restatements, Amplifications| "	"<p>Dashes can act like little warnings (like yellow road signs) that whatever the writer has been doing is about to change. Dashes identify a sudden break in the sentence as the writer changes tack, perhaps going entirely in another direction, or perhaps just pausing to insert another thought. This effect is usually fairly informal, and isn’t recommended for academic writing (as it might look like you don’t know what you’re talking about).</p><blockquote><i>Mary, could you – no, Mikey, don’t touch the sharp knife! – Mary, could you please set the table?</i></blockquote><p>A “sharp turn in thought” could be the switch when suddenly talking to a new person.</p><blockquote><i>Dinner is at 6:30 – not 6:29 or 6:31.</i></blockquote><p>This dash is for emphasis on the “amplification”: making sure the time is clarified.</p><blockquote><i><p>Where the heck is my – wait, what was I looking for?</p><p>Would you please – oh, never mind….</p></i></blockquote>"
"What Is A Hyphen?| "	"<p>Hyphens are the small lines (about half the size of a dash) which are written in the middle of the line. Hyphens connect words or parts of words to make a new word.</p><blockquote><i><p>Newfoundland is so-called because the land was new-found.</p><p>Rana is the proverbial out-of-work writer.</p></i></blockquote><p>They can also clarify which qualifier is modifying which word.</p><blockquote><i><p>This is my ancient philosophy professor.</p><p>This is my ancient-philosophy professor.</p></i></blockquote><p>Which is ancient: the philosophy or the professor?</p><p>Hyphens can attach a prefix or a suffix.</p><blockquote><i><p>I plan to spend the post-exam period sleeping and playing computer games.</p><p>The group’s philosophy causes the individual to re-examine all aspects of their life.</p><p>Though they are buoyed by the thrill of inheriting the throne, the heir-apparent has a burdened life.</p></i></blockquote><p>If, when using a prefix, you end up with identical letters beside each other, a hyphen will clarify the syllables so the reader knows how to pronounce the word.</p><blockquote><i><p>We need someone to co-ordinate everyone’s schedules.</p><p>Do you have any anti-icing spray for the door lock?</p><p>Annie took some time to wind down and re-energize.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen Connecting Two Or More Words Functioning Together As An Adjective Before A Noun| "	"<p>A hyphen can connect two (or possibly three… or four if you want to get really creative) words and turn them into a single adjective to modify a noun. The words can be nouns, adjectives, verbs or adverbs. Sometimes the same words used separately, and the meaning is entirely different than if the words are hyphenated. For instance, take a look at these two sentences, one of which uses a compound modifier:</p><blockquote><i><p>The table was covered by twenty odd books.</p><p>The table was covered by twenty-odd books.</p></i></blockquote><p>In the first sentence, the books are being described as <i>odd</i>; in the second sentence, there are <i>approximately twenty books</i> covering the table. The second sentence uses a compound modifier.</p><blockquote><i><p>Want some chocolate-chocolate-chip ice cream?</p><p>Watch out! That’s a one-way street!</p><p>Finally, they announced the long-awaited decision about the merger.</p><p>I prefer the light-blue shirt on you.</p><p>Despite severe autism, my brother is quite high-functioning.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen With Compound Modifiers| "	"<p>A compound modifier is two words connected by a hyphen, which acts like one adjective. Usually, these words can be used as individual modifiers, so the hyphen is required to clarify the meaning; for instance, American can be a noun or an adjective. When there are several of these words together, hyphens can make it clear as to which word is playing which role.</p><blockquote><i>It’s recommended you not take down any load bearing walls when renovating.</i></blockquote><p>In this sentence, it sounds like you shouldn’t take down any load which is holding up a wall. A hyphen should be inserted between load and <i>bearing</i>, so we understand not to take down any walls which are holding up a load.</p><blockquote><i><p>It’s recommended you not take down any load-bearing walls when renovating.</p><p>He’s training to become a hair-stylist.</p><p>What color of eye-shadow goes with this outfit?</p><p>This rock-hard cake is absolutely impossible to eat.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen With Noun, Adjective Or Adverb And Present Participle| "	"<p>When using a noun, adjective or adverb and a present participle (a word ending in ‑ing), we often have to put a hyphen between the two words to make it clear as to which word is modifying which.</p><blockquote><i>There are some beautiful looking flowers in the garden.</i></blockquote><p>Without the hyphen between <i>beautiful</i> and <i>looking</i>, we’re not sure if looking is modifying <i>beautiful</i> or <i>flowers</i> (perhaps it’s a new type of flower?).</p><blockquote><i><p>There are some beautiful-looking flowers in the garden.</p><p>Fast-acting medication can be useful when one has a headache.</p></i></blockquote><p><b>N.B.</b> This rule only applies if the adjectives come before the noun. If the adjectives come after the noun, you don’t need to hyphenate them.</p><blockquote><i>The medication is fast acting.</i></blockquote><p>There is some disagreement as to whether or not an adverb needs to be hyphenated, especially if the adverb ends in ‑ly. In British English, the hyphen is consistently used, but it’s usually left out in American English (unless it’s needed for clarity).</p><blockquote><i>The room was like a heavily decorated chocolate box.</i></blockquote><p>Because the adverb <i>heavily</i> is clearly modifying the verb <i>decorated</i>, no hyphen is required in this sentence.</p>"
"Hyphen With Compound Expressions| "	"<p>A compound expression is two words which are put together to make a new adjective, and is in common use. These two words should be hyphenated to clarify the intent of the new meaning, but the intention would still be understood if the hyphen were removed as the expressions are so familiar. Some examples of compound expressions are <i>time-sensitive</i>, <i>long-lasting</i>, and <i>life-long</i>.</p><blockquote><i><p>The small child was sitting on the sofa with his filthy, ratty, ever-present blanket.</p><p>One must be self-motivated in order to be a good student.</p><p>It’s a really bad idea to drive the wrong way on a one-way street.</p><p>This teddy bear has obviously been much-loved, as it’s falling apart at the seams.</p><p>Despite being less than 20 years old, this author is on his way to becoming well-known.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen In Compound Expression With Noun And Past Participle| "	"<p>When a noun is put together with a past participle (a verb ending in <i>‑ed</i>), this results in a compound adjective. Compound adjectives should always be hyphenated so the reader can distinguish them from the original, separate words. For instance, when we connect the noun <i>community</i> with the verb based, it makes the compound adjective <i>community-based</i>.</p><blockquote><i>The municipal government is funding a community-based education system.</i></blockquote><p>If there were no hyphen in this sentence, the reader might assume there was a word missing (maybe the author meant <i>a community based on an education system?</i>) The hyphen is required so that the past participle is changed from a verb to an adjective</p><blockquote><i><p>Wind-powered generators can be excellent sources of electricity.</p><p>Many veterinarians find meat-fed cats to be quite healthy.</p><p>Annie and Margaret are very close; they’re like long-lost sisters.</p><p>Knitting is my new-found activity of choice.</p><p>The history of America is fairly well-known around the world.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen In Compound Adjective With Numbers| "	"<p>When numbers are used as the first part of a compound adjective, they should have a hyphen connecting them to the noun which follows them. This way, the reader knows that both adjectives are being used to modify the noun.</p><p>This applies whether the number is written in words or in digits.</p><blockquote><i><p>The president of the company gave a 10-minute speech to the Board of Directors.</p><p>He is knowledgeable in thirteenth-century politics.</p><p>The boy threw a rock at the second-story window.</p></i></blockquote><p><b>N.B.</b> A hyphen is not required if the number is the second word in the compound adjective.</p><blockquote><i><p>He is a victim of Type 2 diabetes.</p><p>This elevator doesn’t go down to Basement 3.</p></i></blockquote><p>A hyphen is not required in this compound modifier because the number is the second element in the compound adjective</p><p>As well, you won’t need to hyphenate if the number is the only adjective.</p><blockquote><i>We live on the second story of an old house.</i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen In Compound Adjective With High Or Low| "	"<p>When using high or low as part of a compound adjective, a hyphen should be inserted between <i>high – or low –</i> and the word which it modifying. Some examples of compound adjectives using <i>high</i> and <i>low</i> are: <i>high-level/low-level</i> and <i>high-impact/low-impact</i>.</p><p>This also applies to comparatives and superlatives.</p><p>Remember that the use of hyphens should be limited. If you’re making a lot of comparisons, it may be in your best interest to re-phrase some sentences so you use the fewest hyphens possible.</p><blockquote><i><p>Low-flying airplanes contribute to the noise pollution in the area.</p><p>This car runs best on high-octane gasoline.</p><p>Low-income families often face more stress than their higher-income counterparts.</p><p>A high-interest savings account is one of the best ways to save money.</p><p>While a high-stress job like firefighting can be detrimental to one’s health, sometimes the pay-off is worth it.</p><p>It is generally preferable to have a position as a higher-level executive than as a menial worker.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen In Compound Adjective With Comparatives Or Superlatives| "	"<p>Some comparatives and superlatives are accomplished by using a suffix (e.g. <i>high<b>est</b></i>, <i>small<b>er</b></i>); if these words are used in a compound adjective, they should be hyphenated. Some comparatives and superlatives use more or most; these generally do not require a hyphen, although some older common phrases may use one.</p><blockquote><i><p>After five years as a paramedic, Matthew decided to look for a lower-stress job.</p><p>Following a personal dispute with his superiors, Andy was demoted to the lowest-level entry position in the company.</p><p>Hoping to improve business, Betty moved her tea shop to a faster-growing area of town.</p></i></blockquote><p>When using these comparisons, be careful that you haven’t used unnecessary words which may clutter your sentence.</p><blockquote><i>For Anna’s premature baby, we’ll need to get the smallest-sized clothes available.</i></blockquote><p>The word <i>sized</i> is redundant in this sentence, so it would be better to take it out and just use smallest clothes.</p><blockquote><i>Best-laid plans often fall apart.</i></blockquote><p>As it is an older common phrase, <i>best-laid</i> may or may not use a hyphen. Consider your audience, and use your own judgment.</p><blockquote><i>Best laid plans often fall apart.</i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen In Compound Adjective With Fractions| "	"<p>When using a fraction (e.g. <i>half</i> or <i>quarter</i>) as part of a compound adjective, it should be hyphenated so the reader understands which fraction is modifying which noun.</p><blockquote><i><p>I half-wanted to commit a felony.</p><p>A quarter-million dollars is still a large amount of money.</p><p>You’ll need one-third of a pound of flour and one egg.</p><p>Two-quarters are equal to one half, but one-half <b>sounds</b> smaller.</p><p>Three-quarters of his working hours are spent teaching mathematics; one-quarter is spent writing textbooks for elementary schools.</p><p>That’s a half-baked idea if I ever heard one!</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen In Compound Numbers| "	"<p>When writing a compound number – any number made up of two words – we use a hyphen in between them. This applies to any number between 21 and 99. Numbers higher than ninety-nine don’t require a hyphen.</p><blockquote><i><p>Forty-four</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>Fifty-six bottles of pop on the wall, fifty-six bottles of pop….</p><p>No, I won’t party “like it’s nineteen ninety-nine”.</p></i></blockquote><p>This rule applies even if these numbers are preceded by other numbers.</p><blockquote><i><p>One hundred and thirty-three</p><p>Six thousand and seventy-two.</p><p>One hundred million, forty-four thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five</p></i></blockquote><p>The rule also applies if a number between 21 and 99 is being used as an adjective.</p><blockquote><i><p>Ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.</p><p>Seventy-five billion dollars is not a lot of money when you’re researching space.</p><p>If twenty-two million people died, it would be called “a disaster”; if twenty-two million trees die, we call it “the pulp-and-paper industry”.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen With Prefixes <b>Ex</b>- (Meaning <b>Former</b>), <b>Self-, All-</b>| "	"<p>When the prefix ex- is used to mean former, it should be connected to the following noun with a hyphen.</p><blockquote><i><p>Don’t sit Adam next to Martha! She’s his ex-wife!</p><p>Though he no longer held an official position, the ex-mayor still attended all the town’s functions.</p><p>Michael is an ex-basketball player who is now working with disadvantaged youth.</p></i></blockquote><p>When the prefix <i>ex-</i> is used to mean <i>out of</i>, it doesn’t require a hyphen.</p><blockquote><i>The pope excommunicated the Church of England in the early 1500’s.</i></blockquote><p>When using Latin terminology, a hyphen isn’t necessary. In cases such as this, <i>ex also</i> means <i>out of</i>.</p><blockquote><i>You can tell it’s Prof. MacKendrick’s book because it has the <b>ex libris</b> bookplate inside the front cover.</i></blockquote><p>When using the reflexive prefix self-, it should be connected to the following word with a hyphen.</p><blockquote><i><p>Lying on the floor beside the plant he had knocked over and chewed on, the cat looked extremely self-satisfied.</p><p>Do you want a self-serve or a full-serve gas station?</p></i></blockquote><p>Make sure you don’t confuse the prefix <i>self-</i> with the noun <i>self</i>.</p><blockquote><i>The self serves no other.</i></blockquote><p>No hyphen is used in this sentence because <i>self</i> is used as a noun.</p><p>When using <i>all</i> as a prefix, it should be connected to the following word with a hyphen.</p><blockquote><i><p>English is the all-encompassing subject: none of the other subjects could be taught without it.</p><p>It’s a bad leader who thinks of himself as all-powerful.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen With Suffix <b>-Elect</b>| "	"<p>Elect can be a verb or a suffix. When used as a suffix, it should always be connected to the previous noun by a hyphen. You can use <i>‑elect</i> for any person or position which has been elected.</p><blockquote><i><p>Democracy demands that the president-elect work on behalf of the majority of the citizens.</p><p>We need this signed by the new mayor-elect by midnight.</p><p>As chairman-elect, his first act was to ban junk food from all the meeting rooms.</p><p>The term <b>dictator-elect</b> is an oxymoron.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Hyphen Between A Prefix And A Capitalized Word | "	"<p>If you’re adding a prefix to a proper noun, keep the capital on the proper noun. There’s no need to capitalize the prefix unless it’s at the beginning of the sentence.</p><blockquote><i><p>Mark is reading a book on pre-Civil War Argentina.</p><p>The post-WWII housing boom is still evident today in most towns and cities.</p><p>One does not need to be anti-American to be pro-Canadian.</p><p>Anti-Semitism is a major motif in Shakespeare’s <b>The Merchant of Venice</b>.</p></i></blockquote><p>The prefix <i>anti-</i> is capitalized because it’s at the beginning of the sentence.</p>"
"Period| "	"<p>A period is a full stop.  It marks the end of a sentence.  It marks the end of an idea or a thought.  It marks the end of an action.  After a period, something entirely new begins. It’s final: nothing is up for debate.</p><p>In formal writing, the period is going to be the most common end-of-sentence punctuation mark as questions are (theoretically) being answered, not asked, and exclamation marks are discouraged because of the tone they imply. Periods have a certain finality, but it’s less forceful than an exclamation mark. Periods can be used at the end of imperative (telling someone to do something) or declarative (explaining something) sentences.</p><blockquote><i><p>I’m not asking again<b>.</b> Do the dishes, please<b>.</b></p><p>If it rains, remember to bring an umbrella<b>.</b></p><p>On Sunday, we went for a walk in the park: it was really nice out<b>.</b></p><p>Martha lay in the hammock, thinking about what she would write in her history essay<b>.</b></p><p>When the doorbell rang, Matthew just ignored it<b>.</b></p></i></blockquote>"
"Question Mark| "	"<p>A question mark is, naturally, a mark which shows the sentence is a question.  A question mark is required at the end of an interrogative sentence. Usually, interrogative sentences are identified by a question word (<i>who, what, when, where, why, how</i>), but sometimes we leave the question words out and just use tone to imply the question. </p><p>An interrogative sentence must be identified by a question mark, so the reader understands the writer’s intended meaning.</p><blockquote><i><p>When do you need to have this finished<b>?</b></p><p>Can you have this finished by tonight<b>?</b></p><p>I need to have this finished by tonight<b>?</b></p><p>Will you eat dinner with me<b>?</b></p><p>How are we going to get all this stuff done<b>?</b></p></i></blockquote><p>Do not use a question mark at the end of an indirect question. A period should be used instead.</p><blockquote><i><p>She wondered if it was going to rain soon<b>.</b></p><p>Maggie asked about when they’d be coming to visit<b>.</b></p></i></blockquote>"
"Exclamation Mark| "	"<p>Exclamation marks are used in exclamatory sentences, and sometimes in imperative sentences.</p><p>Avoid using exclamation marks in formal writing. Formal writing is considered a means of communicating information, and is kept rather boring so that communication is not interrupted in any way. Exclamation marks impart an excitement which may distract the reader from the information. Generally, exclamation marks are not used in formal writing as they are seen to concentrate on the emotion rather than the information. Use of an exclamation mark might also imply a lack of professionalism on the writer’s part.</p><p>If you’re writing informally or creatively, an exclamation mark can be even more effective than words when implying tone.</p><blockquote><i><p>Global warming will be the downfall of mankind!</p><p>The author believes her editor to be <b>entirely</b> in the wrong!</p><p>Careful! It’s hot!</p><p>I said, clean your room!</p><p>Yay! Exams are finished, and I’m free!</p></i></blockquote>"
"Brackets| "	"<p>The term <i>brackets</i> is rather vague; there are several varieties of brackets.</p><p>In Britain, <i>brackets</i> can refer to parentheses (the American term), or round brackets. These are the most commonly seen.</p><p><b>[ ]</b> Square brackets are use much like parentheses. When you’re quoting someone and you need to put in some sort of explanation (e.g. clarify a pronoun or use <i>sic</i> to show an error), you put it in square brackets.</p><blockquote><i>According to all the music magazines, “it’s the new up-and-coming band”.</i></blockquote><p>The problem with this sentence is that we don’t know who <i>it</i> is. This is where we’d use square brackets to put in the actual name of the band.</p><blockquote><i><p>According to all the music magazines, “<u>[Flashhart]</u> is the new up-and-coming band”.</p><p>The leader of the band is quoted as saying, “We be <u>[sic]</u> all that.”</p></i></blockquote><p>We use <i>sic</i> in square brackets to show that the grammatical error is quoted, that it’s not our error.</p><p><b>{ }</b> Curly brackets are used in music and mathematics, not in English text.</p><p><b>< ></b> Chevron brackets are also mainly used in mathematics, but they are also used in some dictionaries to demonstrate how something is written.</p><blockquote><i>The word is written and pronounced /dawg/.</i></blockquote><p>Some languages (e.g. French) use double chevron brackets << >> to show quotes. If you’re putting a French quote in the middle of an English text, change the chevron brackets to quotation marks.</p><blockquote><i><p><></p><p>The mother said to her child, “Je t’aime.”</p></i></blockquote>"
"Ellipsis| "	"<p>The term ellipsis comes from the Greek word meaning omission: an <i>ellipsis</i> shows that something has been left out. If you’re quoting someone but only want part of that quote, use an ellipsis to show that you’ve taken some words out (your reader trusts that you’ve kept the original meaning of the words, even though you’ve taken them out of their original context).</p><blockquote><i><p>“The battle, due to foul weather and lack of leadership, was lost” →“The battle<u>…</u> was lost.”</p><p>“I wore my new silver, strapless, floor-length, silk dress and matching shoes.” → “I wore my new<u>…</u> dress and matching shoes.” </p><p>“Follow these twenty-five simple steps <u>…</u> and you’ll be able to cook the perfect turkey.”</p><p>As the song says, “Happy birthday to you<u>…</u>”</p></i></blockquote><p>An ellipsis can also be used to show that someone has stopped speaking or thinking before the sentence has been completed, or that there’s a long pause in the speech. This is an informal usage: don’t use it in academic writing.</p><blockquote><i><p>Andrew, can you, um<u>…</u> never mind, I forgot what I was saying.</p><p>So, do you think we should<u>…</u>?</p><p>He<u>…</u> speaks<u>…</u> so<u>…</u> slowly<u>…</u> it’s<u>…</u> as<u>…</u> if<u>…</u> he<u>…</u> is<u>…</u> trying<u>…</u> to<u>…</u> annoy<u>…</u> you.</p></i></blockquote>"
"Slash| "	"<p>There are two kinds of slashes.</p><p>** This is a backslash. It’s not used in written English; it’s only used in computing. Unless you’re writing about computers or including an url in your bibliography, don’t use a backslash.</p><p>/ This is a slash, sometimes called a forward slash to distinguish it from the backslash. It doesn’t have a large role in formal English, but it’s used in specific cases.</p><p>A slash can show a line break in poem, song, or play, usually if several short lines are being written together on one long line. Remember to put a space after the slash.</p><blockquote><i><p>Mary had a little lamb<u>/</u> little lamb, little lamb<u>/</u> Mary had a little lamb<u>/</u> whose fleece was white as snow.</p><p>The quality of mercy is not strained/ it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven/ upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:/ It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</p></i></blockquote><p>Slashes can also be used in some short forms, although these shouldn’t be used in formal writing. In this case, there shouldn’t be a space after the slash.</p><blockquote><i><p><u>w/o</u> = without</p><p><u>w/</u> = with</p><p><u>c/o</u> = care of (used when posting a letter or parcel)</p><p><u>a/c</u> = air conditioning</p></i></blockquote><p>Sometimes we used a slash between two small words, if it’s an informal case where the reader can choose between the two words. When using a slash like this, we don’t put a space after it.</p><blockquote><i><p>I’m starving! I can’t wait for a snack <u>and/or</u> dinner!</p><p><u>If/when</u> Mary ever shows up, we can all head out to the party together.</p><p>Burgers or pizza for dinner? Yeah, <u>either/or</u> is fine with me.</p></i></blockquote><p>Dictionaries will often use a slash on either side of a word when showing the pronunciation. Generally, the word between the slashes will be written phonetically. This usage doesn’t require a space after the first slash, but it does require one after the second slash.</p><blockquote><i><p>The pronunciation of is <u>/kaet/</u>.</p><p>Shoe: <u>/shoo/</u> an article of protective clothing worn over the foot; generally made of leather or cloth with a hard sole.</p></i></blockquote>"
