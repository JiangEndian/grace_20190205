"Hi, Dori Madson here, host of the KORG-FM afternoon show. My dog, Spot, loves to run. The trouble is, she was always running out of our yard into the neighbors' yards. Once, she even ran into the street and nearly got hit by a car! That's when I called my friends at InvisiFence. They came right over,<font color=""#038041""> explained their program, and within a couple of hours had erected an invisible barrier around our yard that keeps Spot on our property just like a real fence would. Spot can now run happily around our yard, and me and my family don't have to worry about her running away. She'll go right to the edge of the yard, but won't go past it. The Invisifence process was smooth, quick, and surprisingly affordable -- much cheaper than putting a real fence around my yard would have been.</font> If you're looking for an effective way to keep your dog on your property, call Invisifence now. They're right here in town, at 789-9876. Or, check them out on the web at invisifence.com. Take it from me, you'll be glad you did."

"Good evening everyone. Welcome to the Richmond Real Estate training course. My name's Wendy Pozinka,<font color=""#038041""> and I'm a licensed real estate agent and personnel director for Richmond. At the end of our six-week course all of you, hopefully, will be able to pass the real estate exam and become Richmond agents. Here are some things to note before we begin our training.</font> First, you need to hand in your blue class registration forms at the table in the front of the room. Then, go the table against the right wall to find your name tag and a packet of course information. Next, go the table in the back corner to pick up your text book. Once you have done all these things, find a seat and sit down. When everyone's ready Nathan Richmond, our company president, will say a few remarks.<font color=""#038041""> After that, we'll head for the conference room and tonight's first class. </font>Okay? Are there any questions?"

Based on what's happened in the past, it's a bit difficult to talk about the future, because, if you had asked me this question five years ago, there's no way I would have predicted that our company could grow this much, and would have become the leading domestic brand in our industry. It still seems surreal.</font> So, I'm hesitant to look too far forward. There are two things that I hope will happen, and that we will certainly strive like heck for. <font color=""#038041"">One is to make sure we don't rest on our laurels, but look for ways to constantly improve our product. The other is to compete more on the worldwide market, so that in a short while our name is as well known in Iceland as it is in Iowa.</font> Those, I guess, would be our two main short-term goals. Honestly, I don't think much beyond that.

"<font color=""#038041"">It's my pleasure to introduce our new woman's basketball coach, MaryAnn Robinson. </font>We interviewed six candidates, and chose MaryAnn because of her experience and enthusiasm. She knows basketball well, not only because she was a college player herself, at Western University, but she also comes from a basketball family. Her father, Jerry, was a long-time high school coach, and her mother, Brenda, has coached youth basketball for more than 20 years. Her two sisters, Linda and Abigail, also played hoops in high school and college. After a brief pro career, MaryAnn returned to Western as an assistant coach for two years, and then moved up as an assistant at Tech University for four years. She got her first head coaching job at Valley State, which she led to the league championship before moving to Hickstown U, where she's gone 64-18 and won two league titles the past three seasons. <font color=""#038041"">So, without further ado, I'll turn the microphone over to MaryAnn to answer your questions.</font>"

"I'm Michelle Tomkins, and I have a special message from the state patrol. During the holidays, it's OK to celebrate with a little bit of good cheer. But it's not OK to get behind the wheel of a car after you've been drinking. With winter weather already making driving tough, don't make it any harder on yourself - or others - by trying to drive while you're intoxicated. <font color=""#038041"">If you plan to drink, arrange a designated driver before the party begins. If you notice someone who shouldn't be driving, talk them into giving you their keys. If they refuse, call 911. Remember, friends don't let friends drive drunk. Finally, if you do happen to find yourself too drunk to drive, call 555-TAXI for a special, free holiday lift. That's 555-TAXI for a free ride anywhere in the county. </font>The state patrol wishes everyone a happy, and safe, holiday season.

Accounting had a couple of questions about your expense vouchers.</font> They're missing a few receipts from your trip to Boston, and they need an additional copy of your airline ticket stub from your trip to Phoenix last month.<font color=""#038041""> When you get back from lunch, could you please call Steve Probinski in accounting. His extension is 991. Thanks. Also, I'm going to need the Boston report by 5 p.m. tomorrow. If you have any questions or problems with it, let me know.</font> I'm going out to lunch now, then I'll be tied up in a board meeting 'til about 4, but I have some time after that if you need to get together. OK, Tom, talk with your later."
"<font color=""#038041"">Looking at our county-wide traffic map, we see that traffic is crawling along the valley freeway right now,</font> as well as the southbound lanes of Interstate 6. Elsewhere it looks pretty good, with volumes on northbound Interstate 6 beginning to build up here, near Headport, and again here south of the city near Duwamps. A check of the KAPE real-time camera shows a smooth commute at this hour through downtown Floss. Now, switching to the eastside camera, we can see a stalled vehicle backing up traffic on State Route 7. But I see flashing lights, so help is on the scene. <font color=""#038041"">That's traffic at this hour, still pretty light but starting to build. I'm Ross Dinsmore for KAPE news.</font>

If you'd like to call Gil before you talk to me, his number is 555-876-0987. <font color=""#038041"">Again, my name is Andy, and you can reach me on my cell at 519-623-8651, or you could call me at my hotel: 519-805-2123, room 207.</font> Thanks, Liam. I hope to hear from you soon. Bye."

"<font color=""#038041"">Thank you! This is unbelievable; I'm floored. An individual award always reflects a team effort, and there are so many people who made this moment possible that I don't know where to start, really.

Oh, and I can't forget Sheena Ross, our scriptwriter, who wrote such a fantastic story. Finally, I guess, I'd like to thank my family, who have supported my dream every step of the way.<font color=""#038041""> I'm honored to accept this award, not only for myself, but on behalf of everyone in my life who has made my dream come true!</font>

I've been interested in science my whole life, so I was ecstatic to receive a scholarship here at Northwestern University to study biology. After earning my bachelor's degree, I got a master's at Stanford. I stayed on there as a researcher for about six years before moving back to Illinois and joining Bio-Tech. I was with Bio-Tech for 10 years before leaving last year to start my own research company, GreenEarth. We employ six full-time researchers, and in the past year we've made a couple of exciting new discoveries, which I'm going to tell you about in just a minute.</font> First, though, I just want to thank the Northwestern president, John Roche, and the faculty of the biology department for inviting me back to speak to you today.

"Have you ever have found a job, a home, or a lover through people you know? If you have, then you've networked successfully. Networking is not a new idea, but most people don't use it very effectively. <font color=""#038041"">Today I'm going to teach you a system called Super Networking that allows you to easily build a network of people around you, so that you have everyone and everything you need close at hand. </font>You can accomplish this with a simple strategy: Raise your visibility through increased interactions. The Super Networking System provides this effectively. First, we?ll discuss three basic concepts. The first concept is called the rule of 250. The average person knows about 250 people -- family members, friends, work colleagues, neighbors, club members, all the people you've done business with, and so on. But the average person doesn't work hard at meeting new people. Super Networkers do. While the average person knows 250 people,<font color=""#038041""> Super Networkers know an average of thirty-five hundred people. That's fourteen times more than the average person. So, you're going to focus on Super Networkers, based on the rule of 250. That's the first concept. Now,?</font>

Networking is not a new idea, but most people don't use it very effectively. <font color=""#038041"">Today I'm going to teach you a system called Super Networking that allows you to easily build a network of people around you, so that you have everyone and everything you need close at hand. </font>You can accomplish this with a simple strategy: Raise your visibility through increased interactions. The Super Networking System provides this effectively. First, we?ll discuss three basic concepts. The first concept is called the rule of 250.

While the average person knows 250 people,<font color=""#038041""> Super Networkers know an average of thirty-five hundred people. That's fourteen times more than the average person.

"<font color=""#038041"">This is Casey Carpenter with a KPUT news update. As you can see in this video footage, firefighters finally have the forest fire at Mount Capistan under control, and are in the process of extinguishing the final small blazes.</font> Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the fire, which caused an estimated $500 million in damage to homes in the Mount Capistan area.

"<font color=""#038041"">All right, now let's discuss our advertising revenue. As you know, this is a huge part of our business.</font> Ads account for about 60 percent of all our annual revenue. Last year, our advertising revenue grew by 3 percent. This year, our goal is to double that figure, to 6 percent. How can we do that? We've discussed running an auction for on-line advertisements.</font> The highest bidder will get to put their ad at the top of our web page. The winner of the auction will be the company that is willing to pay the most money per click. That means that each time someone clicks on their ad, they pay us. But they have to tell us, in advance, how much they are willing to pay. I think this is a good idea, but we have identified some software problems that have to be worked out so that we can set up an auction system. Let's put Jamie and Chris to work on those problems. We'll talk about this again in two weeks."

"Good evening, <font color=""#038041"">and thanks for joining us at the summer outdoor drama festival. We have an outstanding lineup this season, which kicks off tonight with a 21st century adaptation of Shakespeare's classic, ""Romeo and Juliet.""</font> At this time I would like to turn the microphone over to the author of this production, Martin Bourgette.<font color=""#038041""> Mr. Bourgette is renowned for putting fresh spins on classic tales, as he did at last year's festival with an updated version of ""Taming of the Shrew."" Martin started his drama career right here in Muston, earning his first starring role in our outdoor festival at age 14. He appeared in several other festival plays before majoring in drama at Muston University.</font> For the past 10 years, he has tried his hand at writing and directing, earning nationwide acclaim -- and a fair share of criticism -- for his unique perspectives and modern renderings of many classic plays. ""Romeo and Juliet"" is Mr. Bourgette's 21st stage production, and his fourth for our festival. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Martin Bourgette."

"Well,<font color=""#038041""> the short answer is yes, I do believe that the stock market is still a good place to invest your money. You pointed out that stock investors have lost a lot of money the past two years, and that's certainly true.</font> The market has tumbled down. But you have to take an historic perspective. Over the past 100 years, the stock market has averaged a 9-percent return. That's pretty good, much better than the 2 or 3 percent most bank accounts pay. <font color=""#038041"">So this is a down period for the market, but it will bounce back, and it's still a good avenue for the average investor. </font>In fact, now is actually a great time to buy stocks, while the market is depressed. However, I do not recommend that clients put all their money in the stock market. I advise people to invest in many different things. For example, they should have bonds, real estate, and maybe gold or silver as part of their investment portfolio. That way, they have some assurance that when stocks fall, their other holdings will rise to balance their total investment package. There's a lot of truth in the old saying, ""Don't put all you eggs in one basket."" Bearing that in mind, each investor is different, though. The types of investments I advise for each person depends on many factors, including their age, their income, and the degree of risk they are willing to take.<font color=""#038041""> Stocks provide a good return, for instance, but they are riskier than say, bonds.</font>"

"I have some big news for you.<font color=""#038041""> We have just bought Smith Company, our biggest rivals! The deal will be announced publicly tomorrow.</font> We will spend the next six months working out logistics -- how to best absorb their employees and buildings and assimilate them into our corporate culture. Once this transition process is completed, we will be the largest company in our industry. Though there will be several changes, none of you will lose your positions. And please inform your employees that all of them will be retained. We don't know yet how many workers from the Smith Company that we will keep, or exactly what positions they will have with us. The biggest advantage for us is that we get Smith's nearly two million customers, to complement the three-and-a-half million we have now. Our focus will be on retaining the Smith customers during the transition. We want you to think about how to do this, and we will meet again next week to brainstorm specific ideas.<font color=""#038041""> You can announce the news to your staff this afternoon, but please caution them not to say anything until the public announcement is made tomorrow morning.</font>"

"I'm Sandra Simpson with a KPLZ traffic update.<font color=""#038041""> A five-car collision at the intersection of Highway 10 and State Route 20 is backing up traffic on both those roadways.</font> Emergency vehicles are en route to the scene, and it looks like it will be quite awhile until that intersection is cleared. Meanwhile, a stalled vehicle in the right lane is causing hesitation on northbound Interstate Freeway 2 between the Main and First street exits.<font color=""#038041""> Southbound Interstate 2, on the other hand, is clear sailing right now, with only a 15-minute commute from downtown to the southern suburbs.</font> There are no other major problems right now,<font color=""#038041""> but remember that the lake bridge westbound will be closed from 9 to midnight tonight for pavement repair.</font> Now, back to the baseball game on KPLZ."

"You know, that's the question I'm probably asked the most: Why? Sometimes I wonder myself.<font color=""#038041""> It's hard work to start a business, any business. So why do I work so hard to start one, get it going, and then walk away to start another one from scratch...? I don't know, really.</font> It's not for the money. If I wanted to get rich I'd make one business enormously successful, then sell it. I guess it's in my DNA. I love the challenge of creating something -- of seeing my dreams spring to life. But once they do, the excitement's gone, and I'm ready for something else. I think the first sign I would be a businessman was when I was nine, and a friend and I started renting our used DVDs to the neighborhood kids. I started my first business at age 13 -- a lawn-mowing service -- and I've been creating companies ever since. Not all of them have been successful, but I think I've learned more from my failures than my successes.<font color=""#038041""> This current venture is my 12th start-up company. Five have failed, but six are going strong, so I'm batting better than five-hundred. I'm 60, I'm still in good health, I love what I do -- so I see myself doing this until the day I die.</font>"

"Thank you all for coming.<font color=""#038041""> After considering several factors, including the questionnaires you completed last spring, we've decided that we're going to switch to four-day workweeks, beginning next month.</font> We will work 10 hours a day, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., on Monday through Thursday.<font color=""#038041""> The office will be closed Fridays. Though we will still work 40 hours a week, we estimate that this change will reduce our energy use by 15 percent, </font>and will also save each of you, on average, about $20 a month in gas and transportation costs. Overall, this change will significantly cut our company's greenhouse transmissions and reduce our carbon footprint. To save even more energy, we will be installing compact fluorescent light bulbs -- CFLs -- in every light socket at the start of next week. During the changeover period, we understand that some of you, particularly those with young children, might need special accommodations as you adjust to a four-day week.<font color=""#038041""> If you have troubles or concerns, let your manager know.</font> We'll be happy to help you any way we can. Though this might be traumatic at first, we're confident that most of you will like the new schedule once you've grown accustomed to the change."

"<font color=""#038041"">This is Tom Moran with a KST-AM traffic update. Volume on the two major east-west roadways, Interstate 50 and Highway 44, is very heavy this afternoon as people head out of town for the holiday weekend. </font>There are no accidents on either road, but on Interstate 50 there is a 90-minute delay getting over the mountain pass. North-south traffic looks good at this hour. Interstate 3 is mostly clear in both directions, with a little slowing northbound near the City Center exit due to an earlier two-car collision that has been moved off to the shoulder.<font color=""#038041""> We're getting reports now of a backup on Highway 10 southbound near Rodgers Street, where some furniture has fallen off the back of a pickup truck in the far left lane.</font> Police are on the scene, helping the driver pick everything up. This is Tom Moran from the KST-AM traffic center, which provides traffic updates every 20 minutes.

If you're thinking of buying a new car, now's the time!<font color=""#038041""> We have an outstanding selection of new vehicles,</font> and thanks to government incentives, prices have never been better. You can get $900 off a brand new pickup truck, or drive home in a new four-door sedan for only $12,500 after a $2,000 government rebate. That's right, up to $2,000 off hundreds of new cars and trucks! And if you have an old clunker that gets less than 20 miles per gallon, bring it down and trade it in. Not only will we give you a great price for that gas guzzler, we'll also give you an extra $1,000 off the price of a new vehicle under the government's ""cash for clunkers"" program. But you'd better get a move on.<font color=""#038041""> Prices this low won't last long. We're on Tri-Cities Motorway near the junction of Interstate 40. Right now we're open 9 to 9 Monday through Friday, and 8-10 on Saturday and Sunday. Tell them Tammy sent you, and we'll give you your car's first oil change for free!</font>"

This was a great chance for our company to make explicit what we knew implicitly: Our products are a great value. So we spent money for a new advertising campaign with phrases like ""Quality for less,"" ""shop smart,"" and ""style on a budget."" As a result, our sales have increased each of the past three quarters. Think creatively.<font color=""#038041""> Act aggressively. We can't predict exactly when the broad economy will recover, but your company's recovery can begin whenever you're ready.</font> Don't wait; innovate!"

"<font color=""#038041"">From the WJAM eye in the sky, this is Abby Adams with a 3 p.m. traffic update. There is a huge backup right now on the interstate freeway southbound near the Fifth Street exit, due to a car-truck collision.</font> Police and aid cars are on the scene, and it looks like it's going to take awhile to clear it up. The right two lanes are blocked, but the two left lanes are open, and there's a police officer directing vehicles. Northbound traffic on the interstate is also bottle-necking through that area as drivers slow to take a look. But that congestion should ease in a few minutes, as we see traffic authorities getting ready to switch the special express lanes from southbound to northbound at 3:30. Traffic on other major roadways looks normal at this hour. This is Abby Adams from the WJAM eye in the sky. Traffic is brought to you by Yummy Oatmeal, the breakfast that provides a full day's supply of 11 vitamins and iron.

"This is Jim Johnson with Travel Talk. It's summer and it's vacation time.<font color=""#038041""> For some people this means long hours in the car and on the highway. Here are some tips to help you stay safe while on the road.</font> First, the Do's. If you're traveling with more than one driver,<font color=""#038041""> try to switch drivers occasionally so that you don't spend too much time behind the wheel. Remember to stop frequently and take a break.</font> Make sure you know the signs of drowsiness: missing road signs, difficulty focusing, and yawning. Now the Don'ts. Don't count on distractions such as the radio or an open window to keep you awake. And even though a cup of coffee might give you a lift, remember that the effects of caffeine wear off after a short time. Finally, don't drive between midnight and morning.<font color=""#038041""> Tune in again tomorrow and we'll talk about vacation destinations that both adults and children will enjoy.</font>

If you're traveling with more than one driver,<font color=""#038041""> try to switch drivers occasionally so that you don't spend too much time behind the wheel. Remember to stop frequently and take a break.</font> Make sure you know the signs of drowsiness: missing road signs, difficulty focusing, and yawning. Now the Don'ts. Don't count on distractions such as the radio or an open window to keep you awake. And even though a cup of coffee might give you a lift, remember that the effects of caffeine wear off after a short time. Finally, don't drive between midnight and morning.<font color=""#038041""> Tune in again tomorrow and we'll talk about vacation destinations that both adults and children will enjoy.</font>

"Toronto is one of the largest cities in Canada. It is located in the province of Ontario. A special feature of Toronto is the downtown area covering about twelve square kilometers where many shops and buildings are located underground. There are five major shopping centers and a convention center with hotels. A subway and underground passageways connect these buildings with each other and the streets above. The architectural design is appropriate and popular because of the weather conditions in Toronto.<font color=""#038041""> The temperature fluctuates widely from summer to winter by as much as 40 degrees Celsius within a year. This underground area has also helped to keep business in the city center instead of moving out to the suburbs, which is happening in many other cities.</font> We think that makes Toronto a special place."

"<font color=""#038041"">Ok, if I could have your attention please. We have a new board member to formally introduce today.</font> I say new because he's new to those of you sitting at this table, but not to many of you personally. John Clayton has been with the firm for almost 20 years now.<font color=""#038041""> He started as a hardware technician and worked his way up to senior manager, then systems director, and finally to his current position of vice president in charge of research and development. Since you're all familiar with John's work, I want to tell you a little about his personal life. John is married with three wonderful children, ages 12, 9 and 7. Last year, his 9-year-old, Luke, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. This was of course terrible news for John and his wife Karen, but they have helped Luke battle the sickness, and he is doing very well. During this difficult period, John was able to do his job despite missing several weeks attending to his family.</font> His election to our board of directors is a testament to his courage, perseverance, and high personal standards. John replaces Martin Lynch, who retired last November, and though those are big shoes to fill,<font color=""#038041""> I am confident that he is more than up to the task. But enough blather from me.

"Thank you for coming today. My name is Shirley Preston,<font color=""#038041""> and I'm the corporate communications officer for Furniture City Inc. I am pleased to announce that we will be opening a new Furniture City store this April at 53 Parkway Street, opposite the Parkway Mall. </font>This will be our third location in the city, and our largest store yet, with 6,000 square feet. Our stores are renowned for providing quality furniture at reasonable prices, and this store will be no exception. It will employ 30 persons, and we expect it to generate more than $2 million a year for the city in tax revenue. This is another measure of the growth of Furniture City, which began four years ago in a small office on Clark Street. Maurice Alberts, our founder and president, has expanded the company in the space of that time to one of the fastest-growing firms in our state. Revenues for Furniture City rose 10 percent last year, and are up to 2 percent for the first quarter of this year. In addition to this new store, we have plans to expand soon into other cities in the state.<font color=""#038041""> At this time, I will field any questions that you have, either about our new store or our company in general.</font>"

Consumers want discipline, and if we can bring that discipline of paying in full at the end of the month along with the service levels that we provide, plus the rewards and other programs we have, we think that's a tremendous opportunity for us to grow.<font color=""#038041""> We also believe there are substantial opportunities in partnering with banks to issue Vista-branded credit cards, and we've had very strong success doing it globally.</font> Another area we feel strongly about is that we have information we can use in very effective ways for a range of partners. We believe that our information, which we use in our own business and marketing, can be used by retailers, restaurants, and other corporations to improve their business, and that's an increasing area of focus for us.

"<font color=""#038041"">Now it's time for a WPMZ traffic update, brought to you by Dick's Delicatessens.</font> I'm Cindy Cowherd in the Dick's Traffic center. Southbound Interstate 9 is busy from the county line to the downtown convention center, and again from South Street to Maple Hill. Northbound 9 starts to slow near Gigantic Mall, and is heavy from there all the way to Shoreview Heights. On eastbound Route 222, traffic is flowing again across the bridge now that an earlier accident has been cleared to the side. On west 222, <font color=""#038041"">we're getting reports of a stalled car blocking the right lane of the First Avenue on-ramp. Traffic is backed up along First Avenue to the scene.</font> Otherwise, the roads look pretty good, and there are no blockages to report at this time. <font color=""#038041"">WPMZ traffic reports are sponsored by Dick's Delis.</font> Come into Dick's this weekend for $2 off a large submarine sandwich, or $3 off any lunch combination plate. This is Cindy Cowherd from the Dick's traffic center.
