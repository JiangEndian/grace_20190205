"adj. comparable  The psychology researcher’s experiment postulates that the brain is analogous to a digital computer.  Analogy is a noun meaning a similarity in some ways between things that are otherwise dissimilar.  The idea of evolution in nature is sometimes misconstrued and applied by analogy to other areas in which there is scant evidence for its existence; a notable example of this is Social Darwinism, in which it is argued that society is like nature, and thus people, like animals, are competing for survival, with those who are genetically superior at surviving and reproducing.  Analog is a noun meaning something that is comparable to something else.  Some commentators have posited the existence of an analog to the Protestant work ethic in Chinese culture, which they call the “Confucian work ethic,” to explain the economic success of some countries with large Chinese populations.   Terms from the Arts, Sciences, and Social Sciences  Social Darwinism: a theory in sociology that individuals or groups achieve advantage over others as the result of genetic or biological superiority  Protestant work ethic: a view of life that encourages hard work and a rational view of the world as a way to achieve material success  Confucian: a system or ethics based on the teachings of the ancient Chinese sage Confucius.

"n. absence of government; state of disorder  The American philosopher Robert Nozick does not advocate anarchy; rather, he argues for the merits of a minimal state that would not violate the natural rights of individuals.  The adjective anarchic means lacking order or control.  The student of mythology speculated that Dionysos was created as a projection of the pleasure-loving, anarchic aspect of human nature.   Terms from the Arts, Sciences, and Social Sciences  Dionysos: known as Bacchus to the Romans, Dionysos was the son of Zeus and Selene. He was the Greek god of agriculture, fertility, wine, and ecstasy, and later regarded as a patron of the arts. Dionysos was worshipped by an emotional cult that held secret rites called Bacchanalia—wild orgies of frenzied revelry, drunkenness, and debauchery.   The noun anarchism refers to the theory that all forms of government are oppressive and should be abolished. It also means the advocacy of this theory or the attempt to bring about anarchism.

The plural of stratum is strata.  As it matured as a science, geology began to complement biology, a process that helped it to gain a more comprehensive view of the history of life on Earth by allowing fossils to be dated and identified (paleontology), often using knowledge gained from stratigraphy—the study of the deposition, distribution, and age of rock strata.

"n. one who is fanatically devoted to a cause  The Crusades of the eleventh to thirteenth centuries were conceived of by Christian zealots as a way to drive the Islamic interlopers from the Holy Land.  Zealotry is a noun meaning fanaticism.  The fact that the judicial branch is relatively undemocratic compared to the other two branches of government is justified by some theorists of democracy on the grounds that it serves as a check not only on the legislative branch and executive branch, but also on democratic zealotry.  The adjective zealous means enthusiastically devoted to a cause.  It is heretical to suggest to a zealous capitalist that free enterprise is not the only conceivable realistic economic system."

"v. to approve; ratify; permit  The establishment of the state of Israel from Palestinian territory in 1948 was the realization of a hallowed dream for Zionists, but for many Palestinians it meant the sanctioning of continued domination of their land by Europeans.  Sanction is also a noun meaning approval; ratification; permission.  In the West, the institution of marriage is traditionally given formal sanction by both the Church and the State, which has the social function of reinforcing its importance and the seriousness of the duties it entails.  The noun sanction can also mean penalization.  The United Nations has the power to compel obedience to international law by sanctions or even war, but there must be unanimity for such action among the five permanent members of the Security Council.  The verb sanction can also mean to penalize."
